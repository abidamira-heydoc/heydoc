We’ve all seen the words “complementary,” “alternative,” and “integrative,” but what do they really mean? This fact sheet looks into these terms to help you understand them better and gives you a brief picture of the mission and role of the in this area of re The terms “complementary,” “alternative,” and “integrative” are continually evolving, along with the field, but the descriptions of these terms below are how we at the National Institutes of Health currently define them. Complementary Versus Alternative According to a 2012 national survey, many Americans—more than 30 percent of adults and about 12 percent of children—use health care approaches that are not typically part of conventional medical care or that may have origins outside of usual Western practice. When describing these approaches, people often use “alternative” and “complementary” interchangeably, but the two terms refer to different concepts: If a non-mainstream approach is used together with conventional medicine, it’s considered “complementary.” If a non-mainstream approach is used in place of conventional medicine, it’s considered “alternative.” Most people who use non-mainstream approaches also use conventional health care. In addition to the terms complementary and alternative, you may also hear the term “functional medicine.” This term sometimes refers to a concept similar to integrative health (described below), but it may also refer to an approach that more closely resembles naturopathy (a medical system that has evolved from a combination of traditional practices and health care approaches popular in Europe during the 19th century).

The acai fruit, also known as acai berry, has long been an important food source for the indigenous people there, who also attribute healing powers to various parts of the plant. Different parts of the acai plant have been used in folk medicine for treating fever, gastrointestinal and skin conditions, and infectious diseases. Acai products have become popular in the United States. They have been promoted for athletic performance, high cholesterol, erectile dysfunction, obesity, aging skin, metabolic syndrome, and other conditions. The Federal Trade Commission has taken action against companies that marketed acai weight-loss products in allegedly deceptive ways. How Much Do We Know? Very little re has been done in people on the health effects of acai products. What Have We Learned? There is not enough reliable information to say whether acai might be helpful for any health-related purpose. No studies in people have been published in peer-reviewed journals in the last 5 years that substantiate claims that acai promotes weight loss. Laboratory studies support acai’s potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties as well as other potentially beneficial effects. Several small studies have found that acai pulp improves antioxidant defenses in people. What Do We Know About Safety? Acai pulp has been used safely for up to 3 months in clinical re Little re has been done on the safety of acai. Raw acai fruit and juice can be contaminated with parasites.

It is grown in subtropical regions around the world, including the southern border areas of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. Aloe was used in ancient Greece, Rome, Babylonia, and China. Historically, it was used for skin conditions and was thought to prevent premature graying of hair and promote wound healing. Aloe is used topically (applied to the skin) and orally. Topical use of aloe is promoted for acne, psoriasis, lichen planus (a very itchy rash on the skin or in the mouth), oral submucous fibrosis (a disease that causes scars and tissue fibrosis and can involve a burning sensation in the mouth), burns, and skin damage from radiation therapy. Oral use of aloe is promoted for weight loss, diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease (a group of conditions caused by gut inflammation that includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis). Aloe products can be made from various parts of the aloe leaf, including the gel (from the inner leaf), latex (from the leaf’s outer layer), and whole crushed leaf (containing the gel and latex). In 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a ruling that required manufacturers to remove aloe latex from over-the-counter laxative products because of a lack of safety data. The International Agency for Re on Cancer has classified whole leaf extract of aloe vera as a possible carcinogen in humans. (This form, called non-decolorized, has not undergone activated carbon treatment to remove toxic anthraquinone components.) How Much Do We Know?

A small amount of re suggests topical use of aloe also may help people with genital herpes, lichen planus, psoriasis, oral submucous fibrosis, skin damage from radiation therapy, or sores in the mouth from dental appliances. A small amount of re suggests that aloe taken orally may reduce blood sugar and HbA1c in people with diabetes. A small study showed that a specific aloe gel product taken orally for 8 weeks modestly reduced weight and fat mass in adults with obesity or overweight who had diabetes or prediabetes. There is interest in using aloe for many other conditions, but there isn’t enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful for those conditions, which include eczema, diabetic foot ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, and ulcerative colitis. What Do We Know About Safety? Topical use of aloe gel is generally well tolerated; however, there have been occasional reports of burning, itching, rash, and eczema. Re studies suggest that short-term use of oral aloe gel up to 42 days is safe. Oral use of aloe latex can cause abdominal pain, cramps, and diarrhea. Oral consumption of aloe leaf extracts (for as little as 3 weeks and as long as 5 years) has been related to cases of acute hepatitis. Some animal studies have noted an association between a non-decolorized extract of aloe vera leaf taken orally and gastrointestinal cancer in rats and mice; most toxicity and safety studies in animals have tested non-decolorized whole leaf extract of aloe vera, which is not commonly used by consumers.

It contains several bioactive compounds, including a group of substances known as withanolides. Withanolides have been associated with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Ashwagandha has been in use as a medicinal plant for thousands of years, especially in traditional Ayurvedic medicine. Currently, ashwagandha supplements are often promoted for stress and anxiety, sleep, male infertility, and athletic performance.

It has been used as a calming agent in traditional Chinese medicine and as an adaptogen. (Adaptogenic herbs are thought to help the body resist physiological and psychological stress.) Asian ginseng is one of several types of ginseng. The terms “red ginseng” and “white ginseng” refer to Asian ginseng that is prepared in two different ways. The part of the plant most frequently used for health purposes is the root. Asian ginseng has been promoted for stress, cognitive function, flu, fatigue, athletic performance, diabetes, aging, asthma, anxiety, and other conditions. Asian ginseng contains many substances; those thought to be most important are called ginsenosides (or panaxosides). How Much Do We Know? The amount of re on Asian ginseng for various conditions has gradually increased over recent years. Most of the clinical trials have been small, with fewer than 200 participants, and shorter than 3 months. Larger multicenter studies that last longer than 3 months are needed to improve the clinical evidence of Asian ginseng for different conditions. What Have We Learned? A small amount of re has suggested that Asian ginseng may improve cognitive function, including abstract thinking, attention, arithmetic skills, and reaction time, in middle-aged adults but not in young adults.

However, not all re agrees on Asian ginseng’s possible benefits for fatigue. A 2022 review of 20 studies (1,295 participants) found that Asian ginseng improved many cardiometabolic factors in people with prediabetes and diabetes, including fasting blood glucose levels, total cholesterol, and certain inflammatory markers. But re on the use of Asian ginseng for improving blood sugar control in people with diabetes is overall inconclusive and conflicting. Some re shows that taking oral Asian ginseng seems to improve sexual function in people with erectile dysfunction (ED). Asian ginseng has also been studied in adults with symptoms of ED associated with an enlarged prostate, and one small study suggested it may improve some aspects of sexual function. The majority of re shows that Asian ginseng does not improve athletic performance. There is interest in using Asian ginseng for many other conditions, including aging, asthma, and anxiety, but there isn’t enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful for these conditions. What Do We Know About Safety? Short-term oral use (by mouth, up to 6 months) of Asian ginseng in recommended amounts appears to be safe for most people.

Its root has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine, often in combination with other herbs. Astragalus is considered an adaptogen, which is a natural substance theorized to stimulate the body’s resistance to physical, environmental, and emotional stress. Sometimes combined with other herbs, astragalus has been promoted as a dietary supplement for many conditions, including upper respiratory infections, allergic rhinitis (hay fever), asthma, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes.

Its dark berries resemble blueberries. The berries and leaves of the bilberry plant have been used as medicine. Extracts from bilberry fruits and leaves have traditionally been used for conditions related to vision, elevated blood sugar levels, and several cardiovascular disorders. It has been reported that during World War II, British pilots ate bilberry jam, thinking it would improve their night vision. Although this may have been superstition or a deliberate hoax to help conceal improvements in radar, it prompted re on bilberry and night vision. Today, bilberry is promoted as a dietary supplement for eye conditions, circulatory problems, and other conditions. How Much Do We Know? Some re has been done in people on the effect of bilberry on various conditions, but many of the studies did not use rigorous methods and did not include enough study participants to allow definite conclusions to be reached. What Have We Learned? Bilberry has not been clearly shown to be helpful for any health condition. Bilberries contain some substances that may be of interest for further re including anthocyanins, anthocyanosides, tannins, and flavonoids. Studies of the effects of bilberry on night vision have had conflicting results. Much of the re was of poor quality. The most rigorous studies have not found bilberry to be effective in improving night vision in healthy people. What Do We Know About Safety? Bilberry fruit is considered safe when consumed in amounts typically found in foods. Bilberry fruit extracts have been used safely in re studies at doses of up to 160 mg/day for up to 6 months and appear to be well tolerated. Bilberry leaves may be unsafe when consumed in high doses or for long periods of time.",natural_remedy

Its fruit is too sour to eat raw, but the fruit, peel, and essential oils are used in cooking, as flavorings in beer and spirits, and to add aromas to perfumes. Bitter orange is currently promoted as a dietary supplement for weight loss, sports performance, and other uses. Bitter orange oil is used topically and in aromatherapy. The fruit of bitter orange contains p -synephrine and other naturally occurring chemicals. p -Synephrine is structurally similar to ephedrine, the main component in the herb ephedra, but p -synephrine has different pharmacologic properties (how it acts in the body). In 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the use of ephedrine alkaloids (compounds found in Ephedra sinica and some other plants) in dietary supplements because of safety concerns. Prior to the ban, ephedra was an ingredient in some dietary supplements promoted for weight loss, increased energy, and enhanced athletic performance. Bitter orange products became more popular after ephedra was taken off the market and have been promoted as ephedra alternatives. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has placed “synephrine (bitter orange)” on its current list of banned drugs, listing it as a stimulant. How Much Do We Know? Studies have been done on the effects of bitter orange on weight loss or athletic performance in people, but most of them were small, some were not scientifically rigorous, and many evaluated the effects of products that contain a combination of ingredients, making it difficult to distinguish the effects of bitter orange from those of the other components.

Several small studies have evaluated the effects of bitter orange, with or without caffeine, on athletic performance. The results were inconsistent, but most of the studies did not show a beneficial effect. It is unclear whether applying bitter orange oil to the skin is helpful for fungal infections of the skin (ringworm, athlete’s foot, or jock itch). The one study that tested bitter orange oil for these infections did not compare it to other treatments or a placebo, so the study’s results are difficult to interpret. Bitter orange oil has been used in aromatherapy for various conditions including anxiety and insomnia, but it is unclear whether this is beneficial. What Do We Know About Safety? Bitter orange is likely safe when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods. Bitter orange oil is generally well tolerated when used topically or in aromatherapy. Serious concerns have been raised about possible risks of dietary supplements containing bitter orange. Cases of serious medical events, including abnormal heart rhythms, heart attacks, and strokes, have been reported in people who had taken bitter orange products, but most of the products contained multiple ingredients rather than bitter orange alone. Therefore, it is unclear whether bitter orange (or its component p -synephrine) played a role in causing the events. Evidence regarding the effects of bitter orange on the cardiovascular system is inconclusive. Some studies indicate that bitter orange raises blood pressure and heart rate, but others do not.

It has also been used medicinally in Germany since the late 19th century. Currently, black cohosh is promoted as a dietary supplement for menopause symptoms. It has also been promoted for other conditions, including menstrual cramps and premenstrual syndrome, and to induce labor. The part of the black cohosh plant used in herbal preparations is the root or rhizome (underground stem). How Much Do We Know? A substantial number of studies in people have evaluated black cohosh for menopause symptoms. Much less re has been done on black cohosh for other conditions. What Have We Learned? A 2023 review of 22 studies of products containing black cohosh extracts, alone or in combination with other herbs, found that they were potentially beneficial for overall menopause symptoms. Data on specific symptoms showed improvements in hot flashes but not anxiety or depressive symptoms. It’s uncertain whether black cohosh can reduce hot flashes related to breast cancer treatment. There aren’t enough reliable data to show whether black cohosh is effective for other uses. What Do We Know About Safety? While black cohosh has been used safely in re studies that lasted as long as a year and is generally well tolerated, concerns have been raised that it may cause liver damage in some people.

Boswellia is an herbal extract made from the gum resin or bark of the tree and can be taken orally or applied topically. Traditionally, boswellia has been used in Ayurveda practices to improve arthritis, reduce inflammation and pain, and relieve symptoms of some respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and other disorders. Boswellia extracts are sold as dietary supplements to reduce inflammation and to support joint health, mobility, and digestive health. The resin from the bark of Boswellia serrata or other Boswellia species is the source of frankincense, which is often inhaled for aromatherapy or applied topically. How Much Do We Know? There have been several studies on the potential health benefits and safety of using boswellia, but most of these are small and of low quality. There is not enough high-quality evidence to determine whether boswellia is useful for any health condition. What Have We Learned? Several studies have shown taking boswellia orally may help reduce inflammation and pain associated with osteoarthritis, but larger, higher quality studies are needed.

The names for this plant in some other languages translate as “rain hat” or “hat plant,” reflecting another use of the large leaves. Butterbur has been used for health purposes for many centuries. In the Middle Ages, the odor and smoke from burning butterbur roots were thought to fight plague. Today, butterbur is promoted as a dietary supplement for migraine, allergic rhinitis (hay fever), and other conditions. How Much Do We Know? There have been several studies of butterbur for migraines and allergic rhinitis (hay fever) in people, so we have some knowledge of its effects on these two conditions. What Have We Learned?

Extracts of chasteberry may be prepared from the herb’s leaves, stems, flowers, and seeds. The name “chasteberry” may reflect the traditional belief that the plant promoted chastity. In the Middle Ages, chasteberry was reportedly used by monks to decrease sexual desire. Chasteberry was also traditionally used for psychological illnesses, gynecological disorders, and hormone-associated skin conditions. Today, chasteberry is promoted as a dietary supplement for symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), breast pain or tenderness associated with the menstrual cycle, infertility, menopause symptoms, and other conditions. How Much Do We Know? Several studies of low-to-moderate quality in people have evaluated chasteberry for alleviating PMS symptoms such as breast pain or tenderness. There isn’t a lot of strong re on the effectiveness of chasteberry for other conditions. Much re has been conducted on the safety of this herb and has determined that chasteberry supplementation may not be safe for women with hormone-sensitive conditions, such as breast, uterine, or ovarian cancer. Some preclinical evidence states that the use of chasteberry during pregnancy or while breastfeeding may be unsafe. What Have We Learned? Some re has suggested that chasteberry might reduce PMS symptoms such as breast pain or tenderness, but higher-quality evidence is needed to reach any definitive conclusions. One study suggested that chasteberry might reduce heavy menstrual bleeding related to an intrauterine device (IUD), but the evidence is of low quality.

Cranberry has a history of traditional use in dyes, food, and medicine among Native Americans and later European settlers. Cranberry fruits and leaves were thought to have therapeutic effects on disorders of the bladder, stomach, blood, and liver, and on various conditions like wounds, diabetes, and scurvy. Today, cranberry is commonly promoted for urinary tract infections (UTIs) and recurrent UTIs. Cranberry products are promoted for these common infections in part because of a growing interest in nonantibiotic prevention strategies, given concerns about antibiotic-resistant bacteria. How Much Do We Know? There have been many studies on cranberry for the prevention of UTIs, especially among women at increased risk for UTIs or recurrent UTIs. However, some re isn’t of high quality. There’s little re on cranberry for other conditions. What Have We Learned? In general, cranberry products may decrease the overall risk of symptomatic, recurrent UTIs in women by 25 percent, and in some cases, by more than 30 percent. However, the effectiveness of cranberry is still in question because of inconsistent findings. While cranberry may assist in preventing symptomatic UTIs in some women, it isn’t recommended as a treatment for existing UTIs in any population. It’s thought that the proanthocyanidins (PACs) present in cranberries prevent bacteria from sticking to the bladder wall, thus preventing the start of a UTI.

Studies in other high-risk populations, such as women undergoing gynecological surgeries or people with multiple sclerosis, have not found cranberry to be beneficial in reducing the risk for UTIs. Starting in 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has allowed manufacturers to claim on product labels that there is “limited” evidence that daily consumption of specified amounts of cranberry dietary supplements may reduce the risk of recurrent UTIs in healthy women. A similar claim may be made for cranberry juice beverages, but the evidence must be described as “limited and inconsistent.” What Do We Know About Safety? Cranberry taken orally (by mouth) is generally thought to be safe. However, if consumed in very large amounts, cranberry can cause stomach upset and diarrhea, particularly in young children.

Its seeds, which smell and taste like maple syrup, have been used as a spice and a traditional medicine. Because of its maple-like flavor, fenugreek has been used as a flavoring agent in foods, beverages, and tobacco. Fenugreek has been used as a medicinal plant for about 6,000 years. In various cultures, it has been used as a tonic or a laxative; as a remedy for menstrual cramps, menopause symptoms, kidney stones, and other conditions; and to stimulate milk production during breastfeeding. Today, fenugreek seed is promoted as a dietary supplement for diabetes, menstrual cramps, and many other conditions and to stimulate milk production during breastfeeding. How Much Do We Know? There is not enough high-quality evidence to determine whether fenugreek is useful for diabetes or menstrual cramps. A few studies have evaluated the use of fenugreek to increase milk supply in breastfeeding women, with mixed results. More high-quality studies are needed before conclusions can be reached about fenugreek’s effects on these conditions.

Feverfew is native to parts of western Asia and the Balkans, but it now grows throughout the world. Traditionally, people have used feverfew for a variety of purposes, including respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, menstrual disorders, kidney disease, liver disease, tinnitus, earache, fever, infertility, and anemia. Feverfew is currently promoted for migraine headaches, blood vessel relaxation, minor pain (especially in the head, such as tension headaches), and joint support. Topically (applied to the skin), feverfew is promoted to provide relief from itching and skin irritation. Feverfew (also known as European feverfew) is different from American feverfew (Parthenium integrifolium) , a plant native to the eastern United States. How Much Do We Know? Some studies in people have looked into feverfew’s use as a remedy for migraine headache. For instance, a 2020 review looked at 7 studies of feverfew for migraine, which included a total of 634 participants.

To produce green tea, leaves from the plant are steamed, pan fried, and dried but not fermented. Black tea is fermented, and oolong tea is partially fermented. The tea plant was first cultivated in China thousands of years ago. There is evidence of the use of tea for health purposes dating back about 3,000 years. Today, green tea and its extracts are promoted as dietary supplements for losing weight, reducing blood cholesterol levels, and preventing chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer.

It now grows in many parts of the world, including North America. Mugwort was used in traditional Chinese, Hindu, and European medicine for gastrointestinal and gynecological problems. During the Middle Ages, mugwort was known as the “mother of herbs.” Today, mugwort is promoted for oral use for a variety of conditions such as anxiety, menstrual cramps, high blood pressure, and insomnia. It is promoted for topical use in combination with other ingredients for hypertrophic scars (raised scars that may occur as a complication of burn injuries and that may restrict movement). How Much Do We Know? Very little re has been done on mugwort in people. There is not enough evidence to determine whether mugwort is safe or useful for any health condition; therefore, more studies are needed before definitive conclusions can be reached. What Have We Learned? One preliminary study showed that a topical lotion containing mugwort and menthol relieved itching associated with hypertrophic scars. Because the product contained more than one ingredient, it is not clear whether mugwort was responsible for the effect. There’s not enough evidence to say whether mugwort is helpful for any other conditions. What Do We Know About Safety? There’s not enough evidence to know whether it’s safe to take mugwort orally or to use it topically. Mugwort should not be used during pregnancy.

Both peppermint leaves and the essential oil from peppermint have been used for health purposes. Peppermint oil is the essential oil taken from the flowering parts and leaves of the peppermint plant. (Essential oils are very concentrated oils containing substances that give a plant its characteristic odor or flavor.) The medicinal use of mint plants for digestive disorders dates back to ancient Greece, Rome, and Egypt, and peppermint oil has been used for centuries to treat gastrointestinal ailments. Today, peppermint is promoted for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), indigestion, headaches, muscle tension, nausea, and other conditions. How Much Do We Know? A small amount of re has been conducted on peppermint oil, primarily focusing on IBS. Very little re has been done on peppermint leaf. There is not enough evidence to definitely determine whether peppermint leaf is useful for any health condition. What Have We Learned? A small amount of re suggests that peppermint oil in enteric-coated capsules may improve IBS symptoms in adults. A 2022 review of 10 studies (involving 1,030 participants) found that peppermint oil was better than placebo at improving overall IBS symptoms and reducing abdominal pain but caused more side effects than placebo. Most of the side effects were mild and included acid reflux and indigestion.

A 2024 review of 10 studies on aromatherapy, which included 4 studies (involving 290 participants) on peppermint oil, found that inhaling peppermint oil was particularly successful at reducing nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy. A few studies have indicated that specific products containing peppermint oil plus caraway oil and specific combination products that include peppermint leaves may help relieve indigestion. But there isn’t any evidence showing that taking peppermint oil alone can help. In fact, peppermint oil taken alone may worsen indigestion in some people and cause unwanted side effects. A limited amount of evidence suggests that peppermint oil applied topically (on the skin) might relieve tension headaches, and that a gel containing peppermint oil applied topically might reduce the risk of bed sores (pressure ulcers) in bedridden individuals. Peppermint oil in a gel, water, or cream applied topically to the nipple area of breastfeeding women might be helpful for reducing pain and cracked skin. Menthol, which is in peppermint oil, should not be inhaled by or applied to the face of an infant or small child because it may negatively affect their breathing. Peppermint oil should therefore be used only after breastfeeding and then wiped off before the next breastfeeding session.

However, effects may vary for different types of soy products and in different populations. What Have We Learned? Consuming soy protein in place of other proteins may lower cholesterol levels to a small extent. Soy isoflavones may not have the same effect. Soy isoflavone supplements or soy protein may help to reduce the frequency and severity of menopausal hot flashes, but the effect may be small, and re results have not been completely consistent. Observational studies indicate that among Asian and Asian-American women, higher dietary intakes of soy are associated with a lower risk of breast cancer. The amounts of soy in Western diets, even among the highest consumers of soy, may be too low for this association to be observed. Soy products in supplement form have not been shown to reduce breast cancer risk. Soy isoflavones probably have a beneficial effect on bone density in postmenopausal women. Consumption of soy isoflavones may lead to a modest decrease in blood pressure.",natural_remedy

The name St. John’s wort apparently refers to John the Baptist, as the plant blooms around the time of the feast of St. John the Baptist in late June. Historically, St. John’s wort has been used for a variety of conditions, including depression, stomach ulcers, and colds, and to aid wound healing. Currently, St. John’s wort is most widely promoted for symptoms of depression. It is also promoted for menopause symptoms and other conditions. Topical use (application to the skin) of St. John’s wort is promoted for wounds and other skin conditions. How Much Do We Know?

Melatonin supplements may help with certain conditions, such as jet lag, delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, some sleep disorders in children, and anxiety before and after surgery. Jet lag Jet lag affects people when they travel by air across multiple time zones. With jet lag, you may not feel well overall and you may have disturbed sleep, daytime tiredness, impaired functioning, and digestive problems. Re suggests that melatonin supplements may help with jet lag. This is based on medium-sized reviews from 2010 and 2014. Four studies that included a total of 142 travelers showed that melatonin may be better than a placebo (an inactive substance) in reducing overall symptoms of jet lag after eastward flights. Another study of 234 travelers on eastward flights looked at only sleep quality and found low-quality evidence that melatonin may be better than placebo for improving sleep quality. Two studies that included a total of 90 travelers showed that melatonin may be better than a placebo in reducing symptoms of jet lag after westward flights. Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD) People with DSWPD have trouble falling asleep at the usual times and waking up in the morning. They typically have difficulty getting to sleep before 2 to 6 a.m. and would prefer to wake up between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.",natural_remedy
nccih_0061_2,Melatonin,NCCIH (NIH),https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/melatonin,Public Domain,2026-01-11,"Melatonin supplements appear to help with sleep in people with DSWPD, but it’s uncertain whether the benefits outweigh the possible harms. This is based on a clinical practice guideline, a small review, and a more recent study. In 2015, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommended melatonin supplements given at specific times for DSWPD. The recommendation was a weak one, and it came with uncertainty about whether the benefits of melatonin outweigh its potential harms. A 2016 review that looked at a small number of people (52) from two studies showed that melatonin supplements reduced the time it took for people with DSWPD to fall asleep when compared to placebo. On average, it took about 22 minutes less for them to fall asleep. A 2018 randomized controlled trial that lasted 4 weeks and included 307 people with DSWPD found that taking melatonin 1 hour before the desired bedtime combined with going to bed at a set time led to several improvements. Those improvements included falling asleep an average of 34 minutes earlier, better sleep during the first third of the night, and better daytime functioning. Some sleep disorders in children Sleep problems in children can have undesirable effects on their behavior, daytime functioning, and quality of life. Children with certain conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are more prone to sleep problems than other children. There are no overall guidelines on the best approach to improving sleep in children. However, guidelines for specific conditions recommend behavioral treatments, such as good bedtime habits and parent education, as an initial treatment that may be supplemented with medicines. A 2019 review looked at 18 studies of melatonin supplements that included a total of 1,021 children. Most of the studies were small, and all were relatively brief (1 to 13 weeks).",natural_remedy
nccih_0061_3,Melatonin,NCCIH (NIH),https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/melatonin,Public Domain,2026-01-11,"Overall, the studies showed that melatonin was better than placebo for improving both the time to fall asleep and total sleep. The effects of melatonin on behavior and daytime functioning, however, weren’t clear because the studies used different ways to measure these outcomes. The list below shows the review’s results on melatonin’s short-term effects for children with specific conditions. Children with ASD fell asleep 37 minutes earlier and slept 48 minutes longer. Children with ADHD fell asleep 20 minutes earlier and slept 33 minutes longer. Children with atopic dermatitis fell asleep 6.8 minutes earlier and slept 35 minutes longer. Children with chronic sleep-onset insomnia fell asleep 24 minutes earlier and slept 25 minutes longer. Because there aren’t many studies on children and melatonin supplements, there is a lot we don’t know about the use of melatonin in children. For example, there are uncertainties about what dose to use and when to give it, the effects of melatonin use over long periods of time, and whether melatonin’s benefits outweigh its possible risks. Because melatonin is a hormone, it’s possible that melatonin supplements could affect hormonal development, including puberty, menstrual cycles, and overproduction of the hormone prolactin, but we don’t know for sure. Because of these uncertainties, it’s best to work with a health care provider if you’re considering giving a child melatonin for sleep problems. Anxiety before and after surgery Anxiety before and after surgery happens in up to 80 percent of patients. Melatonin supplements appear to be helpful in reducing anxiety before surgery, but it’s unclear if it helps to lower anxiety after surgery. This is a based on a 2015 review. The 2015 review looked at 12 studies that involved 774 people and assessed melatonin supplements for treating anxiety before surgery, anxiety after surgery, or both.",natural_remedy
nccih_0061_4,Melatonin,NCCIH (NIH),https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/melatonin,Public Domain,2026-01-11,"The review found strong evidence that melatonin is better than placebo at reducing anxiety before surgery. Melatonin supplements may be as effective as standard treatment (the antianxiety medicine midazolam). However, the results on melatonin’s benefits for reducing anxiety after surgery were mixed. Is melatonin helpful for preventing or treating COVID-19? Current re looking at the effects of melatonin on COVID-19 is only in the early stages. There are a few randomized controlled trials (studies evaluating melatonin in people) in progress. At this point, it is too soon to reach conclusions on whether melatonin is helpful for COVID-19. Does melatonin help with cancer symptoms? Studies of the effect of melatonin supplements on cancer symptoms or treatment-related side effects have been small and have had mixed results. Keep in mind that unproven products should not be used to replace or delay conventional medical treatment for cancer. Also, some products can interfere with standard cancer treatments or have special risks for people who’ve been diagnosed with cancer. Before using any complementary health approach, including melatonin, people who’ve been diagnosed with cancer should talk with their health care providers to make sure that all aspects of their care work together. Can melatonin help with insomnia? People with insomnia have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or both. When symptoms last a month or longer, it’s called chronic insomnia. According to practice guidelines from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (2017) and the American College of Physicians (2016), there’s not enough strong evidence on the effectiveness or safety of melatonin supplementation for chronic insomnia to recommend its use. The American College of Physicians guidelines strongly recommend the use of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as an initial treatment for insomnia. Does melatonin work for shift workers?",natural_remedy
nccih_0061_5,Melatonin,NCCIH (NIH),https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/melatonin,Public Domain,2026-01-11,"Shift work that involves night shifts may cause people to feel sleepy at work and make it difficult to sleep during the daytime after a shift ends. According to two 2014 re reviews, studies on whether melatonin supplements help shift workers were generally small or inconclusive. The first review looked at 7 studies that included a total of 263 participants. The results suggested that (1) people taking melatonin may sleep about 24 minutes longer during the daytime, but (2) other aspects of sleep, such as time needed to fall asleep, may not change. The evidence, however, was considered to be of low quality. The other review looked at 8 studies (5 of which were also in the first review), with a total of 300 participants, to see whether melatonin helped promote sleep in shift workers. Six of the studies were high quality, and they had inconclusive results. The review did not make any recommendations for melatonin use in shift workers. Is it safe to take melatonin? For melatonin supplements, particularly at doses higher than what the body normally produces, there’s not enough information yet about possible side effects to have a clear picture of overall safety. Short-term use of melatonin supplements appears to be safe for most people, but information on the long-term safety of supplementing with melatonin is lacking. Also keep in mind: Interactions with medicines As with all dietary supplements, people who are taking medicine should consult their health care providers before using melatonin. In particular, people with epilepsy and those taking blood thinner medications need to be under medical supervision when taking melatonin supplements. Possible allergic reaction risk There may be a risk of allergic reactions to melatonin supplements. Safety concerns for pregnant and breastfeeding women There’s been a lack of re on the safety of melatonin use in pregnant or breastfeeding women.",natural_remedy
nccih_0061_6,Melatonin,NCCIH (NIH),https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/melatonin,Public Domain,2026-01-11,"Safety concerns for older people The 2015 guidelines by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommend against melatonin use by people with dementia. Melatonin may stay active in older people longer than in younger people and cause daytime drowsiness. Melatonin is regulated as a dietary supplement In the United States, melatonin is considered a dietary supplement. This means that it’s regulated less strictly by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) than a prescription or over-the-counter drug would be. In several other countries, melatonin is available only with a prescription and is considered a drug. Products may not contain what’s listed on the label Some melatonin supplements may not contain what’s listed on the product label. A 2017 study tested 31 different melatonin supplements bought from grocery stores and pharmacies. For most of the supplements, the amount of melatonin in the product didn’t match what was listed on the product label. Also, 26 percent of the supplements contained serotonin, a hormone that can have harmful effects even at relatively low levels. Is melatonin safe for children? In addition to issues mentioned above, there are some things to consider regarding melatonin’s safety in children. Parents considering giving their children melatonin should first speak with a health care provider about melatonin use in children. A 2023 study found that 22 out of 25 over-the-counter melatonin gummy products were inaccurately labeled. One product did not contain detectable levels of melatonin. In the remaining products, the melatonin levels ranged from 74 to 347 percent of the labeled quantity (i.e., up to almost 3.5 times more melatonin than reported on the label). Most had more than the label said, with the majority containing between 1.2 to 1.7 times more melatonin than the amount listed. Parents need to ensure safe storage and appropriate use of melatonin supplements. Based on case surveillance data, a 2024 report by the U.S.",natural_remedy
nccih_0061_7,Melatonin,NCCIH (NIH),https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/melatonin,Public Domain,2026-01-11,"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that from 2019 to 2022, 11,000 emergency department visits were for unsupervised melatonin ingestion by children 5 years and younger. The report noted that many of the incidents involved ingestion of flavored products such as gummies and emphasized the importance of keeping medications and supplements out of children’s reach and sight. Use of over-the-counter melatonin might place children and teenagers at risk for accidental or intentional overdose. A 2022 study indicated that U.S. sales of melatonin—which is widely available in tablet, capsule, liquid, and gummy formulations—increased by about 150 percent between 2016 and 2020. The study authors said that the increase in sales, availability, and widespread use of melatonin in the United States has likely resulted in increased access to melatonin among children in the home. The 2022 study also showed that the number of reports to U.S. poison control centers about people 19 years and younger who took melatonin increased from 8,337 in 2012 to 52,563 in 2021. Over the 10-year period, the number of reports increased each year. Hospitalizations and serious outcomes from melatonin ingestion by people 19 years and younger also increased over the 10 years. Most hospitalizations involved teenagers who had intentionally taken melatonin overdoses, and the largest increase in hospitalizations occurred in children 5 years and younger.",natural_remedy
