Abstract: Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most common type of chronic recurring head pain. It can occur twice as often in women as in men. It is the most common type of headache. Its lifetime prevalence is 30% to 78% in the general population. TTH treatment should be multilevel. It often consists of taking pain medication, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, using biofeedback therapy, acupuncture, and attending behavioral therapy. Several clinical trials also suggest that botulinum toxin (BTX) may be an effective treatment option for such patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate if BTX can be used as a treatment method in TTH in the light of current medical literature. The authors searched the PubMed, EBSCOhost, OVID, Web of Knowledge, Cochrane Library and CINAHL databases to identify relevant publications. The authors finally included 11 papers—prospective and retrospective cohort studies. Among most of the selected studies, there was a significant correlation between using BTX and reduction of TTH pain intensity and severity. By analyzing qualified studies, it can be concluded that botulinum toxin seems to be effective in TTH management.",systematic_review

Abstract: Widely accepted quality indicators for headache care would provide a basis not only for assessment of care but also, and more importantly, for its improvement. The objective of the study was to identify and summarize existing information on such indicators: specifically, did indicators exist, how had they been developed, what aspects of headache care did they relate to and how and with what utility were they being used? A systematic review of the medical literature was performed. A total of 32 articles met criteria for inclusion. We identified 55 existing headache quality indicators of which 37 evaluated processes of headache care. Most were relevant only to specific populations of patients and to care delivered in high-resource settings. Indicators had been used to describe overall quality of headache care at a national level, but not systematically applied to the evaluation and improvement of headache services in other settings. Some studies had evaluated the use of existing disability and quality of life instruments, but their findings had not been incorporated into quality indicators. Existing headache care quality indicators are incomplete and inadequate for purpose. They emphasize processes of care rather than structure or outcomes, and are not widely applicable to different levels and locations of headache care. Furthermore, they do not fully incorporate accepted evidence regarding optimal methods of care. There is a clear need for consensus-based indicators that fully reflect patients’ and public-health priorities.",systematic_review

Abstract: Although monosodium glutamate (MSG) is classified as a causative substance of headache in the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-III beta), there is no literature in which causal relationship between MSG and headache was comprehensively reviewed. We performed systematic review of human studies which include the incidence of headache after an oral administration of MSG. An analysis was made by separating the human studies with MSG administration with or without food, because of the significant difference of kinetics of glutamate between those conditions (Am J Clin Nutr 37:194–200, 1983; J Nutr 130:1002S–1004S, 2000) and there are some papers which report the difference of the manifestation of symptoms after MSG ingestion with or without food (Food Chem Toxicol 31:1019–1035, 1993; J Nutr 125:2891S-2906S, 1995). Of five papers including six studies with food, none showed a significant difference in the incidence of headache except for the female group in one study. Of five papers including seven studies without food, four studies showed a significant difference. Many of the studies involved administration of MSG in solution at high concentrations (>2 %). Since the distinctive MSG is readily identified at such concentrations, these studies were thought not to be properly blinded. Because of the absence of proper blinding, and the inconsistency of the findings, we conclude that further studies are required to evaluate whether or not a causal relationship exists between MSG ingestion and headache.",systematic_review

Abstract: Headache is increasingly being reported as a detrimental effect of mobile phone (MP) use. However, studies aimed to investigate the association between MP use and headache yielded conflicting results. To assess the consistency of the data on the topic, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available cross-sectional studies. Published literature from PubMed and other databases were retrieved and screened, and 7 cross-sectional studies were finally included in this meta-analysis. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. We found that the risk of headache was increased by 38% in MP user compared with non-MP user (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.18–1.61, p < 0.001). Among MP users, the risk of headache was also increased in those who had longer daily call duration (2–15 min vs. <2 min: OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.34–1.98, p < 0.001; >15 min vs. <2 min: OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.76–3.54, p < 0.001) and higher daily call frequency (2–4 calls vs. <2 calls: OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.07–1.76, p < 0.001; >4 calls vs. <2 calls: OR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.78–3.58, p < 0.001).

Abstract: ObjectiveIbuprofen is used to prevent high altitude headache (HAH) but its efficacy remains controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) of ibuprofen for the prevention of HAH.MethodsStudies reporting efficacy of ibuprofen for prevention of HAH were identified by searching electronic databases (until December 2016). The primary outcome was the difference in incidence of HAH between ibuprofen and placebo groups. Risk ratios (RR) were aggregated using a Mantel-Haenszel random effect model. Heterogeneity of included trials was assessed using the I2 statistics.ResultsIn three randomized-controlled clinical trials involving 407 subjects, HAH occurred in 101 of 239 subjects (42%) who received ibuprofen and 96 of 168 (57%) who received placebo (RR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96, Z = 2.43, P = 0.02, I2 = 0%). The absolute risk reduction (ARR) was 15%. Number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent HAH was 7. Similarly, The incidence of severe HAH was significant in the two groups (RR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.93, Z = 2.14, P = 0.03, I2 = 0%). Severe HAH occurred in 3% treated with ibuprofen and 10% with placebo. The ARR was 8%. NNT to prevent severe HAH was 13. Headache severity using a visual analogue scale was not different between ibuprofen and placebo. Similarly, the difference between the two groups in the change in SpO2 from baseline to altitude was not different.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundHeadache diaries are often used by headache sufferers to self-monitor headaches. With advances in mobile technology, mobile electronic diary apps are becoming increasingly common.ObjectiveThis review aims to identify and evaluate all commercially available mobile headache diary apps for the two most popular mobile phone platforms, iOS and Android.MethodsThe authors developed a priori a set of 7 criteria that define an ideal headache diary app intended to help headache sufferers better understand and manage their headaches, while providing relevant data to health professionals. The app criteria were intended as minimum requirements for an acceptable headache diary app that could be prescribed by health care professionals. Each app was evaluated and scored against each criterion.ResultsOf the 38 apps identified, none of the apps met all 7 app criteria. The 3 highest scoring apps, meeting 5 of the app criteria, were iHeadache (developed by Better QOL), ecoHeadache (developed by ecoTouchMedia), and Headache Diary Pro (developed by Froggyware). Only 18% of the apps were created with scientific or clinical headache expertise and none of the apps reported on psychometric properties.ConclusionsDespite the growing market and demand, there is a concerning lack of scientific expertise and evidence base associated with headache diary apps.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundThere are many potential causes of sudden and severe headache (thunderclap headache), the most important of which is aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. Published academic reviews report a wide range of causes. We sought to create a definitive list of causes, other than aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, using a systematic review.MethodsSystematic Review of EMBASE and MEDLINE databases using pre-defined search criteria up to September 2009. We extracted data from any original research paper or case report describing a case of someone presenting with a sudden and severe headache, and summarized the published causes.ResultsOur search identified over 21,000 titles, of which 1224 articles were scrutinized in full. 213 articles described 2345 people with sudden and severe headache, and we identified 6 English language academic review articles. A total of 119 causes were identified, of which 46 (38%) were not mentioned in published academic review articles. Using capture-recapture analysis, we estimate that our search was 98% complete. There is only one population-based estimate of the incidence of sudden and severe headache at 43 cases per 100,000. In cohort studies, the most common causes identified were primary headaches or headaches of uncertain cause. Vasoconstriction syndromes are commonly mentioned in case reports or case series. The most common cause not mentioned in academic reviews was pneumocephalus. 70 non-English language articles were identified but these did not contain additional causes.ConclusionsThere are over 100 different published causes of sudden and severe headache, other than aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.",systematic_review

Abstract: ObjectiveTo systematically review the qualitative literature of the lived experience of people with a chronic headache disorder.BackgroundChronic headaches affect 3%–4% of the population. The most common chronic headache disorders are chronic migraine, chronic tension-type headache and medication overuse headache. We present a systematic review and meta-ethnographic synthesis of the lived experience of people with chronic headache.MethodsWe searched seven electronic databases, hand-searched nine journals and used a modified Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist to appraise study quality. Following thematic analysis we synthesised the data using a meta-ethnographic approach.ResultsWe identified 3586 unique citations; full texts were examined for 86 studies and 4 were included in the review. Included studies differed in their foci: exploring, patient-centred outcomes, chronic headache as a socially invisible disease, psychological processes mediating impaired quality of life, and the process of medication overuse. Initial thematic analysis and subsequent synthesis gave three overarching themes: ‘headache as a driver of behaviour’ (directly and indirectly), ‘the spectre of headache’ and ‘strained relationships’.ConclusionThis meta-synthesis of published qualitative evidence demonstrates that chronic headaches have a profound effect on people’s lives, showing similarities with other pain conditions.

Abstract: Abstract Background. Migraine and obesity are highly prevalent and chronic diseases. Evidence has shown that obesity may influence frequency and severity of migraine attacks and is a risk factor for migraine progression. Several studies have suggested that weight loss, achieved via surgical and non-surgical means, may improve migraine. Aim. To perform a meta-analysis on the effect of weight loss obtained by bariatric surgery or behavioral intervention on migraine frequency and indices of severity. Methods. A search through Pubmed/Medline, ISI-web of knowledge and Google Scholar retrieved 10 studies (n=473) that were used for meta-analysis. Selected outcomes were Headache Frequency, Pain Intensity, Disability and Attack Duration while BMI, BMI change, type of intervention (bariatric vs behavioral), type of population (adult vs pediatric) were used for moderators and meta-regression analysis. Results. Random effect meta-analysis shows that weight loss yields significant reductions in Headache Frequency (ES -0.65, 95% C.I. -0.88 to -0.42, p<0.0001), Pain Intensity (ES -0.81, 95% C.I. -1.19 to -0.44, p<0.0001), Disability (ES -0.61, 95% C.I. -0.77 to -0.45, p<0.0001) and Attack Duration (ES -0.35, 95% C.I. -0.62 to -0.08, p=0.01). Moderators and meta-regression analysis showed that improvement in migraine was not correlated either to the degree of obesity at baseline or the degree of weight reduction. In addition, the effect on migraine was similar when weight reduction was obtained with bariatric surgery or behavioral intervention and was comparable in adult and pediatric populations.

Abstract: BackgroundObservational data have reported associations between patent foramen ovale (PFO), cryptogenic stroke and migraine. However, randomized trials of PFO closure do not demonstrate a clear benefit either because the underlying association is weaker than previously suggested or because the trials were underpowered. In order to resolve the apparent discrepancy between observational data and randomized trials, we investigated associations between (1) migraine and ischemic stroke, (2) PFO and ischemic stroke, and (3) PFO and migraine.MethodsEligibility criteria were consistent; including all studies with specifically defined exposures and outcomes unrestricted by language. We focused on studies at lowest risk of bias by stratifying analyses based on methodological design and quantified associations using fixed-effects meta-analysis models.ResultsWe included 37 studies of 7,686 identified. Compared to reports in the literature as a whole, studies with population-based comparators showed weaker associations between migraine with aura and cryptogenic ischemic stroke in younger women (OR 1.4; 95% CI 0.9–2.0; 1 study), PFO and ischemic stroke (HR 1.6; 95 CI 1.0–2.5; 2 studies; OR 1.3; 95% CI 0.9–1.9; 3 studies), or PFO and migraine (OR 1.0; 95% CI 0.6–1.6; 1 study). It was not possible to look for interactions or effect modifiers. These results are limited by sources of bias within individual studies.ConclusionsThe overall pairwise associations between PFO, cryptogenic ischemic stroke and migraine do not strongly suggest a causal role for PFO. Ongoing randomized trials of PFO closure may need larger numbers of participants to detect an overall beneficial effect.",systematic_review

Abstract: Evidence suggests that migraine activity is influenced by hormonal factors, and particularly by estrogen levels, but relatively few studies have investigated the prevalence and characteristics of migraine according to the menopausal status. Overall, population-based studies have shown an improvement of migraine after menopause, with a possible increase in perimenopause. On the contrary, the studies performed on patients referring to headache centers have shown no improvement or even worsening of migraine. Menopause etiology may play a role in migraine evolution during the menopausal period, with migraine improvement more likely occurring after spontaneous rather than after surgical menopause. Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy has been found to be associated with migraine worsening in observational population-based studies. The effects of several therapeutic regimens on migraine has also been investigated, leading to nonconclusive results. To date, no specific preventive measures are recommended for menopausal women with migraine. There is a need for further research in order to clarify the relationship between migraine and hormonal changes in women, and to quantify the real burden of migraine after the menopause. Hormonal manipulation for the treatment of refractory postmenopausal migraine is still a matter of debate.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundThe association between patent foramen ovale (PFO) and migraine with aura (MA) is well established. However, the benefits of PFO closure are less certain in patients with migraine without aura (MwoA).MethodsWe systematically searched Pubmed for pertinent clinical studies published from January 2000 to July 2015. The primary end-point was the elimination or significant improvement of migraine symptoms after PFO closure.ResultsUpon screening an initial list of 315 publications, we identified eight studies that included 546 patients. Overall, our analysis indicated a significant improvement of migraine in 81% of MA cases compared to only 63% of MwoA cases. The summary odds ratio was 2.5 (95% confidence interval 1.09–5.73), and the benefits of PFO closure were significantly greater for patients with MA compared to patients with MwoA (P = 0.03).ConclusionsThe presence of aura provides a reference standard for the clinical selection of patients with migraine for PFO closure intervention.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12872-017-0644-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",systematic_review

The aim of this study was to analyze the available evidence on the effect of aspirin as a migraine prophylactic. DESIGN AND SETTING: Systematic review, conducted at the Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná, Brazil, and at the University of São Paulo, Brazil.METHODS: We performed electronic searches in the databases of MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, WEB OF SCIENCE, the World Health Organization, CENTRAL and OpenGrey, and we also searched manually for interventional studies published before April 2016 that compared the effects of aspirin with a control, in adults. Two authors independently extracted data on the publication, population recruited, intervention (aspirin dosage, follow-up and combined treatment) and main outcomes (frequency, severity and duration of migraine). We evaluated the quality of the studies using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.RESULTS: Our search retrieved 1,098 references, of which 8 met the selection criteria for this systematic review. The total population was 28,326 participants (18-64 years old); most (96%) were men. The dosage varied from 50 to 650 mg/day across the studies. The risk of bias was generally low or unclear. The only outcome for which most of the studies included (6/8) reported a significant reduction was frequency of migraine, which was reduced at an aspirin dosage of at least 325 mg/day.CONCLUSION: Aspirin can reduce the frequency of migraines. However, the optimal dosage is unclear.",systematic_review

Abstract: IntroductionMultiple interventions are effective for migraine prophylaxis. However, the comparative effectiveness of these interventions is still not clear. Therefore, the aim of this study is to summarise the direct and indirect evidence for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to prevent migraine attack.Methods and analysisWe will perform an umbrella systematic review to identify eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for the recommended interventions for migraine prophylaxis according to the guidelines. A comprehensive literature search will be conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane library for systematic reviews, which will be screened for RCTs. We will describe the general information of the RCTs for participants, interventions, outcome measurements, comparisons and the primary findings. Additionally, a network meta-analysis will be conducted to determine the comparative effectiveness of the treatments with a random-effects model. The absolute and relative effectiveness of the treatments will be provided. The heterogeneity and inconsistency between trials will be assessed by the I2 statistical test and Cochrane's Q test. Risk of bias will be assessed and the overall strength of the evidence will be summarised.DiscussionThe result of this network meta-analysis will provide direct and indirect evidence of treatments for migraine prophylaxis, and it may provide a ranking of the treatments for patients and clinicians to help them select the best option.Trial registration numberPROSPERO CRD42015015297.",systematic_review

Abstract: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with a number of human disorders, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, frailty, and infections. Since an association between vitamin D and migraine has also been recently speculated, we performed an electronic search on Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science using the keywords “migraine” and “vitamin D,” “25OH-D” “cholecalciferol,” “ergocalciferol,” with no language or date restriction. The electronic search allowed identifying seven studies (3 observational, 2 cross-sectional, and 2 case reports). The two case reports, including four women, showed favourable effects of vitamin D supplementation on migraine severity, but these studies were small and not placebo controlled. As regards the three observational studies, vitamin D deficiency was observed in 13.2 to 14.8% of migraine patients, and these rates do not differ from those reported in the general population (i.e., vitamin D deficiency between 22 and 42%). The results of the two cross-sectional studies are even more controversial, since no association was found between vitamin D status and migraine in both trials. In conclusion, the current evidence suggests that the association between migraine and vitamin D lacks reliable scientific support.",systematic_review

Abstract: Randomized clinical trials (RCT) assessing the efficacy and tolerability of triptans compared with placebo as short-term prophylaxis of menstrual migraine (MM) were systematically reviewed in this study. Triptans, which interfere with the pathogenesis of migraine and are effective in relieving associated neurovegetative symptoms, have been extensively proposed for prevention of menstrual migraine attacks. We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE for randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials on triptans for MM until 1 Oct, 2012. A total of six RCTs were identified. Two authors independently assessed trial’s quality and extracted data. Numbers of participants free from MM per perimenstrual period (PMP), requiring rescue medication, suffering from headache-associated symptoms and experiencing adverse events in treatment and control groups were used to calculate relative risk (RR) and number needed to treat (NNT) with their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of 633 participants received frovatriptan 2.5 mg QD, 584 received frovatriptan 2.5 mg BID, 392 received naratriptan 1 mg BID, 70 received naratriptan 2.5 mg BID, 80 received zolmitriptan 2.5 mg BID, 83 received zolmitriptan 2.5 mg TID and 1104 received placebo. Overall, triptans is an effective, short-term, prophylactic treatment of choice for MM. Considering MM frequency, severity and adverse events, frovatriptan 2.5 mg BID and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg TID tend to be the preferred regimens.",systematic_review

Abstract: Patients with migraine often report cognitive complaints, especially regarding attention and memory.ObjectiveTo perform a systematic review of the studies available on cognitive evaluation in patients with migraine.MethodsWe evaluated all articles containing the key words: ""Migraine"", ""Cognition"" and ""Cognitive Impairment.""ResultsThe search strategy resulted in 23 articles. Fifteen out of the 23 studies (65.3%) retrieved reported abnormalities on neuropsychological tests in migraine patients, notably tests of memory, attention and information processing speed. Most of the studies showing cognitive changes in migraine were carried out in neurological care facilities. Conversely, among community-based studies, migraine patients were less likely to present cognitive changes.ConclusionPatients with migraine, especially those followed at neurology clinics, show an elevated risk of mild changes in several cognitive domains. Further studies with greater methodological refinement are warranted in order to clearly establish whether this cognitive dysfunction is associated with an underlying migraine pathophysiological process.",systematic_review

Abstract: ObjectiveHigh prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) was observed in patients with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). However, it is still unknown whether CP/CPPS is a risk factor of ED. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between CP/CPPS and ED.MethodsPubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane library were searched up to November 2014 to identify literatures that reported the association between CP/CPPS and ED. Case-control, cohort or cross-sectional studies were included. Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment scale was used in assessing qualities of included case-control and cohort studies and an eleven item quality assessment table was used in cross-sectional studies. This meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Odds ratio of ED and mean difference of 5-item International Index of Erectile Function scores were pooled across studies and analyzed using random effect model.ResultsA total of 3 cross-sectional studies, 2 case-control studies and 4 retrospective studies with 31,956 participants were included to calculate pooled OR of ED, and 2 studies for pooled mean difference of IIEF-5 score. A strong correlation between CP/CPPS and ED (pooled OR: 3.02, 95% CI: 2.18-4.17, P<0.01) was found, with significant heterogeneity across studies (I2=65%, P<0.01). Also a significant decrease of IIFE-5 score in CP/CPPS group (pooled MD: –4.54, 95% CI: –5.11-–3.98, P<0.01) was observed.ConclusionsPatients with CP/CPPS have a more increased risk of suffering from ED, but the mechanisms were unclear. Evidence of higher level is needed to further confirm this relationship.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundNausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) and hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) have a significant impact on quality of life. Medication to relieve symptoms of NVP and HG are available but pregnant women and their caregivers have been concerned about the teratogenic effect, side effects and poor efficacy. The aim of this review was to investigate if there is any clinical evidence for the efficacy of acustimulation in the treatment of NVP or HG.MethodsA systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including both English and Chinese databases was conducted to assess the efficacy of various techniques of acustimulation for NVP and HG. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane’s risks of bias tool. Revised STRICTA (2010) criteria were used to appraise acustimulation procedures. Pooled relative risks (RRp) and standard mean deviations (SMD) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from the data provided by the investigators of the original trials.ResultsTwenty-nine trials including 3519 patients met the inclusion criteria. Twenty trials could be included in statistical pooling. The overall effect of different acustimulation techniques shows a significant reduction for the combined outcome for NVP or HG in pregnancy as a dichotomous variable (RRp 1.73, 95 % CI 1.43 to 2.08). Studies with continuous outcome measures for nausea, vomiting and the combined outcome did not show any evidence for relieving symptoms of NVP and HG (SMD −0.12, 95 % CI −0.35 to 0.12).ConclusionsAlthough there is some evidence for an effect of acustimulation on nausea and vomiting or hyperemesis in pregnancy, results are not conclusive.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundNausea and vomiting (NV) is the most common health condition experienced by up to 80% of pregnant women. Although nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) is a natural condition and self-limiting, it has many negative impacts on the women’s overall health particularly quality of life (QoL). However, there is no summarized evidence that provides comprehensive information about the impact of NVP on health-related quality of life (HRQoL).ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to summarize the available empirical evidence on the impact of NV on QoL during pregnancy.MethodsFive electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, MIDIRS, PsycINFO, Web of Science) were searched using keywords and index terms identified in the first step. All databases were searched for studies published in English from January 2010 to February 2025. Studies were included if they assessed the impact of NVP on QoL among pregnant women. The National Institute of Health (NIH) quality assessment tool was used for risk of bias and quality assessment. The overall quality of the evidence was rated based on the GRADE approach.Results and DiscussionFollowing screening against the inclusion and exclusion criteria nine full-text studies were included for final analysis. In most studies pregnant women with NVP had significantly lower quality of life scores in most domains of the QoL components including, MCS and PCS of SF-36 and SF-12 and the NVPQoL compared with women without NVP. The increasing severity of NV was significantly correlated with poor QoL among pregnant women particularly in their first trimester as reported in most of the studies.ConclusionsNVP significantly affects QoL in pregnant women.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundDespite the presence of a plethora of publications on the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) only little is known how to treat established symptoms. Besides the high effort of performing these efficacy trials (much more patients must give their consent than are actually included in a study) and ethical concerns, little is known about the rate of re-occurring PONV/vomiting after placebo. As a consequence investigators will have difficulties defining a clinically relevant effect for the new treatment which is crucial for any planning. A quantitative systematic review was performed in order to provide more reliable estimates of the incidence of re-occurring PONV/vomiting after placebo and to help investigators defining a clinically relevant treatment effect.MethodsA systematic search of the literature was performed using an extended search strategy of a previous review. Data on the recurrence of PONV (any nausea or emetic symptom) and vomiting (retching or vomiting) was extracted from published reports treating PONV with placebo and unpublished results from two observational trials where no treatment was given. A nonlinear random effects model was used to calculate estimates of the recurrence of symptoms and their 95%-confidence intervals (95%-CI).ResultsA total of 29 trials (including the unpublished data) were eligible for the calculations.",systematic_review

Abstract: Nausea and vomiting are distressing symptoms for patients receiving chemotherapy. Moxibustion, which involves the use of burning moxa to generate heat and stimulate acupoints, has been reported to potentially ameliorate chemotherapy-induced side effects, particularly nausea and vomiting. This systematic review evaluated current evidence on the effectiveness of moxibustion against chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). We searched eight online databases and two trial registries for relevant trials. The random-effects model was used to conduct a meta-analysis. Furthermore, the risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) were used to explain dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively; the outcomes were within 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The results revealed that moxibustion might more favorably relieve the severity and frequency of CINV, compared with no treatment (RR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.42–2.93); moxibustion might have stronger effects than antiemetic drugs (RR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.27–2.76). There is no robust result that moxibustion could enhance the effects of antiemetic drugs administered as a complementary treatment. Actual moxibustion (8.10 ± 10.98) may have more favorable effects than placebo moxibustion (46.67 ± 23.32). However, the evidence obtained is not sufficient because of the lack of strict clinical trials. Protocol Registration. This trial is registered with PROSPERO CRD42016030037.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundPostoperative nausea and vomiting is a distressing complication of surgery, and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are often prescribed to prevent it. Ondansetron is the agent typically administered to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting. Although ramosetron has a longer duration of action than ondansetron, it remains unclear whether ramosetron is the more effective medication. We performed an updated meta-analysis on the comparative efficacy of ramosetron and ondansetron in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting.MethodsWe searched six databases for all trials that randomly assigned patients to ramosetron or ondansetron groups. The primary outcome was postoperative nausea or vomiting in the early, late, and next-day periods. The secondary outcomes were side effects of the medications. We used the random-effects model to combine the results. Trial sequential analyses were performed to correct for repetitive testing in the updated meta-analysis.ResultsTwenty-seven randomized controlled trials with 3,811 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The combined results of ramosetron vs. ondansetron efficacy in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting were as follows: Risk ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.82 [0.69–0.98] for early postoperative nausea, 0.76 [0.65–0.89] for late postoperative nausea, 0.69 [0.57–0.84] for next-day postoperative nausea, 0.78 [0.63–0.98] for early postoperative vomiting, 0.57 [0.45–0.72] for late postoperative vomiting, and 0.61 [0.43–0.86] for next-day postoperative vomiting.

Abstract: BackgroundAcupuncture therapy for preventive and treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting(PONV), a condition which commonly present after anaesthesia and surgery is a subject of growing interest. ObjectiveThis paper included a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effect of different type of acupuncture and acupoint selection in PONV prevention and treatment. MethodsRandomised controlled trials(RCTs) comparing acupuncture with non-acupuncture treatment were identified from databases PubMed, Cochrane, EBSCO, Ovid, CNKI and Wanfangdata. Meta-analysis on eligible studies was performed using fixed-effects model with RevMan 5.2. Results were expressed as RR for dichotomous data, with 95%CI. ResultsThirty RCTs, 1276 patients (intervention) and 1258 patients (control) were identified. Meta-analysis showed that PC6 acupuncture significantly reduced the number of cases of early vomiting (postoperative 0-6h) (RR=0.36, 95%CI 0.19,0.71; P=0.003) and nausea (postoperative 0-24h) (RR=0.25, 95%CI 0.10,0.61; P=0.002), but not early nausea (postoperative 0-6h) (RR=0.64, 95%CI 0.34,1.19; P=0.150) and vomiting (postoperative 0-24h) (RR=0.82, 95%CI 0.48,1.38; P=0.450).

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Nausea and vomiting (NV) are common and distressing adverse effects among cancer patients undergoing treatment. Despite the widespread use of pharmacological antiemetics, these medications are often insufficient for controlling nausea and may cause medication interactions and side effects. Acupuncture has been proposed as a complementary therapy; however, the comprehensive analysis of its effects on NV across all emetogenic cancer treatments remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in managing NV in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery. Materials and Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search across three electronic databases and two clinical registry platforms from inception to December 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating acupuncture for NV in cancer patients were included. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Safety outcomes were assessed based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Results: Seventeen RCTs met the inclusion criteria, with twelve studies included in the meta-analysis. Acupuncture did not demonstrate significant effects on acute nausea (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.84–1.15; p = 0.80) or acute vomiting (RR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.65–1.32; p = 0.67). However, it significantly reduced delayed vomiting (RR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.61–0.95; p = 0.02). Subgroup analysis demonstrated significant effects when acupuncture was administered for at least five days (RR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.39–0.81; p = 0.002). The most frequently used acupoints were PC6, ST36, CV12, LI4, LR3, and ST25.",systematic_review

Conclusions: Acupuncture represents a safe and effective complementary therapy for managing delayed vomiting in cancer patients receiving emetogenic treatments. Clinicians can anticipate optimal benefits from at least five days of treatment, particularly using acupoints PC6, ST36, CV12, LI4, LR3, and ST25. Further high-quality studies are needed to establish standardized treatment regimens and explore its comprehensive effects on NV.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundTo investigate the association between nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP), including hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), and postpartum depression (PPD), and to identify predictive symptoms of PPD to improve preventive care and follow-up.MethodsA systematic search was conducted in six databases from inception to June 25, 2024, using predefined keywords and MeSH terms related to PPD and pregnancy-related vomiting.Eligible studies included original research articles examining the association between PPD and NVP (any duration or severity, including HG). Articles were restricted to English or French. Diagnostic criteria for NVP and PPD had to be clearly specified.The systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024508214). Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Two independent researchers conducted article screening, data extraction, and bias assessment.ResultsOut of 355 identified articles, 18 (mainly prospective and retrospective cohort studies) were included. Analysis revealed a significantly increased risk of PPD in women with NVP, ranging from adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of 1.54 [95% CI 1.42–1.68] for mild NVP to 6.52 [95% CI 3.76–11.30] for severe NVP and 2.26 [95% CI 1.04–4.92] for persistent symptoms. These values represent the lowest and highest aORs reported in individual studies, not a pooled meta-analytic estimate. The association remained significant in large-scale studies after adjusting for confounders.ConclusionsThis review highlights the importance of monitoring the severity and duration of NVP during pregnancy.",systematic_review

Abstract: PurposeDelayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) remains an important adverse effect of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy not containing anthracyclines and cyclophosphamide (non-AC MEC). In this review, we summarize current literature to update recommendations for delayed CINV prophylaxis after non-AC MEC.MethodsWe conducted a systematic search in PubMed and conference proceedings from ASCO, ESMO, and MASCC. Included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of two or more antiemetic strategies in the prevention of delayed CINV after the administration of non-AC MEC. At least one of the following endpoints was used: complete response, complete control, no nausea, no vomiting, and/or no use of rescue medication.ResultsOur search provided 247 publications. Nine met the predefined criteria. Included RCTs reported outcomes on palonosetron, aprepitant, casopitant, netupitant/palonosetron (NEPA), olanzapine, and megestrol acetate.ConclusionsSuperiority of palonosetron over first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists for the prevention of acute and delayed CINV after non-AC MEC has not been proven. The addition of an NK1 receptor antagonist to first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists does not significantly improve the incidence of delayed CINV after non-AC MEC. The efficacy of a single-day regimen of dexamethasone with palonosetron is non-inferior to multiday dexamethasone.",systematic_review

Abstract: AbstractBackground:Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a condition that commonly following anesthesia and surgery, antiemetics can lead to some side effects in treating PONV. Acupuncture PC6(Neiguan) has been widely used in the prevention and treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting. However, there still exists controversy towards its effectiveness, appropriate, and effective intervention time. We, therefore, design this meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness and confirm the optimal time of acupuncture PC6 point for PONV.Methods:The following electronic databases will be searched from their inception to April 2020, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, the Chongqing VIP Chinese Science, and Technology Periodical Database. All randomized controlled trials in English or Chinese involving acupuncture PC6 for patients with PONV will be included. Two reviewers will independently responsible for the data extraction, study selection, risk of bias assessment and assessment of study quality.

Abstract: BackgroundParents of febrile children frequently contact primary care. Longer duration of fever has been related to increased risk for serious bacterial infections (SBI). However, the evidence for this association remains controversial. We assessed the predictive value of duration of fever for SBI.MethodsStudies from MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases (from January 1991 to December 2009) were retrieved. We included studies describing children aged 2 months to 6 years in countries with high Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccination coverage. Duration of fever had to be studied as a predictor for serious bacterial infections.ResultsSeven studies assessed the association between duration of fever and serious bacterial infections; three of these found a relationship.ConclusionThe predictive value of duration of fever for identifying serious bacterial infections in children remains inconclusive. None of these seven studies was performed in primary care. Studies evaluating the duration of fever and its predictive value in children in primary care are required.",systematic_review

Abstract: Study Design Systematic review.Objective To determine the incidence, pathogenesis, and clinical outcomes related to neurogenic fevers following traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).Methods A systematic review of the literature was performed on thermodysregulation secondary to acute traumatic SCI in adult patients. A literature search was performed using PubMed (MEDLINE), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus. Using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, seven relevant articles were obtained.Results The incidence of fever of all origins (both known and unknown) after SCI ranged from 22.5 to 71.7% with a mean incidence of 50.6% and a median incidence of 50.0%. The incidence of fever of unknown origin (neurogenic fever) ranged from 2.6 to 27.8% with a mean incidence of 8.0% and a median incidence of 4.7%. Cervical and thoracic spinal injuries were more commonly associated with fever than lumbar injuries. In addition, complete injuries had a higher incidence of fever than incomplete injuries. The pathogenesis of neurogenic fever after acute SCI is not thoroughly understood.Conclusion Neurogenic fevers are relatively common following an acute SCI; however, there is little in the scientific literature to help physicians prevent or treat this condition. The paucity of research underscored by this review demonstrates the need for further studies with larger sample sizes, focusing on incidence rate, clinical outcomes, and pathogenesis of neurogenic fever following acute traumatic SCI.",systematic_review

Abstract: SummaryBackgroundThe recent Ebola epidemic has increased public awareness of the risk of travel associated viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF). International preparedness to manage imported cases Ebola virus infection was inadequate, highlighted by cases of nosocomial transmission. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a re-emerging tick-borne VHF centred in the Eurasian region, affecting a large geographical area and with human-to-human transmission reported, especially in the healthcare setting.ObjectivesTo systematically review the characteristics of travel associated Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.MethodsA systematic review of travel-associated cases of CCHF was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement protocol. PubMed, SCOPUS, Science Citation Index (SCI) and ProMED databases were searched for reports published between January 1960 and January 2016. Three independent reviewers selected and reviewed studies and extracted data.Results21 cases of travel associated CCHF were identified, of which 12 died (3 outcome unknown) and 4 secondary (nosocomial) infections were reported. Risk occupations or activities for CCHF infection were reported in 8/12 cases when data were available. Travel from Asia to Asia occurred in 9 cases, Africa to Africa occurred in 5 cases, Africa to Europe in 3 cases, Asia to Europe in 2 cases and Europe to Europe in 2 cases.ConclusionCCHF related to travel is rare, is generally associated with at risk activities/occupation and is frequently fatal. Key to early diagnosis and prevention of nosocomial transmission is an understanding of CCHF risk factors and the geographical distribution of CCHF.",systematic_review

Abstract: IntroductionIn 5%–10% of patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), colchicine is not effective in preventing inflammatory attacks. Another 5%–10% of patients are intolerant to effective doses of colchicine and experience serious side effects. Treatment with anti-interleukin-1 (IL-1) drugs may be an alternative for these patients, although it is not reimbursed for this indication in many countries.MethodsWe systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for reports of anti-IL-1 treatment in FMF patients.ResultsOut of 284 potentially relevant articles, 27 eligible reports were identified and included in the data analysis.ConclusionA complete response to therapy without a single attack during treatment was reported in 76.5% of patients on anakinra treatment and in 67.5% of patients during canakinumab treatment. In patients with established type AA amyloidosis, anti-IL-1 treatment can reverse proteinuria.

Abstract: BackgroundThere is a significant global health burden associated with acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD), especially in developing countries. ARF and RHD most often strike children and young adults living in impoverished settings, where unhygienic conditions and lack of awareness and knowledge of streptococcal infection progression are common. Secondary prophylactic measures have been recommended in the past, but primary prevention measures have been gaining more attention from researchers frustrated by the perpetual prevalence of ARF and RHD in developing countries. Health education aims to empower people to take responsibility for their own well-being by gaining control over the underlying factors that influence health. We therefore conducted a review of the current best evidence for the use of health education interventions to increase awareness and knowledge of streptococcal pharyngitis and ARF.Methods and designThis article describes the protocol for a systematic review of the effectiveness of health education interventions aimed at increasing awareness and knowledge of the symptoms, causes and consequences of streptococcal pharyngitis, rheumatic fever and/or rheumatic heart disease. Studies will be selected in which the effect of an intervention is compared with either a pre-intervention or a control, targeting all possible audience types.

Abstract: BackgroundDengue fever in renal transplanted patients has not been studied well, and we review all the literature about episodes dengue fever in renal transplant patients.MethodsThe aim was to describe clinico-pathological characteristics, immunosuppressive protocols, need renal outcome and mortality. PubMed, LILACS, Google Scholar and Research Gate were searched for “Dengue” and “Renal/Kidney Transplantation” with no date limits. Hits were analyzed by two researchers separately.ResultsFever, myalgia, arthralgia and headache was significantly lower than normal population, while pleural effusions and ascites were observed more. Incidence of severe dengue is significantly higher among transplant patients in this review, as well as they had a significantly higher mortality (8.9% vs 3.7%, p = 0.031). Age, period after transplantation and immunosuppressive profile had no effect on disease severity, mortality or graft out come. Presence of new bleeding complications and ascites was associated with more severe disease (p < 0.001 and p = 0.005), death (p = 0.033) or graft loss (p = 0.035). Use of tacrolimus was associated with new bleeding complications (p = 0.027), and with ascites (p = 0.021), but not with thrombocytopenia. 25% of patients with primary disease fail to mount an IgG response by 15 weeks of the illness. 58.9% had graft dysfunction during illness. Postoperative transplanted patients were at risk of severe disease and unfavorable outcome.ConclusionsThe physical and laboratory findings in dengue fever in renal transplanted patients differ from the general population.

Abstract: BackgroundAcute rheumatic fever is considered to be a heritable condition, but the magnitude of the genetic effect is unknown. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of twin studies of concordance of acute rheumatic fever in order to derive quantitative estimates of the size of the genetic effect.MethodsWe searched PubMed/MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, EMBASE, and Google Scholar from their inception to 31 January 2011, and bibliographies of retrieved articles, for twin studies of the concordance for acute rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease in monozygotic versus dizygotic twins that used accepted diagnostic criteria for acute rheumatic fever and zygosity without age, gender or language restrictions. Twin similarity was measured by probandwise concordance rate and odds ratio (OR), and aggregate probandwise concordance risk was calculated by combining raw data from each study. ORs from separate studies were combined by random-effects meta-analysis to evaluate association between zygosity status and concordance. Heritability was estimated by fitting a variance components model to the data.Results435 twin pairs from six independent studies met the inclusion criteria. The pooled probandwise concordance risk for acute rheumatic fever was 44% in monozygotic twins and 12% in dizygotic twins, and the association between zygosity and concordance was strong (OR 6.39; 95% confidence interval, 3.39 to 12.06; P<0.001), with no significant study heterogeneity (P = 0.768).

Abstract: Aim To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to establish if fever is associated with primary tooth eruption.Materials and methods Literature searches involved Pubmed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane. The potentially relevant studies had the full text analyzed. Only studies concerning fever during eruption period of primary tooth in humans were included. Papers in non-English language, and papers that included syndromic patients or patients with any disease were excluded. The meta-analyses were performed with Review Manager (version 5.3). Only studies that reported the results as dichotomous data were analyzed with Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test in meta-analysis function of Review Manager 5.3. The fixed-effects model was used to evaluate the association between tooth eruption and fever.Results Search identified 83 potential studies. After exclusion of the duplicated studies, or were not related to the criteria of inclusion only 6 studies were selected for the systematic review. In the overall meta-analysis, no association was found [OR = 1.32 (0.88-1.96)] between fever and primary tooth eruption. However, in the subgroup analysis, when the method used to measure fever was the rectal temperature there was an association [OR = 2.82 (1.55-5.14)] between fever and primary tooth eruption.Conclusion There are few suitable studies in the literature regarding the association between primary tooth eruption and fever.

Abstract: Background:Optimal delivery of regular benzathine penicillin G (BPG) injections pre-scribed as secondary prophylaxis for acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is vital to preventing disease morbidity and cardiac sequelae in affected pediatric and young adult popu-lations. However, poor uptake of secondary prophylaxis remains a significant challenge to ARF/RHD control programs.Objective:In order to facilitate better understanding of this challenge and thereby identify means to improve service delivery, this systematic literature review explored rates of adherence and factors asso-ciated with adherence to secondary prophylaxis for ARF and RHD worldwide.Methods:MEDLINE was searched for relevant primary studies published in the English language from 1994-2014, and a search of reference lists of eligible articles was performed. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using a modified assessment tool.Results:Twenty studies were included in the review. There was a range of adherence to varying regi-mens of secondary prophylaxis reported globally, and a number of patient demographic, clinical, socio-cultural and health care service delivery factors associated with adherence to secondary prophylaxis were identified.Conclusion:Insights into factors associated with lower and higher adherence to secondary prophylaxis may be utilized to facilitate improved delivery of secondary prophylaxis for ARF and RHD. Strategies may include ensuring an effective active recall system, providing holistic care, involving community health workers and delivering ARF/RHD health education.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundMany parents consider fever a disease in itself and feel disempowered when their child is ill. Numerous guidelines have been produced; however, their target audience remains healthcare professionals and not carers of children in general. A reliable source of information will decrease worry in parents and carers when managing a febrile child.Methods/DesignA systematic search will be conducted in nine electronic databases. Articles published in English, or with an abstract published in English, will be eligible for inclusion in the review. Unpublished literature, grey literature and consultation with experts in the area will be used to supplement database searching. Titles and abstracts of studies will be screened for inclusion in the study by two independent reviewers against pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A data extraction form will be designed and data will be extracted to provide detail of the included studies by a further two reviewers. Quality assessment of studies will be conducted by two additional independent reviewers and results will be used to moderate included studies. All disagreements will be resolved through discussion until consensus is reached. Thematic synthesis will be used to analyse results.DiscussionCorrect management of fever in children is not well understood in the general population. Although carers can identify fever and febrile illness in children, determination of the severity of fever proves challenging. Research is needed to cohere existing evidence and identify knowledge gaps.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundPostoperative cough is a prevalent complication in lung resection patients, exacerbating postoperative pain, impairing sleep and communication, and thereby reducing overall quality of life. Early identification of high-risk patients and targeted preventive measures are essential to reduce cough frequency, alleviate symptoms, facilitate recovery, and enhance quality of life. This study aimed to develop a predictive model to identify patients at risk of persistent cough following pulmonary resection.MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to identify risk factors associated with persistent cough after pulmonary resection. In the predictive model, the natural logarithm of the pooled risk estimate for each factor was used as a coefficient to assign risk prediction scores. Data from 294 patients who underwent pulmonary resection between October and December 2024 were used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the model.ResultsThe meta-analysis included 13 studies with 3,669 patients who underwent pulmonary resection, of whom 1,115 developed postoperative chronic cough. Seven significant predictors of persistent cough were identified: lobectomy, right-sided surgery, right upper lobectomy, subcarinal lymph node dissection, lymph node dissection around the bronchial tree, tracheal intubation time (≥172 min), and postoperative acid reflux. The model was validated using logistic regression analysis with an external cohort, yielding an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 (95% confidence interval: 0.82–0.91).",systematic_review

Abstract: Coughing is one of the most prevalent symptoms in children presenting at outpatient departments. This systematic review aimed to review previous literature in order to compare the use of honey and antitussive medications for treating coughs in children. Literature was screened across five databases using Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) strategy, keywords, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. The remaining literature was evaluated using a quality appraisal tool checklist. This review includes systematic reviews, ‎‎meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, cross-sectional studies, and articles ‎without ‎a defined ‎methodology section. This review suggests that honey is effective in treating children above 12 months of age, while cold and cough medications (CCMs) are safe if administered at therapeutic doses. Since fatalities can occur in children under two years of age, further RCT studies on CCMs are required to establish safety across all age groups.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundChronic cough is a common reason for medical referral and its prevalence is on the rise. With only one pharmaceutical therapy currently under review for the treatment of refractory chronic cough, exploring non-pharmacological chronic cough management therapies is important. This systematic review summarizes the effectiveness of non-pharmacological chronic cough therapies in adults with non-productive refractory chronic cough or cough due to chronic respiratory diseases.MethodsWe searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Scopus from inception to September 2021. Randomized controlled trials published in English, Portuguese, or French, and examining the effects of non-pharmacological therapies in adults with chronic non-productive cough (>8 weeks; <2 teaspoons sputum) were included. Mean differences, medians, and odds ratios were calculated as appropriate.Results16,546 articles were identified and six articles representing five unique studies were included. Studies evaluated 228 individuals with refractory chronic cough or chronic cough due to a chronic respiratory disease [162 women (71%); 52 ± 11 to 61 ± 8 years old]. Obstructive sleep apnea was the only chronic respiratory disease studied.

Abstract: AbstractStudies have shown that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are superior in primary and secondary prevention for cardiac mortality and morbidity to angiotensin receptor blocker (ARBs). One of the common side effects from ACEI is dry cough. The aims of this systematic review, and network meta‐analysis are to rank the risk of cough induced by different ACEIs and between ACEI and placebo, ARB or calcium channel blockers (CCB). We performed a systematic review, and network meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials to rank the risk of cough induced by each ACEI and between ACEI and placebo, ARB or CCB. A total of 135 RCTs with 45,420 patients treated with eleven ACEIs were included in the analyses. The pooled estimated relative risk (RR) between ACEI and placebo was 2.21 (95% CI: 2.05–2.39). ACEI had more incidences of cough than ARB (RR 3.2; 95% CI: 2.91, 3.51), and pooled estimated of RR between ACEI and CCB was 5.30 (95% CI: 4.32–6.50) Moexipril ranked as number one for inducing cough (SUCRA 80.4%) and spirapril ranked the least (SUCRA 12.3%). The order for the rest of the ACEIs are as follows: ramipril (SUCRA 76.4%), fosinopril (SUCRA 72.5%), lisinopril (SUCRA 64.7%), benazepril (SUCRA 58.6%), quinapril (SUCRA 56.5%), perindopril (SUCRA 54.1%), enalapril (SUCRA 49.7%), trandolapril (SUCRA 44.6%) and, captopril (SUCRA 13.7%). All ACEI has the similar risk of developing a cough. ACEI should be avoided in patients who have risk of developing cough, and an ARB or CCB is an alternative based on the patient's comorbidity.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundPostoperative cough (POC) is a common complication following pulmonary resection, with an incidence of 25–50%. However, it often receives insufficient attention from clinicians. This study aimed to systematically identify the key risk factors associated with POC in lung cancer survivors and to develop and validate a predictive model to assess the likelihood of POC following pulmonary resection.MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted by searching PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, WANFANG DATA, and CNKI to identify relevant risk factors for POC. Additionally, a cohort of 5,570 patients who underwent pulmonary resection was used to develop and validate the predictive model. Statistically significant independent variables from the meta-analysis were incorporated into the model, with risk factors weighted based on their pooled odds ratios (ORs) and β-coefficients. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA).ResultsThe meta-analysis included 23 cohorts with 5,360 patients, of whom 33.8% experienced POC. Significant risk factors identified were age ≥60 years, body mass index (BMI) <24 kg/m2, preoperative cough, right lung surgery, lobectomy, subcarinal and peritracheal lymph node dissection, postoperative acid reflux, and preoperative respiratory training. The predictive model demonstrated robust performance, with AUCs of 0.772 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.757–0.786] in the training cohort and 0.782 (95% CI: 0.761–0.803) in the validation cohort.",systematic_review

Abstract: IntroductionValidated and reliable patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are recommended to assess the severity and impact of cough in interstitial lung disease (ILD). We systematically reviewed the literature to identify PROMs for cough in ILD, examining their psychometric properties.MethodsWe searched four databases from inception to 10 January 2025. English-language original articles that described the use of a PROM to measure cough in adults with ILD and addressed the psychometric properties, method of administration or results of usability testing were selected.Results21 PROMs were evaluated in 35 studies, including 14 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and seven in other ILDs, eight cough-specific PROMs, and 13 disease-specific PROMs with a domain for cough. No tool had sufficient evidence for more than 5/7 of the psychometric properties evaluated. There was evidence for content validity for four PROMs in IPF (A Tool to Assess Quality of Life in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (ATAQ-IPF), the Cough and Sputum Assessment Questionnaire (CASA-Q), Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms: COPD (E-RS™:COPD) and the Living with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Questionnaire (L-IPF)). Only one study evaluated convergent validity using objective cough monitoring, demonstrating high validity for the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) (r=−0.74– −0.80) and cough visual analogue scale (VAS) (r=0.80).

Abstract: IntroductionAzithromycin is an effective treatment for various respiratory conditions but its effect on cough is poorly understood. We synthesised data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and noncomparative studies (NCT) examining its effect on objective and subjective cough.MethodsAfter prospective registration on PROSPERO, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL for both RCTs and NCT trials examining the effect azithromycin on cough in respiratory disease.ResultsWe identified 1240 studies of which 6 (4 RCTs and 2 NCT studies) were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of 275 patients. Azithromycin was associated with significant improvement in Leicester Cough Questionnaire scores at follow-up when compared to baseline scores (SMD = 0.62 [95% CI 0.12 to 1.12], p = 0.01). However, when only RCTs were synthesised, no significant effect was observed (SMD = 0.12 [95% CI − 0.36 to 0.60], p = 0.62). There was no significant reduction in cough severity VAS score (SMD = − 0.39 [95% CI − 0.92 to 0.14], p = 0.15). There was no significant reduction in objective cough count (SMD = − 0.41 [95% CI − 1.04 to 0.32], p = 0.09).ConclusionAzithromycin therapy improves cough-related quality of life in various chronic respiratory diseases; however, there was no significant effect on cough outcomes when only data from RCTs were synthesised.",systematic_review

Abstract: PurposeRecent evidence suggests a global burden of chronic cough in general populations. However, the definitions vary greatly among epidemiological studies, and none have been validated for clinical relevance. We aimed to examine previous epidemiological definitions in detail and explore the operational characteristics.MethodsA systematic review was conducted for epidemiological surveys that reported the prevalence of chronic cough in general adult populations during the years 1980 to 2013. A literature search was performed on Pubmed and Embase without language restriction. Epidemiological definitions for chronic cough were classified according to their components, such as cutoff duration. Meta-analyses were performed for the male-to-female ratio of chronic cough prevalence to explore operational characteristics of epidemiological definitions.ResultsA total of 70 studies were included in the systematic review. The most common epidemiological definition was identified as 'cough ≥3 months' duration without specification of phlegm (n=50); however, it conflicted with the cutoff duration in current clinical guidelines (cough ≥8 weeks). Meta-analyses were performed for the male-to-female ratio of chronic cough among 28 studies that reported sex-specific prevalence using the most common definition. The pooled male-to-female odds ratio was 1.26 (95% confidence interval 0.92-1.73) with significant heterogeneity (I2=96%, P<0.001), which was in contrast to clinical observations of female predominance from specialist clinics.

Abstract: SummaryBackgroundRefractory chronic cough (RCC) has a significant impact on patient’s health-related quality of life and represents a challenge in clinical management. However, the optimal treatment for RCC remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate and compare the efficacy and safety of the current pharmacological therapeutic options for RCC.MethodsA systematic review was performed by searching PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Ovid databases from January 1, 2008 to March 1, 2023. All randomised control trials (RCTs) reporting outcomes of efficacy or/and safety were included in the Bayesian network meta-analysis. Here, we compared the effects on Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and objective cough frequency of patients with RCC. Besides, we also compared the incidence of adverse events (AEs) for analysis of safety. PROSPERO registration: CRD42022345940.Findings19 eligible RCTs included 3326 patients and 7 medication categories: P2X3 antagonist, GABA modulator, Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) modulator, NK-1 agonist, opioid analgesic, macrolide, and sodium cromoglicate. Compared with placebo, mean difference (MD) of LCQ and 24 h cough frequency for P2X3 antagonist relief were 1.637 (95% CI: 0.887–2.387) and −11.042 (P = 0.035). Compared with placebo, effect sizes (MD for LCQ and cough severity VAS) for GABA modulator were 1.347 (P = 0.003) and −7.843 (P = 0.003). In the network meta-analysis, gefapixant is the most effective treatment for patients with RCC (The Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curves (SUCRA) is 0.711 in LCQ, 0.983 in 24 h cough frequency, and 0.786 in cough severity VAS).

Eliapixant and lesogaberan had better efficacy than placebo in cough severity VAS. However, TRP modulator had worse efficacy than placebo. In the meta-analysis of AEs, the present study found P2X3 antagonist had a significant correlation to AEs (RR: 1.129, 95% CI: 1.012–1.259), especially taste-related AEs (RR: 6.216, P < 0.05).InterpretationIn this network meta-analysis, P2X3 antagonist showing advantages in terms of efficacy is currently the most promising medication for treatment of RCC. GABA modulator also showed potential efficacy for RCC but with AEs of the central system. Nevertheless, the role of TRP modulator needed to be revisited.

Abstract: ObjectivesTo systematically review the effects of dezocine (DZC) on the occurrence rate and severity of opioid-induced cough (OIC).DesignSystematic review and meta-analysisData sourcesPubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Ovid, Web of Science as well as Chinese BioMedical Literature & Retrieval System, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang and VIP Data were searched from 1978 to 31 December 2020.Inclusion criteriaAll randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing DZC with placebo on the occurrence rate and severity of OIC.Data analysisAll data were analysed by using RevMan V.5.3. Each outcome was tested for heterogeneity, and randomised-effects or fixed-effects model was used in the presence or absence of significant heterogeneity.ResultsOur search yielded 33 RCTs including 4442 patients, and 2521 patients were allocated into the DZC group and 1921 into the control group. Fentanyl was administrated in 1880 patients and sufentanil in 2562 patients during the induction of general anaesthesia. The meta-analysis demonstrated that DZC significantly reduced the occurrence rate of OIC induced by either fentanyl (8.8% vs 49.7%, OR=0.07, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.12, p<0.00001) or sufentanil (5.0% vs 41.5%, OR=0.07, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.12, p<0.00001). The meta-analysis also indicated that the occurrence rate of mild, moderate and severe OIC in the DZC group was remarkably lower than that of the control group (mild: 3.6% vs 13.6%, OR=0.19, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.25, p<0.00001; moderate: 2.0% vs 13.6%, OR=0.12, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.18, p<0.00001; severe: 1.0% vs 13.9%, OR=0.08, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.12, p<0.00001).",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundThe extent to which objective and subjective tools has been used to measure the characteristics and burden of cough in patients with asthma has not been reported.ObjectiveTo review the large and extensive body of literature in asthma with the specific hypothesis that the characteristics of cough and clinical impact in this disease has only occasionally been studied.MethodsFor this systematic review, we searched EMBASE and MEDLINE databases using a combination of MeSH terms for “cough” and “asthma” for studies published up to and including end of August 2021. Studies included for analysis were confined to those undertaken in adult patients (≥ 18 years) with asthma of any severity where any tool or method to specifically measure cough was employed.ResultsOf 12,090 citations identified after our initial search, 112 full-text articles met criteria for inclusion in our analysis. We found that a broad range of objective and subjective measures have been used albeit with a lack of consistency between studies. Clinically important levels of cough associated with impaired health status were identified in patients with asthma.ConclusionAlthough cough is a common symptom in asthma, the clinical features and accompanying healthcare burden have been studied infrequently. In studies where cough was measured, the methods employed varied considerably. A more consistent use of cough-specific measurement tools is required to better determine the nature and burden of cough in asthma.",systematic_review

Abstract: Chinese herbal medicine has been commonly used in the treatment of postinfectious cough. The aim of this review is to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine for postinfectious cough. An extensive search for RCTs was performed using multiple electronic databases, supplemented with a manual search. All studies included were confirmed with specific inclusion criteria. Methodological quality of each study was examined according to the Cochrane risk of bias assessment. Quality of evidence was evaluated using rating approach developed by GRADE working group. The literature search yielded 352 results, of which 12 RCTs satisfied the inclusion criteria, offering moderate-to-high levels of evidence. Methodological quality was considered high in three trials, while in the other nine studies the unclear risk of bias was in the majority. Findings suggested that, compared with western conventional medicine or placebo, Chinese herbal medicine could effectively improve core symptoms of postinfectious cough, act better and have earlier antitussive effect, and enhance patients' quality of life.

Abstract: AbstractObjectivesCough occurring in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) was first described in 1935 and is a frequently discussed symptom on patient forums. We aimed to systematically review the available evidence to explore the prevalence and risk factors for persistent cough in patients diagnosed with RCC to establish whether cough could be a presenting symptom of RCC.DesignThis epidemiological systematic review used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement 2020.Data sourcesMedline, Embase, Science Citation Index, The Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO trials register were searched without language restrictions until 1 June 2023.Eligibility criteria for selecting studiesWe included articles of all study designs reporting cough in patients (18 years or older) with RCC attributed to the disease itself or to treatment.Data extraction and synthesisData from included articles was extracted using a preprepared and piloted form, and quality assessment was conducted independently by two authors. The risk of bias was assessed in studies other than case reports or case series using the critical appraisal instrument for studies reporting prevalence data. Narrative techniques were used for data analysis and, where appropriate, meta-analysis using a fixed-effects model was performed.ResultsOf 509 studies screened, 105 full-text articles were assessed, with 46 papers subsequently excluded, resulting in 59 analysed in depth. There were 105 patients with RCC reported as having a cough due to the disease itself within 30 case reports and 8 case series.

Abstract: BackgroundOpioid-induced cough (OIC) is a common side effect during anesthetic induction. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ketamine/esketamine in preventing OIC during anesthetic induction.MethodsWe systematically searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from inception through December 2024 for randomized controlled trials that examined the efficacy of ketamine/esketamine in preventing OIC (Registration: INPLASY2024120102). Studies were included if they: (1) evaluated surgical patients receiving short-acting opioids (e.g., fentanyl) during anesthetic induction; (2) compared ketamine or esketamine against placebo/no treatment; and (3) reported OIC incidence. Studies were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed using risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The primary outcome was the overall incidence of OIC within 3 min after opioids administration.ResultsTwelve trials involving ketamine (nine trials) and esketamine (three trials) were analyzed. Notably, both agents significantly reduced the overall incidence of OIC compared to placebo (RR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.22–0.41; p < 0.00001, I2 = 61%, moderate certainty). All studies demonstrated low risk of bias across all domains for primary outcome. These agents also demonstrated efficacy against mild cough (RR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.28–0.59, high certainty) and moderate-to-severe cough (RR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.18–0.38, moderate certainty).",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundThe role of objective cough monitoring systems for assessments in adults with chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) is unclear. This systematic review aimed to synthesise current literature on frequency of use and characteristics of these systems.MethodsMEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL were systematically searched to identify relevant literature evaluating cough in adults with CRDs using objective cough monitoring systems. The primary outcomes were utility and characteristics of the systems, with the secondary outcome being usability.ResultsWe identified 54 primary studies (4909 patients, with 3364 having idiopathic chronic cough). Included studies were generally of low risk of bias. Objective monitoring systems identified were VitaloJAK (n=19 studies), Leicester Cough Monitor (LCM, n=18), LEOSound (n=2), PulmoTrack (n=2), Hull Automated Cough Counter (HACC, n=1), LifeShirt (n=1), and unnamed devices (n=11). There was limited assessment against manual counting, with low-to-moderate correlation to patient-reported outcome measures for VitaloJAK (p<0.05), LCM (r=0.43–0.78) and unnamed devices (r=0.38–0.40). Test–retest consistency was evaluated in two studies, showing favourable results. There was at least moderate effect size of longitudinal measurement changes to various treatments for VitaloJAK (nine out of 16), LCM (two out of eight), HACC (n=1), LCM and HACC (n=1), PulmoTrack (n=1) and unnamed devices (n=3).ConclusionsFew studies evaluated the agreement of objective cough monitoring systems against manual counting.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatments are often prescribed based on individuals' pattern diagnoses. A systematic review of Chinese and English literatures on TCM pattern differentiation, treatment principle, and pattern-based treatment for insomnia has therefore been conducted. A total of 227 studies, 17916 subjects, and 87 TCM patterns were analyzed. There was a limited consistency in pattern-based TCM treatment of insomnia across practitioners. Except for Gui Pi Tang, An Shen Ding Zhi Wan, and Wen Dan Tang which were used more commonly for deficiency of both the heart and spleen, internal disturbance of phlegm-heat, and qi deficiency of the heart and gallbladder, respectively, the selection of herbal formula for other patterns and pattern-based prescription of individual herbs and acupoints were not consistent. Suanzaoren (Semen Z. spinosae), Fuling (Poria), Yejiaoteng (Caulis P. multiflori), Gancao (Radix Glycyrrhizae), Baishao (Radix P. alba), Shenmen (HT7), Yintang (EX-HN3), Sanyinjiao (SP6), Baihui (GV20), Anmian (EX-HN22), and Sishencong (EX-HN1) were commonly used, but nonspecifically for many patterns. Treatment principles underlying herb and acupoint selection were seldom reported. Although many studies were reviewed, the study quality and diagnostic process were inadequate. More high quality studies are needed to examine the additional benefits of pattern differentiation and pattern-based TCM treatment.",systematic_review

Abstract: Aim:This sudy aims to investigate the association between insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Methods:We searched published studies indexed in MEDLINE and EMBASE database from inception to December 2015. Studies that reported odds ratios (ORs), risk ratios, hazard ratios or standardized incidence ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI) comparing the risk of NAFLD among participants who had insomnia or EDS versus those without insomnia or EDS were included. Pooled ORs and 95% CI were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. Cochran's Q test and I2 statistic were used to determine the between-study heterogeneity.Results:Our search strategy yielded 2117 potentially relevant articles (781 articles from MEDLINE and 1336 articles from EMBASE). After comprehensive review, seven studies (three cross-sectional studies and four case–control studies) were found to be eligible and were included in the meta-analysis. The risk of NAFLD in participants who had insomnia was significantly higher with the pooled OR of 1.13 (95% CI, 1.00–1.27). The statistical heterogeneity was moderate with an I2 of 62%. Elevated risk of NAFLD was also observed among participants with EDS even though the 95% CI was wider and did not reach statistical significance (pooled OR 2.21; 95% CI, 0.84–5.82). The statistical heterogeneity was moderate with an I2 of 62%.Conclusions:Our study demonstrated an increased risk of NAFLD among participants who had insomnia or EDS.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included if acupuncture was compared to placebo or other conventional therapy for treatment of insomnia after stroke. Assessments were performed using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), the insomnia severity index (ISI), the Athens insomnia scale (AIS), and the efficacy standards of Chinese medicine.ResultsA total of 165 studies were identified; 13 RCTs met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that acupuncture appeared to be more effective than drugs for treatment of insomnia after stroke, as assessed by the PSQI (weighted mean difference, 4.31; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.67–6.95; P = 0.001) and by the efficacy standards of Chinese medicine (risk ratio, 1.25; 95 % CI, 1.12–1.40; P < 0.001).

Abstract: A systematic review was conducted to examine traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) patterns commonly diagnosed in subjects with insomnia and clinical features associated with the TCM patterns, and an insomnia symptom checklist for TCM diagnostic purpose was developed based on the review. Two independent researchers searched the China Academic Journals Full-Text Database and 10 English databases. A total of 103 studies and 9499 subjects were analyzed. There was a wide variation in terminology relating to symptomatology and TCM pattern. We identified 69 patterns, with the top 3 patterns (i.e., deficiency of both the heart and spleen, hyperactivity of fire due to yin deficiency, and liver-qi stagnation transforming into fire) and the top 10 patterns covering 51.8% and 77.4% of the 9499 subjects, respectively. There were 19 sleep-related, 92 non-sleep-related, 14 tongue, and 7 pulse features included as diagnostic criteria of the top 10 TCM patterns for insomnia. Excessive dreaming, dizziness, red tongue, and fine pulse were the most common sleep-related, non-sleep-related, tongue, and pulse features.

Abstract: Individuals with cancer are disproportionately affected by sleep disturbance and insomnia relative to the general population. These problems can be a consequence of the psychological, behavioral, and physical effects of a cancer diagnosis and treatment. Insomnia often persists for years and, when combined with already high levels of cancer-related distress, may place cancer survivors at a higher risk of future physical and mental health problems and poorer quality of life. The recommended first-line treatment for insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), a non-pharmacological treatment that incorporates cognitive and behavior-change techniques and targets dysfunctional attitudes, beliefs, and habits involving sleep. This article presents a comprehensive review of the literature examining the efficacy of CBT-I on sleep and psychological outcomes in cancer patients and survivors. The search revealed 12 studies (four uncontrolled, eight controlled) that evaluated the effects of CBT-I in cancer patients or survivors. Results suggest that CBT-I is associated with statistically and clinically significant improvements in subjective sleep outcomes in patients with cancer. CBT-I may also improve mood, fatigue, and overall quality of life, and can be successfully delivered through a variety of treatment modalities, making it possible to reach a broader range of patients who may not have access to more traditional programs. Future research in this area should focus on the translation of evidence into clinical practice in order to increase awareness and access to effective insomnia treatment in cancer care.",systematic_review

Abstract: Introduction Sleep related disorders affect around 30% of people all over the world, and evidence shows that 10% require therapeutic intervention. Insomnia represents the most common disturbance of sleep, defined as the experience of poor sleep for at least 1 month. Most of primary insomnia can be prevented by a proper lifestyle and sleep hygiene rules. Regardless, hypnotic drugs and widely prescribed, and most times, long-term used, which is not recommended because of its negative side effects.ObjectivesReview the scientific evidence about effectiveness of plant extracts for insomnia, natural products with practically no side-effects, and thus be possible to reduce or even avoid the use of hypnotic drugs.MethodsThe Medline database through the Pubmed search engine was used with the following keywords: “insomnia” and “herbal compounds”.ResultsValerian activity on sleep disturbances has been attributed to the presence of isovaleric acids and valepotriates with reported calming action and GABA reuptake inhibition with sedative effects. Considering the data presented in the literature, despite controversial and conflicting, several studies showed that valerian (160-600mg/day) improved sleep quality and reduced sleep latency and duration; also valerian seems more effective for chronic insomnia than acute episodes.Hop has different properties: calming, sleep inducing, gastric secretion stimulating and spasmolytic.Increasing GABAergic activity seems to be the main mechanism of action, thus inhibiting the central nervous system and also has demonstrated binding affinities to some of the melatonin and serotonin receptor.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundInsomnia is a widespread human health problem, but there currently are the limitations of conventional therapies available. Suanzaoren decoction (SZRD) is a well known classic Chinese herbal prescription for insomnia and has been treating people’s insomnia for more than thousand years. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SZRD for insomnia.MethodsA systematic literature search was performed for 6 databases up to July of 2012 to identify randomized control trials (RCTs) involving SZRD for insomniac patients. The methodological quality of RCTs was assessed independently using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.ResultsTwelve RCTs with total of 1376 adult participants were identified. The methodological quality of all included trials are no more than 3/8 score. Majority of the RCTs concluded that SZRD was more significantly effective than benzodiazepines for treating insomnia. Despite these positive outcomes, there were many methodological shortcomings in the studies reviewed, including insufficient information about randomization generation and absence of allocation concealment, lack of blinding and no placebo control, absence of intention-to-treat analysis and lack of follow-ups, selective publishing and reporting, and small number of sample sizes.

Abstract: BackgroundPrimary insomnia is a widespread and refractory disease. Moxibustion therapy for insomnia shows some advantages compared with conventional therapies. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of moxibustion therapy for insomnia.MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive literature review of the CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of science, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang Data databases from their inception to July 2015 for RCTs that compared moxibustion with western medications, oral Chinese medicine, or other methods of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in patients with primary insomnia. The primary outcome measure was effective rate and secondary outcome measure was adverse events. Data collection and analysis included risk of bias evaluation, meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis, publication bias and adverse events analysis according to corresponding criteria.ResultsThe study included 22 RCTs (1,971 patients). The quality of the studies was low. The overall meta-analysis demonstrated that moxibustion was more effective for insomnia than western medications, oral Chinese medicine and other TCM therapies (RR = 1.17, 95 % CI 1.12 to 1.23, P < 0.00001). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that moxibustion was more effective for insomnia than western medications (RR = 1.16, 95 % CI 1.09 to 1.24, P < 0.00001), oral Chinese medicine (RR = 1.11, 95 % CI 1.04 to 1.18, P = 0.002), and other TCM therapies (RR = 1.22, 95 % CI 1.15 to 1.30, P < 0.00001).",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundInsomnia is of major public health importance. While cognitive behavioral therapy is beneficial, in-person treatment is often unavailable. We assessed the effectiveness of internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia.ObjectivesThe primary objectives were to determine whether online cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia could improve sleep efficiency and reduce the severity of insomnia in adults. Secondary outcomes included sleep quality, total sleep time, time in bed, sleep onset latency, wake time after sleep onset, and number of nocturnal awakenings.Data SourcesWe searched PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, Embase, and the Web of Science for randomized trials.MethodsStudies were eligible if they were randomized controlled trials in adults that reported application of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia via internet delivery. Mean differences in improvement in sleep measures were calculated using the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method for random effects meta-analysis.ResultsWe found 15 trials, all utilizing a pretest-posttest randomized control group design. Sleep efficiency was 72% at baseline and improved by 7.2% (95% CI: 5.1%, 9.3%; p<0.001) with internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy versus control. Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy resulted in a decrease in the insomnia severity index by 4.3 points (95% CI: -7.1, -1.5; p = 0.017) compared to control. Total sleep time averaged 5.7 hours at baseline and increased by 20 minutes with internet-delivered therapy versus control (95% CI: 9, 31; p = 0.004).",systematic_review

Abstract: Objectives. This paper reviews the relationship between anxiety and anaphylaxis in children and youth, and principles for managing anxiety in the anaphylactic child and his or her parents. Methods. A review of the medical literature (Medline) was done using the keywords “anxiety,” “anaphylaxis,” and “allergy,” limited to children and adolescents. Findings were organized into categories used in the treatment of childhood anxiety disorders, then applied to managing anxiety in the anaphylactic child. Results. Twenty-four relevant papers were identified. These varied widely in methodology. Findings emphasized included the need to distinguish anxiety-related and organic symptoms, ameliorate the anxiety-related impact of anaphylaxis on quality of life, and address parental anxiety about the child. Conclusion. Children with anaphylaxis can function well despite anxiety, but the physical, cognitive, and behavioral aspects of anxiety associated with anaphylactic risk must be addressed, and parents must be involved in care in constructive ways.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundStudies have shown that family members of patients in intensive care units experience high levels of anxiety. Contradictions in the results of the studies conducted regarding the effect of training on the anxiety level of such families, emphasize the necessity of employing other research methods to eliminate these ambiguities.ObjectiveThis study applied meta-analysis to determine the effect of training on the anxiety level of families with patients in the intensive care unit.MethodsIn order to find electronically published studies from 1990 to 2016, the articles published in journals indexed in the following databases were used: Elsevier, Scopus, ProQuest, ISI, Web of Science, PubMed, Google scholar and Cochrane. For data analysis Stata Software version 11 was used and the heterogeneity index of studies was determined through Cochran (Q) and I2. Due to the heterogeneity, the random effect model was used to estimate the difference between the standardized mean of anxiety.ResultsIn this meta-analysis and systematic review article, eight articles were found to be eligible. The number of samples in the initial studies into a meta-analysis included 387 patients in the intervention group and 393 people in the control group. Standardized difference of the mean anxiety score in the intervention group was −0.329 (CI 95%: −0.756–0.099) units less than that of the control group, indicating that this effect was not statistically significant.ConclusionsThe results of this meta-analysis show that training will decline the anxiety level of a family with patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, although the impact is not considerable.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundSocial anxiety is among the most prevalent and debilitating affective disturbances manifest in people with psychosis. It is usually accompanied by high levels of depression and leads to significant social disability, lower quality of life and poorer prognosis as it raises the possibility of an early relapse. Despite its elevated prevalence and severity in psychosis, social anxiety remains under-recognized and under-treated. Cognitive-behavioural therapy is recommended for the treatment of people with psychosis. However, its focus and evaluation has primarily revolved around the reduction of psychotic symptoms, and not for co-morbid affective disturbances such as social anxiety. There is lack of evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural interventions for the treatment of social anxiety disorder in psychosis.Methods/DesignElectronic databases will be systematically searched for randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies investigating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural interventions for the treatment of social anxiety disorder in people with psychosis. Grey literature will also be searched by screening trial registers. Only studies published in English will be included in the review. Date restrictions will not be applied.

Abstract: AbstractBackground Interventions for depression among those with HIV/AIDS in Africa are being evaluated in increasing numbers. However, feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness have yet to be reviewed. We aimed to evaluate depression interventions performed in Africa for HIV infected adults.Methods Using key terms: depression, Africa, and HIV, we searched MEDLINE to identify depression interventions for adults with HIV in Africa. Women in the perinatal period were excluded. Data were extracted and the weighted relative change in depression scores for interventions and net effect over controls calculated.ResultsData were obtained from 18 articles (n = 1956 HIV-infected participants). Of those, 1358 received interventions and 558 were controls. Six of seven studies evaluating feasibility were positive vs. seven positive studies evaluating acceptability. Three studies investigated the use of psychotherapy (73% intervention decrease, 39% net decrease). Four studies investigated task-shifting of psychotherapy (47% intervention decrease, 34% net decrease). Three studies investigated antidepressants (79% intervention decrease, 39% net decrease). Three studies investigated task-shifting of antidepressant treatment (82% intervention decrease, 65% net decrease). An exercise intervention was evaluated (66% intervention decrease, 49% net decrease). One randomized trial investigated minocycline with insignificant results. Finally, three studies investigated other psychosocial interventions (44% intervention decrease, 21% net decrease).Conclusion Evaluation of 18 articles showed multiple interventions had high feasibility and acceptability for depression care in people with depression and HIV in Africa.",systematic_review

Abstract: This systematic review examines the efficacy of oral ginger for dysmenorrhea. Key biomedical databases and grey literature were searched. We included randomized controlled trials comparing oral ginger against placebo or active treatment in women with dysmenorrhea. Six trials were identified. Two authors independently reviewed the articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus with a third reviewer. We completed a narrative synthesis of all six studies and exploratory meta-analyses of three studies comparing ginger with placebo and two studies comparing ginger with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Ginger appeared more effective for reducing pain severity than placebo. The weighted mean difference on a 10 cm visual analogue scale was 1.55 cm (favoring ginger) (95% CI 0.68 to 2.43). No significant difference was found between ginger and mefenamic acid (an NSAID). The standardized mean difference was 0 (95% CI −0.40 to 0.41). Available data suggest that oral ginger could be an effective treatment for menstrual pain in dysmenorrhea. Findings, however, need to be interpreted with caution because of the small number of studies, poor methodological quality of the studies, and high heterogeneity across trials. The review highlights the need for future trials with high methodological quality.",systematic_review

Abstract: AimTo undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies to determine the effect of ginger supplementation on serum C-reactive protein (CRP), lipid profile, and glycaemia.MethodPubMed-MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Database, and Google Scholar databases were searched (up until July 2016) to identify prospective studies evaluating the impact of ginger supplementation on serum CRP. Random-effects model meta-analysis was used for quantitative data synthesis. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the leave-one-out method. Heterogeneity was quantitatively assessed using the I2 index. Systematic review registration: CRD42016035973.ResultsFrom a total of 265 entries identified via searches, 9 studies were included in the final selection. The meta-analysis indicated a significant reduction in serum CRP concentrations following ginger supplementation [weighted mean difference (WMD)−0.84 mg/L (95% CI −1.38 to −0.31, I2 56.3%)]. The WMD for fasting blood glucose and HbA1c was −1.35 mg/dl (95% CI −2.04 to −0.58, I2 12.1%) and −1.01 (95% CI −1.28 to −0.72, I2 9.4%), respectively. Moreover, high-density lipoprotein and triglyceride significantly improved after ginger administration [1.16 mg/dl (95% CI 0.52 to 1.08, I2 12.3%) and −1.63 mg/dl (95% CI −3.10 to −0.17, I2 8.1%), respectively]. These findings were robust in sensitivity analyses. Random-effects meta-regression revealed that changes in serum CRP levels were independent of the dosage of ginger supplementation (slope −0.20; 95% CI −0.95 to 0.55; p=0.60).ConclusionsThis meta-analysis suggests that ginger supplementation significantly reduces serum CRP and improves glycaemia indexes and lipid profile.",systematic_review

Abstract: AbstractGinger, the rhizome of Zingiber officinale, which is used as a spice globally has a long history of medicinal use that stimulates investigators to assess its potential roles as an adjuvant therapy or alternative medicine in a range of diseases. Anti‐inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor, and antiulcer effects of ginger have been proven in many scientific studies, and some of the ancient applications of ginger as a home remedy has been confirmed in human. In this review, we summarized the current evidence on the effects of ginger consumption on gastrointestinal disorders based on clinical trials. Our data indicate that divided lower daily dosage of 1500 mg ginger is beneficial for nausea relief. Because of limited number of studies on some other gastrointestinal disorders, the results may not be as much powered as to find significant results. Therefore, more extensive and well‐controlled human studies of ginger or its standard extracts are required to demonstrate its efficacy as a gastroprotective agent. Dose‐finding studies should be undertaken to accurately determine the effective dose and preparation of ginger in further clinical trials protocol.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundCardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which encompass a range of disorders impacting the heart and blood vessels, continue to pose a significant global public health challenge. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) has attracted attention among various treatment options for its potential advantages in promoting cardiovascular well-being. Renowned for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-hypertensive properties, ginger is a widely used culinary and medicinal plant. The objective of this research is to provide a comprehensive summary and systematic analysis of the existing scientific literature pertaining to the effects of ginger supplementation on glycemic profile, lipid profile, anthropometric measures, blood pressure, inflammatory markers, liver function tests, oxidative stress parameters, and adipokines. This analysis aims to establish a foundation for clinical interventions.MethodsA methodical electronic exploration will be carried out to discover articles in various databases such as Scopus, PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Web of Science. The search will specifically target randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that include both healthy and diseased individuals. Two evaluators will independently review articles, extract information, and evaluate the quality of the studies using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool (RoB 2). Any discrepancies will be addressed by involving a third reviewer. The quality of cumulative evidence will be evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria.",systematic_review

Abstract: AbstractBackground:Ancient medical practitioners used to encourage dietary supplements and herbal medicine for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Ginger (Zingiber officinale), is a nontoxic spice with negligible side effects, and is considered safe by the food and drug administration. In this analysis, we aimed to systematically compare fasting blood sugar (FBS) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at baseline versus at follow-up in T2DM patients who consumed and who did not consume ginger.Methods:A literature search was carried out through MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central, and www.ClinicalTrials.gov for English-published trials comparing glucose parameters in T2DM patients who were assigned to ginger consumption versus a control group. All the participants were patients with T2DM who were either assigned to ginger therapy (1600– 4000 mg daily) or to a control group. FBS and HbA1c were assessed in the ginger and control groups, respectively, from baseline to follow-up to observe any significant change. Weight mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated to represent the analysis which was carried out by the RevMan 5.3 software.Results:Eight randomized trials consisting of a total number of 454 participants with T2DM were included in this analysis. At first, FBS was compared in patients with T2DM from baseline prior to ginger consumption until follow-up after ginger consumption. The results showed no significant difference in FBS (WMD: 1.38, 95% CI: [−0.53–3.30]; P = .16). For the T2DM patients who did not consume ginger, no significant difference in FBS was observed (WMD: −0.27, 95% CI: [−5.09–4.54]; P = .91).",systematic_review

Abstract: Clinical applications of ginger with an expectation of clinical benefits are receiving significant attention. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive discussion in terms of the clinical effects of ginger in all reported areas. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline, randomized controlled trials on the effects of ginger were investigated. Accordingly, 109 eligible papers were fully extracted in terms of study design, population characteristics, evaluation systems, adverse effects, and main outcomes. The reporting quality of the included studies was assessed based on the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized trials and integrated together with studies that investigated the same subjects. The included studies that examined the improvement of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, inflammation, metabolic syndromes, digestive function, and colorectal cancer’s markers were consistently supported, whereas other expected functions were relatively controversial. Nevertheless, only 43 clinical trials (39.4%) met the criterion of having a ‘high quality of evidence.’ In addition to the quality assessment result, small populations and unstandardized evaluation systems were the observed shortcomings in ginger clinical trials. Further studies with adequate designs are warranted to validate the reported clinical functions of ginger.",systematic_review

Abstract: Background and aimsZingiber Officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been widely used traditionally in the daily diet and a variety of medicinal purposes. There are some animal studies on the hypotensive mechanism of ginger. The aim of this systematic review was to extract the evidence from all human participant randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that have assessed the effects of ginger on the blood pressure (BP) of any population.MethodsDatabases including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ISI Web of Science and also local databases including Sid, magiran, iranmedex were searched up to June, 2016 without language limitation. Relevant bibliographies were also searched. Titles and abstracts were assessed independently by two reviewers and full papers of relevant articles were obtained and assessed. Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials on humans were enrolled in the review. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were done by two reviewers independently and in a case of discrepancy final decision was made by the third reviewer. Meta-analysis was not possible because of heterogeneity of data and incomplete reporting of findings, thus results were synthesized narratively.ResultsInitial searches yielded 60 articles. After analyzing full-text papers, 2 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria. A double blind RCT (n=70) compared the effect of ginger with placebo on cardiovascular risk factors in diabetic patients. There was no significant (p>0.05) effect on systolic nor diastolic pressure (Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) changes was 0.1±1.1).",systematic_review

Abstract: The world's population is ageing at an accelerated pace. Ageing is a natural, physiological but highly complex and multifactorial process that all species in the Tree of Life experience over time. Physical and mental disabilities, and age-related diseases, would increase along with the increasing life expectancy. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is a plant that belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. For hundreds of years, ginger has been consumed in various ways by the natives of Asian countries, both as culinary and medicinal herb for the treatment of many diseases. Mounting evidence suggests that ginger can promote healthy ageing, reduce morbidity, and prolong healthy lifespan. Ginger, a well-known natural product, has been demonstrated to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antimicrobial properties, as well as an outstanding antiviral activity due to a high concentration of antiviral compounds. In this review, the current evidence on the potential role of ginger and its active compounds in the prevention of ageing is discussed.",systematic_review

Abstract: Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world, with breast cancer being the most prevalent cancer. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is one of the most serious side effects of chemotherapy. Because the current CINV treatment option has several flaws, alternative treatment options are required. Ginger has traditionally been used to treat nausea and vomiting, and it also has anticancer properties in breast cancer cells. Based on these findings, researchers investigated whether using ginger to treat CINV in breast cancer patients is both effective and safe. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, and Wanfang from inception to June 2022. Outcomes included Rhodes Index Scores of Nausea, Vomiting, and Retching, severity and frequency of CINV. Five RCTs were included. We pooled all included data and performed subgroup analysis by types of CINV. Overall, authors found that ginger was associated with a reduction in CINV. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis revealed that managing severity of acute CINV in breast cancer patients with ginger was efficient. In terms of managing delayed CINV in breast cancer patients, ginger was also statistically significant. The authors concluded that ginger may be helpful in lowering both acute and delayed CINV in breast cancer patients. Since there were no serious side effects, ginger is thought to be safe.",systematic_review

Abstract: It has been evidenced that very few systematic reviews have examined the effectiveness of ginger for pain duration and its severity among women with primary dysmenorrhea. This meta-analysis was therefore performed to methodically incorporate and significantly evaluate randomized controlled ginger studies for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. The literature was searched using PubMed, Embase, Ovid, ClinicalKey, Medline, and electronic database. We have analyzed clinical trials by comparing ginger with placebo and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in women with primary dysmenorrhea. The primary outcomes assessed in our meta-analysis were pain severity and pain duration. Secondary outcomes were change in bleeding, side effects of the drug, and rate of satisfaction. We have screened a total of 638 studies, out of which narrative synthesis was formulated for eight studies. We have performed a meta-analysis of five trials examining ginger with placebo and other two randomized controlled trials comparing ginger with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID); it seems to be more helpful for relieving menstrual pain than a placebo (mean difference [MD] = 2.67, 95% CI = 3.51-1.84, P = 0.0001, I2 = 86%), although it was found that ginger and NSAIDs were equally effective in pain severity (risk ratios [RR] = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.53-2.52, P = 0.72, I2 =77%). We have not observed any significant difference between ginger and placebo on pain duration among primary dysmenorrheic women (MD = -2.22, 95% CI = -7.62-3.18, P = 0.42, I2 = 56%). Accessible information proposes that oral ginger can be a compelling treatment for primary dysmenorrhea. This meta-analysis strongly supports the requirement for high methodological quality consistency for upcoming trials.",systematic_review

Abstract: AbstractThere is an evidence that ginger enhance semen quality via improving different sperm parameters mainly count, viability, motility, morphology and DNA integrity. According to research results in various species, ginger seems to have strong antioxidant properties (due to the presence of active phenolic compounds) and androgenic activity. Ginger improves semen quality and increases fertility of sperm by disrupting the production of free radicals, dissolving oxidative chain reactions, reducing oxidative stress and altering the levels of gonadotropin hormones (LH, FSH) and sex hormones (such as testosterone). The antioxidant and androgenic properties of ginger give a sperm with normal morphological structure (head, middle and tail) and more integrated chromatin. The rate of DNA failure and damage to the mitochondrial genome in these cells is minimal and they have the most progressive motility, the highest viability and the best fertility. Therefore, the use of the ginger significantly improves the biological parameters of sperm (number, total motility, survival rate and normal morphology) and also increases all specialized fertility indicators of sperm. Tacking account of lacking literature and possibility of toxicity and adverse effect of ginger on vital organ, further clinical trial especially on evaluating the safety and clinical effect must be considered. Also, dose and duration of consumption by monitoring of health indicators and biochemical changes in all species such as human, animal and poultry must be applied.",systematic_review

Abstract: Objective This article aims to assess the effects of ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and/or components of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Methods Electronic literature was searched in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Chinese Biomedical Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Database from inception of the database to May 19, 2017, and supplemented by browsing reference lists of potentially eligible articles. Randomized controlled trials on research subjects were included. Data were extracted as a mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analysis of fasting blood glucose (FBG) was performed. Results 10 studies met the inclusion criteria with a total of 490 individuals. Ginger showed a significant beneficial effect in glucose control and insulin sensitivity. The pooled weighted MD of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was −1.00, (95% CI: −1.56, −0.44; P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed that ginger obviously reduced FBG in T2DM patients (−21.24; 95% CI: −33.21, −9.26; P < 0.001). Meanwhile, the significant effects of improvement of lipid profile were observed. Most analyses were not statistically heterogeneous. Conclusion Based on the negligible side effects and obvious ameliorative effects on glucose control, insulin sensitivity, and lipid profile, ginger may be a promising adjuvant therapy for T2DM and MetS.",systematic_review

Abstract: Background and objectivesNausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) occur commonly. Possible harmful side-effects of conventional medicine to the fetus create the need for alternative options to relieve NVP. This systematic review (SR) investigated current evidence regarding orally administered ginger for the treatment of NVP. The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of ginger in treating NVP. The secondary objective was to assess the safety of ginger during pregnancy.MethodsA comprehensive electronic bibliographic database search was carried out. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the efficacy of orally administered ginger, as treatment for NVP in pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy, published in English, were included. Two researchers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. RevMan5 software (Cochrane Collaboration) was used for data analysis. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsTwelve RCTs involving 1278 pregnant women were included. Ginger significantly improved the symptoms of nausea when compared to placebo (MD 1.20, 95% CI 0.56-1.84, p = 0.0002, I2 = 0%). Ginger did not significantly reduce the number of vomiting episodes during NVP, when compared to placebo, although there was a trend towards improvement (MD 0.72, 95% CI -0.03-1.46, p = 0.06, I2 = 71%). Subgroup analyses seemed to favor the lower daily dosage of <1500 mg ginger for nausea relief. Ginger did not pose a significant risk for spontaneous abortion compared to placebo (RR 3.14, 95% CI 0.65-15.11, p = 0.15; I2 = 0%), or to vitamin B6 (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.17-1.42, p = 0.19, I2 = 40%).",systematic_review

Abstract: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) affects over 50% of pediatric patients undergoing chemotherapy, a higher proportion than in adults. CINV often occurs despite adequate antiemetic prophylaxis, hampering patients' willingness to continue the chemotherapy regimen. As an ayurvedic medicine, ginger (Zingiber officinale) has an antiemetic effect by inhibiting serotonin in gastrointestinal nerves and as an NK1 antagonist. Therefore, we aimed to review oral ginger supplementation in children with CINV systematically.Systematic searching was performed in June 2023 from Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, and hand searching. The search consisted of PICO “children chemotherapy”, “ginger”, and “CINV incidence”. We limited the search to only human studies. Studies that meet inclusion and exclusion criteria were included for analysis.Out of 116 studies found with our selection criteria, four were compatible with inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two studies had a small Risk of Bias (RoB), while the others had a high RoB. All studies statistically significantly reduced acute and delayed CINV with the number needed to treat (NNT) 2–4. No adverse effects were reported. However, these studies still had high heterogeneity based on cancer treatment, chemotherapy regimen, ginger dosing, and ginger processing.Ginger has the potential to reduce both the acute and delayed phases of CINV in children. Additional research employing standardized methodologies is recommended to validate this effect.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundDigestive disorders pose significant burdens to millions of people worldwide in terms of morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Turmeric has been traditionally used for conditions associated with the digestive system, and its therapeutic benefits were also confirmed in clinical studies. However, rigorous systematic review on this topic is severely limited. Our study aims to systematically review the therapeutic and adverse effects of turmeric and its compounds on digestive disorders, including dyspepsia, peptic ulcer, irritable bowel disease, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.Methods/DesignThis study will include both randomized controlled trials and non-randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy and safety of turmeric or its compounds in comparison to a placebo or any other active interventions for digestive disorders without any restrictions on participant age or language of publication. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients that have experienced treatment success. Secondary outcomes are the prevalence of an individual symptom of digestive disorders, the proportion of patients who experienced relapse, the number of physician visits/hospitalization due to digestive disorders, health-related quality of life and the proportion of patients who experienced adverse events. Relevant studies will be identified through MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, Dissertations & Theses Database and the Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials from their inception to August 31, 2013.

Abstract: The effective management of diabetes, a prevalent metabolic condition globally, relies on paying close attention to anthropometric measurements, while recent years have seen a growing interest in researching the potential anti-obesity properties of turmeric/curcumin. In this systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, the impact of turmeric/curcumin supplementation on anthropometric indices in individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was assessed. PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched to identify relevant records published from 1 January 1990 to 1 June 2024. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI), with a p-value ≤ 0.05 indicating statistical significance. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to assess the certainty of evidence. Twenty randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled analysis displayed that supplementation with turmeric/curcumin significantly decreased body weight (WMD: −1.9 kg; 95% CI: −2.9 to −0.9; P ≤ 0.001; GRADE = low), waist circumference (WMD: −1.9 cm; 95% CI: −3.5 to −0.2; P = 0.024; GRADE = low), fat mass% (WMD: −2.9%; 95% CI: −5.6 to −0.1, P = 0.041; GRADE = very low), and hip circumference (WMD: −1.0 cm; 95% CI: −1.2 to −0.8; P ≤ 0.001; GRADE = moderate) but no effects on body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio in people with T2DM.",systematic_review

Abstract: Background: Turmeric (Curcuma longa) and its main bioactive compound curcumin are widely promoted for cardiometabolic health, yet their efficacy on lipid parameters remains uncertain. Piperine, an alkaloid from black pepper, enhances curcumin bioavailability and may potentiate its effects. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of turmeric, alone or combined with piperine, on lipid profiles in adults with metabolic disorders. Methods: A systematic search was conducted (2010–2025) in PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane CENTRAL. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating turmeric supplementation (with or without piperine) on lipid outcomes were included. Methodological quality was assessed with Cochrane RoB 2; certainty of evidence was rated using GRADE. Meta-analyses were performed with random-effects models. The protocol followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Results: Ten records were identified; six full texts were assessed; three RCTs (n ≈ 250) were included in quantitative synthesis, and three additional RCTs narratively. Pooled analysis demonstrated significant reductions in triglycerides (WMD −25.5 mg/dL, 95% CI −32.5 to −18.4), total cholesterol (−14.1 mg/dL, 95% CI −22.9 to −5.3), and LDL-C (−17.0 mg/dL, 95% CI −25.2 to −8.8), with an increase in HDL-C (+5.7 mg/dL, 95% CI +2.0 to +9.4). Subgroup analysis suggested greater LDL-C reduction with turmeric+piperine (−29.6 mg/dL) compared to turmeric alone (−16.2 mg/dL). Certainty of evidence was moderate for TG, TC, LDL-C, and low for HDL-C.",systematic_review

Abstract: Curcumin is the principal polylphenol of turmeric that has been used to treat various disorders. However, its anti-obesity effects in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remain controversial. Therefore, we aimed to perform a meta-analysis on the effects of supplementation with turmeric/curcumin on body weight, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) in these patients. PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and ISI Web of Science were searched until January 2019, without any restrictions. Clinical trials that reported body weight, BMI and WC in patients with NAFLD were included. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) were pooled using a random-effects model. Eight studies (449 participants) fulfilled the eligibility criteria of the present meta-analysis. Overall, meta-analysis could not show any beneficial effect of turmeric/curcumin supplementation on body weight (WMD, −0.54 kg; 95% confidence interval [CI], −2.40, 1.31; p = 0.56; I2 = 0.0%), BMI (WMD, −0.21 kg/m2; 95% CI, −0.71, 0.28; p = 0.39; I2 = 0.0%) and WC (WMD, −0.88 cm; 95% CI, −3.76, 2.00; p = 0.54; I2 = 0.0%). Subgroup analysis based on participants' baseline BMI, type of intervention, and study duration did not show any significant association in all subgroups. The results showed that turmeric/curcumin supplementation had no signiﬁcant effect on body weight, BMI and WC in patients with NAFLD. Further studies with large-scale are needed to find out possible anti-obesity effects of turmeric/curcumin.",systematic_review

Abstract: ABSTRACTIntroductionHypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor in individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Curcumin, with its anti‐inflammatory and antioxidant properties, has emerged as a potential adjunct therapy, but its effect on blood pressure in this population remains unclear.AimsThis meta‐analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of curcumin or turmeric supplementation on systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure in adults with prediabetes or T2D.MethodsA systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted until August 2025. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating curcumin/turmeric supplementation on blood pressure in adults with prediabetes or T2D were included. A meta‐analysis was performed using a random‐effects model.ResultsFifteen RCTs comprising 16 treatment arms (n = 855 participants) were included. Pooled results indicated that curcumin/turmeric supplementation significantly reduced SBP (WMD: −2.69 mmHg; 95% CI: −3.84 to −1.55; p < 0.001; I 2 = 30.1%) compared to control groups. A more substantial reduction in SBP (−3.41 mmHg) was observed in the subgroup of participants with baseline hypertension (SBP ≥ 130 mmHg). However, no significant effect was found on DBP (WMD: −1.20 mmHg; 95% CI: −2.84 to 0.44; p = 0.15; I 2 = 84.3%). Subgroup analyses showed significant reductions in SBP in individuals with T2D or prediabetes, in those who were overweight, and with interventions using nano‐curcumin, turmeric, or curcumin with piperine at doses > 1 g/day.",systematic_review

Abstract: Background:Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent disorder of the gut interaction characterized by abdominal discomfort and pain associated with altered bowel habits in the absence of structural abnormalities. In spite of IBS' high prevalence and disease burden across the globe, no explanations have been given as to its underlying pathophysiology. As for the treatment of IBS, there is no specific medication, and the most beneficial treatment is usually supportive therapy. Recent animal and human studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of curcumin or turmeric in the treatment of IBS.Methods:We systematically reviewed all available evidence supporting curcumin and turmeric's therapeutic potential in relieving IBS symptoms in the present study. For this purpose, a database search was performed using curcumin, turmeric, and IBS and all their equivalents as of the search terms in Web of Science, Pub-Med, Scopus, Ovid, Embase, and Google Scholar from1990 up to Feb 2021. The investigation was then limited to clinical trials, and then nine articles were collected for data analysis.Results:The findings of the included literature showed that curcumin and turmeric alone or in combination with other medications could improve the severity of IBS as well as the quality of life among people who suffer from IBS symptoms.Conclusion:Overall, medications containing curcumin and turmeric extract due to these compounds' anti-inflammatory effects may improve IBS symptoms, particularly abdominal pain and life quality.",systematic_review

Abstract: PurposeTo determine whether supplementation with turmeric or curcumin extract effects pain and physical function in individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Second, we investigated the therapeutic response (pain and function) of turmeric compared with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).MethodsA search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Review. Inclusion criteria included randomised controlled trials reporting pain and physical function in humans with knee OA comparing turmeric therapy with NSAIDs or no therapy. Two reviewers screened 5273 abstracts. Risk of bias and quality were assessed via Cochrane Collaboration tool and CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) 2010, respectively.ResultsTen studies were included in the final analysis. Eight had high methodological quality and two were categorised as good with a mean CONSORT quality score of 21.1. Nine studies had adequate sequence generation and six had adequate allocation concealment. Participants and outcome assessors were blinded in eight studies. Three of the studies compared turmeric therapy to NSAIDs. All 10 studies showed improvement in pain and function from baseline with turmeric therapy (p≤0.05). In three studies comparing turmeric to NSAIDs, there were no differences in outcome scores (p>0.05). In all studies there were no significant adverse events in the turmeric therapy group.ConclusionCompared with placebo, there appears to be a benefit of turmeric on knee OA pain and function. Based on a small number of studies the effects are similar to that of NSAIDs. Variables such as optimal dosing, frequency and formulation remain unclear at this time.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundOral mucositis is a major complication for head and neck cancer (HNC) patients after radiotherapy or chemotherapy. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the efficacy of turmeric in the treatment of oral mucositis in HNC patients.MethodsRandomized controlled trials investigating our topic were included in the meta-analysis. The clinical outcomes considered were the severity of oral mucositis, pain level, and weight loss.ResultsA total of eight articles that met our inclusion criteria were included in our meta-analysis. At the 3-week follow-up visit, the turmeric group showed significantly lower grades of oral mucositis compared to the control group (p = 0.03). When compared to the placebo group, a significant difference in the degree of oral mucositis was observed at the 4-(p = 0.03) and 6-week (p < 0.00001) follow-up visits. No significant difference in pain levels was observed between the turmeric and control groups at any of the follow-up visits. However, a significant improvement in pain levels for the turmeric group when compared with the placebo group was observed only at the 6-week follow-up visit (p = 0.006). Interestingly, a significant improvement in pain levels was observed for the turmeric group at the 2-, 4-, 5-, and 6-week follow-up visits (p < 0.05) when compared to the non-placebo group. The turmeric group showed less weight loss than the control group at the final follow-up visit (p = 0.03).conclusionOur meta-analysis showed that using turmeric may be effective in improving both the severity of oral mucositis and pain levels in HNC patients who have received radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundSeveral studies reported that curcumin supplementation could improve non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of curcumin/turmeric supplementation on liver enzymes in patients with NAFLD.MethodsPubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar were systematically searched until December 2017. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which examined effect of curcumin/turmeric supplementation on NAFLD in adult participants. Main outcome was alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Potential risks of bias (ROB) were assessed by using Cochrane ROB tool.ResultsAll included studies showed low ROB in most of item of Cochrane ROB tool. Meta-analysis of 4 randomized controlled trials including 228 subjects showed a trend toward significant reduction of ALT blood concentrations in subgroup with ≥1000 mg/day curcumin supplementation (–11.36 IU/L, 95% CI: –22.75 to 0.02; I2:51%). Meta-analysis showed a significant reduction of AST in studies with 8-weeks administration (–9.22 IU/L, 95% CI: –12.77 to –5.67; I2: 49%).ConclusionThis review suggests that curcumin/turmeric might have a favorable effect on NAFLD in higher dosage.

Abstract: BackgroundTurmeric has traditionally been used to treat various inflammatory conditions, including knee osteoarthritis (OA). There are multiple turmeric preparations available. However, the comparative effectiveness of these products remains unknown. This study aimed to assess the comparative effectiveness of turmeric products for knee OA outcomes by conducting a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs).MethodsPubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched up to August 2024, identifying RCTs that compared turmeric preparations and/or active comparators versus placebo. The primary outcome measured pain reduction, using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), while secondary outcomes evaluated pain using other tools. Mean differences (MDs) were pooled using a random-effects model, and the concept of minimum clinically important difference (MCID) was considered.ResultsSeventeen studies were included. All turmeric preparations significantly reduced WOMAC pain. The mean differences (MD, 95% CI) for WOMAC pain reduction were as follows: − 4.01 (–6.22, − 1.80) for conventional curcuminoid preparations (CT) plus active drug comparators (AC, defined as NSAIDs and acetaminophen), − 3.33 (–5.26, − 1.39) for AC, − 3.17 (–5.50, − 0.83) for CT, and − 2.47 (–3.27, − 1.67) for bioavailability-enhanced curcuminoid preparations (BE).

Abstract: AIM:The review elaborates on the efficacy of turmeric/curcumin formulations on chemo/radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer.METHODS:This systematic review was conducted; trials were included comparing turmeric/curcumin formulations with chlorhexidine/povidone-iodine/normal saline or any conventional practices in head and neck cancer patients. Studies published through May 2023 were identified using Medline, Web of Science, CINAHL, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. A systematic review was conducted, including a meta-analysis, following PRISMA guidelines. The methodology’s quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.RESULTS:Thirteen of the 14 studies found that turmeric formulation contributed to reducing the occurrence (p < .0001) and intensity of oral mucositis (p = .001) and significantly lesser incidence of secondary outcomes such as pain (p = .001), erythema (p = .05), dysphagia (p < .05), ulcer size (p = .000), burning sensation (p < .001), dermatitis (p < .05), and weight loss (p < .001) in the turmeric group. There was also a lesser incidence of treatment breaks (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy) due to the severity of mucositis and other complications. The risk of bias was judged as low for six studies (a score of five or higher), medium in three studies (four out of seven), and high risk for the other five.CONCLUSION:The reviewers identified that turmeric formulations reduced the severity of oral mucositis.

Abstract: Background:Oral Mucositis(OM) is an acute debilitating dose limiting toxicity of Radiotherapy/Radiochemotherapy(RT/RCT) in management of Head and Neck Cancer (HNC). Curcumin/Turmeric may reduce OM in patients. Aim: Efficacy of Curcumin/Turmeric for preventing and ameliorating the onset and severity of RT/RCT induced OM was analysed in this review. Methods:A systematic literature search with meta-analysis were performed using Mesh terms in PubMed, Google scholar, Science Direct, Cochrane library and manual searching, articles published from 2010 to April 2021 were included. Clinical trials that studied the efficacy/effects of turmeric / curcumin in management of RT/RCT induced OM in HNC patients were included. Statistical Analysis were done to calculate the pooled Risk ratio at 95%confidence interval with significance at p <0.05. Results:Nine studies with overall 582 patients with HNC undergoing RT/RCT were included qualitatively.

Abstract: AbstractAlthough turmeric and its curcumin-enriched extracts have been used for treating arthritis, no systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been conducted to evaluate the strength of the research. We systemically evaluated all RCTs of turmeric extracts and curcumin for treating arthritis symptoms to elucidate the efficacy of curcuma for alleviating the symptoms of arthritis. Literature searches were conducted using 12 electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Korean databases, Chinese medical databases, and Indian scientific database. Search terms used were “turmeric,” “curcuma,” “curcumin,” “arthritis,” and “osteoarthritis.” A pain visual analogue score (PVAS) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) were used for the major outcomes of arthritis. Initial searches yielded 29 articles, of which 8 met specific selection criteria. Three among the included RCTs reported reduction of PVAS (mean difference: −2.04 [−2.85, −1.24]) with turmeric/curcumin in comparison with placebo (P < .00001), whereas meta-analysis of four studies showed a decrease of WOMAC with turmeric/curcumin treatment (mean difference: −15.36 [−26.9, −3.77]; P = .009). Furthermore, there was no significant mean difference in PVAS between turmeric/curcumin and pain medicine in meta-analysis of five studies. Eight RCTs included in the review exhibited low to moderate risk of bias. There was no publication bias in the meta-analysis. In conclusion, these RCTs provide scientific evidence that supports the efficacy of turmeric extract (about 1000 mg/day of curcumin) in the treatment of arthritis.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundProbiotics are microorganisms, mainly bacteria, which benefit the host’s health. Many studies support the role of probiotics as a contributor to gastrointestinal health, and nowadays many authors are trying to prove its influence in oral health maintenance. ObjectivesTo review the published literature with the purpose of knowing the importance of using probiotics as a preventive and therapeutic method for oral infectious diseases management.Material and MethodsAn electronic search in PubMed database with the keywords “oral health AND probiotics AND dentistry” was conducted. The inclusion criteria were: randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that assess the action of any probiotic strain in the treatment and / or prevention of an infectious oral disease, RCTs that assess the action of any probiotic strain on counting colony forming units (CFU) of oral pathogens, systematic reviews and meta-analysis. The Jadad scale was used to assess the high quality of RCTs.ResultsFifteen articles were considered for this review. Of which, 12 were RCTs of good / high quality (Jadad scale), two meta-analysis and one systematic review.ConclusionsThe literature reviewed suggests probiotics usage could be beneficial for the maintenance of oral health, due to its ability to decrease the colony forming units (CFU) counts of the oral pathogens. However, randomized clinical trials with long-term follow-up periods are needed to confirm their efficacy in reducing the prevalence/incidence of oral infectious diseases. Furthermore, the recognition of specific strains with probiotic activity for each infectious oral disease is required, in order to determine exact dose, treatment time and ideal vehicles.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundOral rehydration salts (ORS), zinc, and continued feeding are the recommended treatments for community-acquired acute diarrhea among young children. However, probiotics are becoming increasingly popular treatments for diarrhea in some countries. We sought to estimate the effect of probiotics on diarrhea morbidity and mortality in children < 5 years of age.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials to estimate the effect of probiotic microorganisms for the treatment of community-acquired acute diarrhea in children. Data were abstracted into a standardized table and study quality was assessed using the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group (CHERG) adaption of the GRADE technique. We measured the relative effect of probiotic treatment in addition to recommended rehydration on hospitalizations, duration and severity. We then calculated the average percent difference for all continuous outcomes and performed a meta-analysis for discrete outcomes.ResultsWe identified 8 studies for inclusion in the final database. No studies reported diarrhea mortality and overall the evidence was low to moderate quality. Probiotics reduced diarrhea duration by 14.0% (95% CI: 3.8-24.2%) and stool frequency on the second day of treatment by 13.1% (95% CI: 0.8 – 25.3%). There was no effect on the risk of diarrhea hospitalizations.ConclusionProbiotics may be efficacious in reducing diarrhea duration and stool frequency during a diarrhea episode.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundInfantile colic is a common paediatric condition which causes significant parental distress. Increased intestinal coliform colonization in addition to alteration in Lactobacillus abundance and distribution may play an important role in its pathogenesis.The objectives of this systematic review are to evaluate the efficacy of probiotic supplementation in the reduction of crying time and successful treatment of infantile colic.MethodsLiterature searches were conducted of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Only randomized controlled trials enrolling term, healthy infants with colic were included. A meta-analysis of included trials was performed utilizing the Cochrane Collaboration methodology.ResultsThree trials that enrolled 220 breastfed infants met inclusion criteria, of which 209 infants were available for analysis. Two of the studies were assessed as good quality. Lactobacillus reuteri (strains-American Type Culture Collection Strain 55730 and DSM 17 938) was the only species utilized in the therapeutic intervention. Two of the trials were industry funded. Probiotic supplementation compared to simethicone or placebo significantly and progressively shortened crying times to 7 days reaching a plateau at three weeks post initiation of therapy [mean difference −56.03 minutes; 95% CI (−59.92, -52.15)]. Similarly, probiotics compared to placebo significantly increased the treatment success of infantile colic with a relative risk (RR) of 0.06; 95% CI (0.01, 0.25) and a number needed to treat of 2.ConclusionsAlthough L. reuteri may be effective as a treatment strategy for crying in exclusively breastfed infants with colic, the evidence supporting probiotic use for the treatment of infant colic or crying in formula-fed infants remains unresolved.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundAntibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) are associated with high morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Probiotics may mitigate the existing disease burden. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of co-administration of probiotics with antibiotics in preventing these adverse outcomes in adult inpatients.MethodsSystematic searches of MEDLINE (1946 to May 2012), Embase (1980 to May 2012), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were undertaken on May 31, 2012, to identify relevant publications. We searched for randomized controlled trials, published in English, of adult inpatients who were receiving antibiotics and who were randomly assigned to co-administration of probiotics or usual care, with or without the use of placebo. Studies were included if they reported on AAD or CDI (or both) as outcomes. Data for predetermined criteria evaluating study characteristics, methods, and risk of bias were extracted. Trials were given a global rating of good, fair, or poor by at least 2 reviewers. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model, and pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.ResultsSixteen trials met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Four studies were of good quality, 5 were of fair quality, and 7 were of poor quality. Pooled analyses revealed significant reductions in the risks of AAD (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.79) and CDI (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.61) among patients randomly assigned to co-administration of probiotics.",systematic_review

Abstract: Probiotics have been linked to a reduction in the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and late-onset sepsis in preterm infants. Recently, probiotics have also proved to reduce time to achieve full enteral feeding (FEF). However, the relationship between FEF achievement and type of feeding in infants treated with probiotics has not been explored yet. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of probiotics in reducing time to achieve FEF in preterm infants, according to type of feeding (exclusive human milk (HM) vs. formula). Randomized-controlled trials involving preterm infants receiving probiotics, and reporting on time to reach FEF were included in the systematic review. Trials reporting on outcome according to type of feeding (exclusive HM vs. formula) were included in the meta-analysis. Fixed-effect or random-effects models were used as appropriate. Results were expressed as mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Twenty-five studies were included in the systematic review. In the five studies recruiting exclusively HM-fed preterm infants, those treated with probiotics reached FEF approximately 3 days before controls (MD −3.15 days (95% CI −5.25/−1.05), p = 0.003). None of the two studies reporting on exclusively formula-fed infants showed any difference between infants receiving probiotics and controls in terms of FEF achievement. The limited number of included studies did not allow testing for other subgroup differences between HM and formula-fed infants. However, if confirmed in further studies, the 3-days reduction in time to achieve FEF in exclusively HM-fed preterm infants might have significant implications for their clinical management.",systematic_review

Abstract: Over the years, probiotics have been used in the treatment of a variety of diseases. The use of probiotics in the treatment of periodontal disease has caught on over the last decade or so. This review was performed to determine whether administration of probiotics produced a lasting clinical benefit in the treatment of periodontal disease. A MEDLINE, Cochrane database and a hand search was performed on human randomized placebo controlled trials using probiotics in the treatment of periodontal disease. A total of thirteen papers which addressed the question of the use of probiotics in the treatment of periodontal disease were retrieved. Most of the studies reviewed showed only a short term benefit with regards to reduction in gingival inflammation and probing depth reduction. Lasting clinical benefits were not seen in any of the studies. At least four different combinations and strains of probiotics have been used in the studies. There also existed significant heterogeneity in the methodology of the studies reviewed. It was concluded that current regimens of probiotics in the treatment of periodontal disease produce only short-term clinical and microbiologic benefits.",systematic_review

Abstract: IntroductionBacterial vaginosis (BV) is a highly prevalent vaginal polymicrobial disorder commonly encountered in women of childbearing age. Therapy with only recommended antibiotics results in low cure rates and unacceptably high recurrence rates. The use of probiotics as a complementary approach for use with antibiotics for the treatment of BV remains unclear. This review aims to assess the efficacy of lactobacilli administered intravaginally in conjunction with antibiotics for the treatment of BV.Methods and analysisThe Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, Medline/PubMed and Embase will be used to search for articles from database inception to November 2016. Randomised controlled clinical trials using lactobacilli administered intravaginally in conjunction with antibiotics to treat BV will be included. Primary outcome will be the BV cure rate. The recurrence rate will be examined as secondary outcome. Two reviewers will independently select trials and extract data from the original publications. The risk of bias will be assessed according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We will perform data synthesis using the Review Manager (RevMan) software V.5.2.3. To assess heterogeneity, we will compute the I2 statistic.Ethics and disseminationThis study will be a review of published data and it is not necessary to obtain ethical approval.

Abstract: IntroductionInfantile colic is a common pediatric problem. The cause of infantile colic remains unclear. Treatment options are limited. Evidence suggests that probiotics might offer some benefit. The aim of the study was to systematically assess the effectiveness of probiotics supplementation in the management of infantile colic.Material and methodsMEDLINE and the Cochrane Library were searched up to April 2016 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of probiotics (any well-defined strain) compared with placebo for the management of infantile colic. The outcome measures of interest were treatment success and the duration of crying at the end of the intervention.ResultsSeven RCTs (471 participants) were included. Compared with placebo the administration of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 at a daily dose of 108 CFU was associated with the treatment success (relative risk = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.10–2.81, number needed to treat 5, 95% CI: 4–8) and reduced crying times at the end of the intervention (mean difference: –49 min, 95% CI: –66 to –33); however, the effect was mainly seen in exclusively breastfed infants. Other probiotics (single or in combinations) were studied in single trials only.ConclusionsSome probiotics, primarily L. reuteri DSM 17938, may be considered for the management of infantile colic.

Abstract: Background: Neonatal jaundice is a relatively prevalent disease and affects approximately 2.4–15% newborns. Probiotics supplementation therapy could assist to improve the recovery of neonatal jaundice, through enhancing immunity mainly by regulating bacterial colonies. However, there is limited evidence regarding the effect of probiotics on bilirubin level in neonates. Therefore, this study aims at systematically evaluating the efficacy and safety of probiotics supplement therapy for pathological neonatal jaundice.Methods: Databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Fang Database (Wan Fang), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (VIP) were searched and the deadline is December 2016. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics supplementation for pathological neonatal jaundice in publications were extracted by two reviewers. The cochrane tool was applied to assessing the risk of bias of the trials. The extracted information of RCTs should include efficacy rate, serum total bilirubin level, time of jaundice fading, duration of phototherapy, duration of hospitalization, adverse reactions. The main outcomes of the trials were analyzed by Review Manager 5.3 software. The relative risks (RR) or mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to measure the effect.Results: 13 RCTs involving 1067 neonatal with jaundice were included in the meta-analysis. Probiotics supplementation treatment showed efficacy [RR: 1.19, 95% CI (1.12, 1.26), P < 0.00001] in neonatal jaundice.",systematic_review

Abstract: Background and aimsAngiogenesis is the process of new blood vessel sprouting from the existing vasculature. It is physiologically present during wound healing, development of placenta, tissue growth and adipogenesis as well as playing role in pathological processes such as tumor growth, metastasis, obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Angiogenesis therapy is as a Strategy for treatment of some diseases. The angiogenic process is regulated by numerous factors e.g. dietary factors. In this paper, we reviewed available documents and research relevant to vitamin D and angiogenesis.MethodsA systematic review of recent literature was conducted using the PRISMA guidelines. The sources of the data were PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane, Web of Science and Scopus. Key search terms were “Angiogenesis”, “Angiogenesis factor”, “vitamin D”, “1,25 (OH)2 D3” and “Calciteriol”. Articles included in the review were original research articles in peer-reviewed journals which thoroughly examined and compared on the basis of study design, outcomes, and results.ResultsThe effect of vitamin D on angiogenesis was first reported in 1990. Evidence from current studies supports anti-angiogenesis and pro-angiogenesis effects of the 1, 25 (OH) 2 D3 in several in vivo and in vitro studies. Results from recent studies implies that different effects of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D3 on angiogenesis depends on the cellular types, cellular condition and type of chemokines released from the tissue.",systematic_review

Abstract: Melatonin is an indolamine produced by the pineal gland and it can exert a potent antioxidant effect. Its free radical scavenger properties have been used to advantage in different organ transplants in animal experiments. Several concentrations and administration pathways have been tested and melatonin has shown encouraging beneficial results in many transplants of organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, pancreas, and kidneys. The objective of the present study was to review the scientific literature regarding the use of melatonin in ovary transplantation. A systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was carried out using the Cochrane and Pubmed databases and employing the terms ‘melatonin’ AND ‘ovary’ AND ‘transplantation.’ After analysis, 5 articles were extracted addressing melatonin use in ovary transplants and involving 503 animals. Melatonin enhanced various graft aspects like morphology, apoptosis, immunological reaction, revascularization, oxidative stress, and survival rate. Melatonin’s antioxidative and antiapoptotic properties seemingly produce positive effects on ovarian graft activity. Despite the promising results, further studies in humans need to be conducted to consolidate its use, as ovary transplantation for fertility preservation is gradually being moved from the experimental stage to a clinical setting.",systematic_review

Abstract: AbstractBackgroundMelatonin administration to high cholesterol-treated and high fat-treated rats has been shown to suppress body weight and visceral adiposity. In addition, in various animal models related to obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes, melatonin has beneficial efficacy in ameliorating various metabolic symptoms, including attenuating weight gain, lowering blood pressure (BP), and improving insulin resistance. This systematic review aims to investigate whether melatonin or melatonin agonists significantly attenuate metabolic side effects among psychiatric populations treated with atypical antipsychotics.MethodsFour randomized controlled trials were identified through a comprehensive literature search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library on 22 October 2015. These four trials (including three melatonin studies and one ramelteon study) included 138 patients, of whom 71 were treated with melatonin or ramelteon and 67 were treated with a placebo. Because of high heterogeneity, we did not carry out a meta analysis.ResultsMelatonin was beneficial in lowering blood pressure among bipolar disorder patients; this blood pressure-lowering effect was not prominent among schizophrenic patients. Melatonin appeared to improve lipid profiles and body composition and attenuated weight gain among both schizophrenic and bipolar disorder patients. Ramelteon showed a significant efficacy in lowering total cholesterol level.DiscussionDespite the few studies included, this systematic review provided promising evidence of the potential benefits of melatonin and its agonists in attenuating one or more components of metabolic syndrome among psychiatric patients using atypical antipsychotics.",systematic_review

Electronic database of PubMed, Medline, Embase, and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) were searched for relevant studies between 2005 and 2014. The odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) were employed to estimate the association. Total ten case-control studies, including 3428 GDM cases and 4637 healthy controls, met the inclusion criteria. Our results showed a significant association between the three genetic variants and GDM risk, rs10830963 with a P-value less than 0.0001, rs1387153 with a P-value of 0.0002, and rs1801278 with a P-value of 0.001. Furthermore, all the genetic models in these three polymorphisms were associated with increased risks of GDM as well (P< = 0.009). In conclusion, our study found that the genetic polymorphisms rs10830963 and rs1387153 in MTNR1B and rs1801278 in IRS1 were associated with an increased risk of developing GDM. However, further studies with gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions should be considered.",systematic_review

Abstract: Key PointsQuestionWhat are the long-term outcomes (safety and effectiveness) associated with melatonin use in young children?FindingsThis systematic review of 19 studies found that melatonin prescribing practices, extended use, and overdoses in young children (aged 0-6 years) increased in the past 2 decades. Five interventional trials found that young children with autism spectrum disorder or related conditions fell asleep faster after treatment, but none examined efficacy in children with typical development or measured outcomes beyond 2 years.MeaningThese findings suggest that medical professionals should discuss behavioral interventions with young children to reduce medication usage and overdose.",systematic_review

Abstract: ABSTRACTBackground and AimsPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent gynecological condition affecting women of reproductive age, with implications for multiple aspects of women's health. Recent research indicates that melatonin (MLT) may enhance several dimensions of this syndrome via various mechanisms. Consequently, this study was undertaken to systematically evaluate the impact of MLT supplementation on different aspects of PCOS.MethodsAccording to the PRISMA guideline, we identified studies published between January 2013 and November 4, 2024, through a comprehensive electronic search of several reputable databases, including Web of Science (WoS), PubMed (MEDLINE), ProQuest, Scopus, and Google Scholar, utilizing MESH keywords. A meta‐analysis was conducted employing a random‐effects model, during which we computed the standardized mean differences (SMDs) along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals.ResultsA total of 12 studies were incorporated into the meta‐analysis, encompassing 1590 women diagnosed with PCOS. Among these participants, 710 were assigned to the intervention group, while 692 were placed in the comparison or control group, representing data collected from six countries. The SMD for total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and endometrial thickness were 0.97 [95% CI 0.55; 1.40, p: < 0.001, τ 2: < 0.001], 0.50 [95% CI 0.29; 0.70, p: < 0.01, τ 2: 0.01, I 2: 26.38%].",systematic_review

Journal: Clinics and Practice
Published: 2025

Abstract: Background: Burnout among healthcare professionals is increasingly recognized as a syndrome with biological correlations. Beyond psychosocial factors, circadian misalignment, sleep disturbances, and hormonal dysregulation—particularly involving melatonin and cortisol—are emerging as relevant mechanisms. Methods: We systematically reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2025 examining associations between burnout, melatonin, circadian disruption, sleep quality, and related biomarkers in healthcare workers. Results: Across 14 included studies, burnout was associated with suppressed melatonin secretion, cortisol dysregulation, and circadian misalignment, including social jet lag and poor sleep quality. Night-shift nurses consistently displayed greater circadian disruption and higher burnout scores than day-shift colleagues. Evidence also suggests that environmental and interventional approaches—such as optimizing daylight exposure and melatonin supplementation to improve sleep quality and cognitive performance—may mitigate circadian disruption and occupational fatigue. Conclusions: Burnout should be recognized as a biopsychosocial syndrome with measurable chronobiological correlates. Future research should integrate circadian biomarkers into occupational health assessments and evaluate preventive strategies aimed at preserving circadian health in healthcare professionals.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundDelirium is a syndrome characterized by acute fluctuations and alterations in attention and arousal. Critically ill patients are at particularly high risk, and those that develop delirium are more likely to experience poor clinical outcomes such as prolonged duration of ICU and hospital length of stay, and increased mortality. Melatonin and melatonin agonists (MMA) have the potential to decrease the incidence and severity of delirium through their hypnotic and sedative-sparing effects, thus improving health-related outcomes. The objective of this review is to synthesize the available evidence pertaining to the efficacy and safety of MMA for the prevention and treatment of ICU delirium.MethodsWe will search Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and CINAHL to identify studies evaluating MMA in critically ill populations. We will also search http://apps.who.int/trialsearch for ongoing and unpublished studies and PROSPERO for registered reviews. We will not impose restrictions on language, date, or journal of publication. Authors will independently screen for eligible studies using pre-defined criteria; data extraction from eligible studies will be performed in duplicate. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Scale and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale will be used to assess the risk of bias and quality of randomized and non-randomized studies, respectively.",systematic_review

Abstract: AbstractIntroductionMelatonin is commonly used for sleep and jetlag at low doses. There is less documentation on the safety of higher doses which are being increasingly used for a wide variety of conditions. This systematic review aimed to investigate the safety of higher doses of melatonin in adults.MethodsWe searched Medline, Scopus, Embase and PsycINFO databases from study inception until December 2019 with convenience searches until October 2020. The inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials investigating high-dose melatonin (≥10mg) in human adults over 30 years of age. The outcomes examined were the number of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and withdrawals due to AEs. A meta-analysis was conducted on studies lasting 3 months or longer. Results79 studies were identified with a total of 3861 participants. 29 studies (37%) made no mention of the presence or absence of AEs. Only 4 studies met the pre-specified low-risk of bias criteria for meta-analysis. In that small subset, melatonin did not cause a detectable increase in SAEs (Rate Ratio=0.88 [0.52, 1.50], p=0.64) or withdrawals due to AEs (0.93 [0.24, 3.56], p=0.92), but did appear to increase the risk of AEs such as drowsiness, headache, and dizziness (1.40, [1.15, 1.69], p<0.001). DiscussionThere has been limited AE reporting from high-dose melatonin studies. Based on this limited evidence, melatonin appears to have a good safety profile. Better safety reporting in future long-term trials is needed to confirm this as our confidence limits were very wide due to the paucity of suitable data.",systematic_review

Abstract: ObjectiveTo systematically evaluate whether the melatonin supplementation could improve the embryo development and pregnancy outcomes of infertile women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ART).MethodsThis systematic review and meta-analysis followed the PRISMA guidelines and was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251003042). The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published before March 5, 2025 are included to evaluate the efficacy of melatonin on infertile women undergoing ART. Eligible studies reported at least one embryo development or pregnancy-related outcome. Primary outcome was clinical pregnancy rate; secondary outcomes including oocyte yield, fertilization rate, MII oocyte number, and high-quality embryo formation. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on stimulation protocols, melatonin dosage, and population characteristics. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and pooled effect sizes were calculated using fixed- or random-effects models depending on heterogeneity. Totally, eleven RCTs with a total of 1,481 participants were analyzed here.Data sourcesPubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library.ResultsMelatonin supplementation significantly improved clinical pregnancy rate (OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.22–2.07). Regarding embryo development, melatonin significantly increased the number of high-quality embryos (MD = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.07–0.79), MII oocyte (SMD=0.99, 95% CI: 0.29–1.69), and fertilization rates (OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.01–1.73). No significant difference was observed in oocyte yield (SMD = 0.45, 95% CI: −0.04 to 0.94).

Abstract: Melatonin is an important hormone for regulating mammalian circadian biology and cellular homeostasis. Recent evidence has shown that melatonin exerts anti-nociception effects in both animals and humans. However, according to clinical trials, the anti-nociception effects of melatonin are still controversial. The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the anti-nociception effects of melatonin premedication. The primary outcome was the effects of melatonin on pain intensity. The secondary outcomes included the number of patients with analgesic requirements, total analgesic consumption, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. In total, 19 studies were included in the current meta-analysis. The pooling data show that melatonin significantly decreased the pain intensity, as evidenced by the pain scores. Moreover, melatonin administration also reduced the proportion of patients with analgesic requirements and BDNF levels. However, the effects of melatonin on total analgesic consumption still require further confirmation. Collectively, the current meta-analysis supports the use of melatonin for anti-nociception.",systematic_review

Abstract: The treatments of choice in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA-receptor antagonists, although doubts remain about the therapeutic effectiveness of these drugs. Herbal medicine products have been used in the treatment of Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) but with various responses. The objective of this article was to review evidences from controlled studies in order to determine whether herbs can be useful in the treatment of cognitive disorders in the elderly. Randomized controlled studies assessing AD in individuals older than 65 years were identified through searches of MEDLINE, LILACS, Cochrane Library, dissertation Abstract (USA), ADEAR (Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials Database), National Research Register, Current Controlled trials, Centerwatch Trials Database and PsychINFO Journal Articles. The search combined the terms Alzheimer disease, dementia, cognition disorders, Herbal, Phytotherapy. The crossover results were evaluated by the Jadad's measurement scale. The systematic review identified two herbs and herbal formulations with therapeutic effects for the treatment of AD: Melissa officinalis, Salvia officinalis and Yi-Gan San and BDW (Ba Wei Di Huang Wan). Ginkgo biloba was identified in a meta-analysis study. All five herbs are useful for cognitive impairment of AD. M. officinalis and Yi-Gan San are also useful in agitation, for they have sedative effects.

Abstract: BackgroundThere has been a global increase in the use of herbal medicinal products (HMPs). About a quarter of UK adults use HMPs, bought over the counter by self-prescription and often not disclosed to healthcare professionals. Potential herb-drug interaction is a clinical concern, with older people at greater risk because of co-morbidities and slower clearance of pharmacologically active compounds. While there is a good understanding of general herbal medicine use by older people, less is known about the extent and implications of concurrent use with prescription medicines. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the prevalence, patterns, safety issues and other factors associated with concurrent prescription and herbal medicines use among older adults.Methods/designSystematic electronic searches of MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Web of Science and Cochrane from inception till present for studies reporting the concurrent use of prescription medicines with HMPs in older adults (≥65 years).

Abstract: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication following cardiac surgery, often leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Despite its prevalence, the role of acetaminophen in preventing AKI after cardiac surgery remains uncertain. This meta-analysis sought to clarify whether perioperative administration of acetaminophen could reduce the risk of postoperative AKI in adult patients undergoing cardiac procedures. To address this question, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by searching the MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Embase databases. Studies comparing the effects of perioperative acetaminophen to those of no acetaminophen in adult cardiac surgery patients were evaluated, with risk of bias assessed for each study. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted to strengthen the reliability of the findings. In total, 13 studies, including nine randomized controlled trials and four observational studies, involving 11,583 patients, were analyzed. The results showed that acetaminophen administration was associated with a lower incidence of AKI [OR 0.62 (95% CI 0.40–0.97), P = 0.04]. Additionally, acetaminophen use was linked to reduced in-hospital mortality, delirium rates, and shorter ICU stays, though it had no significant effect on overall hospital length of stay. These findings suggest that perioperative acetaminophen administration may play a protective role in reducing both AKI incidence and in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Until large multicenter randomized controlled trials confirm these results, acetaminophen may still be considered as a preventive measure for patients both before cardiopulmonary bypass initiation and in the postoperative period.",systematic_review

Abstract: Introduction: There are few reports summarizing the effectiveness of oral and intravenous (IV) acetylcysteine. We determined the proportion of acetaminophen poisoned patients who develop hepatotoxicity (serum transaminase > 1000 IU/L) when treated with oral and IV acetylcysteine.Methods: Studies were double abstracted by trained researchers. We determined the proportions of patients who developed hepatotoxicity for each route using a random effects model. Studies were further stratified by early and late treatment.Results: We screened 4,416 abstracts; 16 articles, including 5,164 patients, were included in the meta-analysis. The overall rate of hepatotoxicity for the oral and IV routes were 12.6% and 13.2%, respectively. Treatment delays are associated with a higher rate of hepatotoxicity.Conclusion: Studies report similar rates of hepatotoxicity for oral and IV acetylcysteine, but direct comparisons are lacking. While it is difficult to disentangle the effects of dose and duration from route, our findings suggest that the rates of hepatotoxicity are similar for oral and IV administration.",systematic_review

Abstract: IntroductionThere are discordant reports on N-acetylcysteine (NAC) efficacy in non-acetaminophen acute liver failure (ALF).AimTo determine whether NAC is beneficial in non-acetaminophen ALF.Material and methodsWe performed a systemic review and meta-analysis of published data to address the question. PubMed and MEDLINE were searched using the terms non-acetylcysteine and ALF due to non-acetaminophen, viral infection, drug-induced or autoimmune hepatitis. The primary outcome was overall mortality. Secondary outcomes were transplant-free survival and length of hospital stay. Risk ratios were calculated using a random model for meta-analysis.ResultsA total of 672 patients were included in this meta-analysis from 5 prospective studies (NAC group: n = 334; control group: n = 338). Viral hepatitis (45.8% vs. 32.8%) followed by drug-induced liver injury (24.6% vs. 27.5%), indeterminate cause (13.2% vs. 21.6%) and autoimmune hepatitis (6.6% vs. 8.9%) were the most common etiologies of ALF in the treatment group and control group respectively. Treatment with N-acetylcysteine improved the transplant-free survival significantly (55.1% vs. 28.1%; RR = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.33–0.94) whereas the overall survival was not improved with NAC (71% vs. 59.8%; RR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.48–1.09). The NAC treatment was associated with shorter hospital stay (standard difference in means (SMD) = –1.62; 95% CI: –1.84 to –1.40, p < 0.001).ConclusionsThe treatment of patients with acute liver failure with N-acetylcysteine improved transplant-free survival and length of stay.",systematic_review

Abstract: BACKGROUNDIn the management of postoperative pain following total joint arthroplasty (TJA), the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including acetaminophen, plays a key role in alleviating pain. However, the comparison between intravenous and oral acetaminophen administration in patients undergoing full joint replacement surgery remains controversial.AIMTo assess the effectiveness of intravenous and oral acetaminophen in alleviating pain and supporting rehabilitation following TJA.METHODSPubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library were comprehensively searched to identify cohort studies. The effects of intravenous and oral acetaminophen for managing pain and supporting rehabilitation following TJA were analysed using randomized controlled trials. PRISMA guidelines were followed. The effectiveness of the administration routes was compared based on visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at 24 and 48 h, total morphine usage within 24 h, and total duration of hospital stay.RESULTSThe meta-analysis included seven studies comparing intravenous acetaminophen groups and oral acetaminophen groups. The results demonstrated that oral acetaminophen was comparable to intravenous acetaminophen with regard to VAS scores at 24 h and 48 h (P = 0.76 and 0.08, respectively). The difference in total morphine use between the two groups was not significant (P = 0.22).",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundIbuprofen and acetaminophen are widely used as adjuvant analgesics for postoperative pain. This meta-analysis compared the effects of intravenous (IV) ibuprofen and acetaminophen on postoperative opioid consumption and pain intensity after general anesthesia.MethodsPubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify relevant studies published up to May 2023. Randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of perioperative IV ibuprofen and acetaminophen on postoperative opioid consumption and pain after general anesthesia were included in the meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA).ResultsEight studies with 494 participants were included. Compared to IV acetaminophen, IV ibuprofen significantly reduced 24 h opioid consumption, presented as morphine equivalents (mean difference [MD]: –6.01 mg, 95% CI [–8.60, –3.42], P < 0.00001, I2 = 55%), and pain scores (on a scale of 0–10) at 4–6 h (MD: –0.83, 95% CI [–1.29, –0.37], P = 0.0004, I2 = 65%) and 12 h (MD: –0.38, 95% CI [–0.68, –0.08], P = 0.01, I2 = 11%) postoperatively. These results were statistically significant in TSA. Pain scores at 24 h postoperatively and side effects were not significantly different between the two groups in the meta-analysis, and TSA revealed that the sample size was too small to adequately evaluate the effects, requiring further studies for conclusive results.ConclusionsPerioperative IV ibuprofen reduced 24 h opioid consumption and pain severity up to 12 h postoperatively compared to acetaminophen.",systematic_review

Abstract: Although widely believed by pediatricians and parents to be safe for use in infants and children when used as directed, increasing evidence indicates that early life exposure to paracetamol (acetaminophen) may cause long-term neurodevelopmental problems. Furthermore, recent studies in animal models demonstrate that cognitive development is exquisitely sensitive to paracetamol exposure during early development. In this study, evidence for the claim that paracetamol is safe was evaluated using a systematic literature search. Publications on PubMed between 1974 and 2017 that contained the keywords “infant” and either “paracetamol” or “acetaminophen” were considered. Of those initial 3096 papers, 218 were identified that made claims that paracetamol was safe for use with infants or children. From these 218, a total of 103 papers were identified as sources of authority for the safety claim. Conclusion: A total of 52 papers contained actual experiments designed to test safety, and had a median follow-up time of 48 h. None monitored neurodevelopment. Furthermore, no trial considered total exposure to drug since birth, eliminating the possibility that the effects of drug exposure on long-term neurodevelopment could be accurately assessed. On the other hand, abundant and sufficient evidence was found to conclude that paracetamol does not induce acute liver damage in babies or children when used as directed.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundThe American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommends that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) may be beneficial in non-acetaminophen-related drug-induced liver injury. A subsequent review and analysis reported the current evidence to be inconclusive. Herein, we present an updated review and meta-analysis.MethodsWe evaluated prospective, retrospective and randomized controlled trials that compared outcomes in patients of all ages with acute liver failure (defined as abnormal liver enzymes along with elevated international normalized ratio >1.5, with or without hepatic encephalopathy) receiving NAC with the outcomes in a control group. The primary outcome was to compare the overall survival in the 2 groups. Secondary outcomes included difference in length of hospital stay, transplant-free survival, and post-transplant survival.ResultsSeven studies (N=883) that met the inclusion criteria were included in this analysis. The mean age of patients in the NAC group was 21.22 years compared with 23.62 years in the control group. The odds of overall survival were significantly higher in the NAC group than in controls (odds ratio [OR] 1.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-2.41). Post-transplant survival (OR 2.44, 95%CI 1.11-5.37) and transplant-free survival were also better in the NAC group than in the control group (OR 2.85, 95%CI 2.11-3.85).

The evidence for treatment of DILI in children is scarce.ObjectiveWe aimed to comprehensively review the available literature on the therapies for both acetaminophen overdose (APAP) and idiosyncratic DILI in the paediatric population.MethodsWe included original articles conducted in a paediatric population (< 18 years) in which a therapeutic intervention was described to manage APAP or idiosyncratic DILI. Findings were summarized based on age groups (preterm newborn neonates, term and post-term neonates, infants, children and adolescents).ResultsOverall, 25 publications (fifteen case reports, six case series and four retrospective cohort studies) were included, including a total of 140 paediatric DILI cases, from preterm newborn neonates to adolescents. N-acetylcysteine was used to treat 19 APAP cases. N-acetylcysteine (n = 14), ursodeoxycholic acid (n = 3), corticosteroids (n = 31), carnitine (n = 16) and the combination of glycyrrhizin, reduced glutathione, polyene phosphatidylcholine and S-adenosylmethionine (n = 31) were the therapeutic options for treating idiosyncratic DILI. The molecular adsorbent recirculating system was used in the management of either APAP (n = 4) or idiosyncratic DILI (n = 2), while 20 paediatric ALF cases received continuous renal replacement therapy.ConclusionsThis systematic review identified DILI in the paediatric population who have received specific treatment. These interventions appear to be mainly extrapolated from low-quality evidence from the adult population.",systematic_review

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to review the published papers investigating maternal acetaminophen (AP) use during pregnancy and its effect on the offspring's neurodevelopment, particularly autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Acetaminophen is an over-the-counter analgesic and antipyretic considered safe in pregnancy. Recent studies have found an association between acetaminophen and immune system alterations like asthma and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. We used online databases (PubMed/Medline/PubMed Central, Science Direct, and Google Scholar) to search the studies relevant to our topic. We screened the papers by titles, abstracts, and then full-text availability. The screened articles were checked for eligibility using relevant quality assessment tools for each study design, extracting and analyzing the data. We finalized 30 studies after the screening; 14 were ineligible. Our final selection included 16 high-quality papers - 13 prospective cohort studies, two review articles, and one meta-analysis.We found a wide range of neurodevelopmental outcomes in our data collection. So, we included autism spectrum disorders, intelligent quotient (IQ), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), isolated language, attention and executive function, communication, behavior, and psychomotor development. All studies showed an association between acetaminophen use and listed neurodevelopmental outcomes. Long-term use, increased dose, and frequency were associated with a stronger association. We extracted collective evidence from 16 studies suggesting acetaminophen's role in developing adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.",systematic_review

Abstract: AbstractBackground:This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficiency and safety of intravenous acetaminophen as an adjunct to multimodal analgesia for pain control after total joint arthroplasty (TJA).Methods:PubMed, Embase, Web of science, Medline, and Cochrane library databases were systematically searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs were included. Fixed/random effect model was used according to the heterogeneity tested by I2 statistic. Meta-analysis was performed using Stata 11.0 software.Results:Four studies including 865 patients met the inclusion criteria. The present meta-analysis indicated that there were significant differences between groups in terms of pain scores at 24 hours (weighted mean difference [WMD] = −0.926, 95% confidence interval [CI]: −1.171 to −0.681, P = .000), 48 hours (WMD = −0.905, 95% CI: −1.198 to −0.612, P = .000), and 72 hours (WMD = −0.279, 95% CI: −0.538 to −0.021, P = .034). Significant differences were found regarding opioid consumption at 24 hours (WMD = −4.043, 95% CI: −5.041 to −3.046, P = .000), 48 hours (WMD = −5.665, 95% CI: −7.383 to −3.947, P = .000), and 72 hours (WMD = −6.338, 95% CI: −7.477 to −5.199, P = .000).Conclusion:Intravenous acetaminophen was efficacious for reducing postoperative pain and opioid consumption than the placebo following total joint arthroplasty.

Abstract: IntroductionAcetaminophen poisoning is commonly treated by emergency physicians. First-line therapy is N-acetylcysteine (NAC), traditionally administered intravenously via a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved three-bag protocol in which each bag has a unique concentration and infusion duration. Recently, simplified, off-label two-bag NAC infusion protocols have become more common. The purpose of this review is to summarize the effectiveness and safety of two-bag NAC.MethodsWe undertook a comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE from inception to December 13, 2022, for articles describing human acetaminophen poisonings treated with two-bag NAC, defined as any regimen involving two discrete infusions in two separate bags. Outcomes included effectiveness (measured by incidence of liver injury); incidence of non-allergic anaphylactoid reactions (NAAR); gastrointestinal, cutaneous, and systemic reactions; treatments for NAARs; incidence of NAC-related medication errors; and delays or interruptions in NAC administration.ResultsTwelve articles met final inclusion, 10 of which compared two-bag NAC to the three-bag regimen. Nine articles evaluated the two-bag/20-hour regimen, a simplified version of the FDA-approved three-bag regimen in which the traditional first and second bags are combined into a single four-hour infusion. Nine articles assessed comparative effectiveness of two-bag NAC in terms of liver injury, most commonly assessed for by incidence of hepatotoxicity (aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase >1,000 international units per liter). No difference in liver injury was observed between two-bag and three-bag regimens.",systematic_review

In seven articles evaluating treatment for NAARs (antihistamines, corticosteroids, epinephrine), all showed that patients received fewer medications for NAARs with two-bag NAC. Three articles evaluated NAC-related medication errors; two demonstrated no difference, while one study evaluating only children showed fewer errors with two-bag NAC. Two studies evaluated delays and/or interruptions in NAC infusions; both favored two-bag NAC.ConclusionFor patients with acetaminophen poisoning, two-bag NAC regimens appear to have similar outcomes to the traditional three-bag regimen in terms of liver injury. Two-bag NAC regimens are associated with fewer adverse events and fewer treatments for those events than the three-bag regimen and fewer interruptions in antidotal therapy.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundAlthough intravenous (IV) acetaminophen (AAP) may help reduce severe postoperative pain and opioid use after cardiovascular surgery, its effectiveness must be further validated. Therefore, the authors aimed to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of perioperative IV AAP in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery by conducting this meta-analysis.MethodsA comprehensive literature search was conducted of PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for studies published up to March 21, 2024. Six randomized controlled trials comparing IV AAP with a placebo in cardiovascular surgery were included. The mean difference (MD) was calculated to estimate pooled effect sizes. The primary outcome was opioid consumption, measured in morphine equivalent dose, and the secondary outcome was postoperative pain score.ResultsPostoperative opioid consumption was significantly reduced with IV AAP than it was with a placebo (MD −21.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] −38.41 to −4.95, P = 0.011). Significant reductions in postoperative pain scores were observed at 6 hours (MD −0.76, 95% CI −1.43 to −0.10, P = 0.025) and 24 hours (MD −0.63, 95% CI −1.02 to −0.25, P = 0.001) after surgery. However, these reductions did not meet clinically meaningful thresholds. No significant differences were observed at 12, 18, and 48 hours postoperatively.ConclusionsIV AAP was more effective than a placebo for postoperative adjunct analgesia in patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundIbuprofen, a well-known analgesic, is commonly used as a component of a multimodal analgesic approach for postoperative pain. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate whether a single-dose preoperative intravenous ibuprofen can reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption.MethodsPubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), and Web of Science databases were searched to identify relevant studies published up to May 2020. Randomized controlled trials comparing preoperative single-dose intravenous ibuprofen effect with the control group on postoperative pain and opioid consumption after surgery under general anesthesia were included.ResultsSix studies involving 366 participants were included. Single-dose administration of intravenous ibuprofen preoperatively significantly reduced postoperative pain score on a scale of 0-10 at 1 h (MD: -1.64, 95% CI [-2.56, -0.72], P < 0.001, I2 = 95%), at 4-6 h (MD: -1.17, 95% CI [-2.09, -0.26], P < 0.001, I2 = 94%), and 24 h (MD: -0.58, 95% CI [-0.99, -0.18], P < 0.001, I2 = 90%). Cumulative opioid consumption, presented as fentanyl equivalents, was also reduced significantly in the ibuprofen group compared to placebo group until postoperative 4-6 h (MD: -56.35 μg, 95% CI [-101.10, -11.60], P < 0.001, I2 = 91%) and 24 h (MD: -131.39 μg, 95% CI [-224.56, -38.21], P < 0.001, I2 = 95%).ConclusionsPreoperative single-dose intravenous ibuprofen can reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption until 24 h postoperatively. Considering the high heterogeneity and small number of studies included, care should be taken when generalizing these findings.",systematic_review

Abstract: Objective:This systematic review aims to evaluate the effects of ibuprofen compared to other drugs on the risk and intensity of postoperative pain resulting from endodontic treatment in adult patients.Methods:A systematic search was carried out through Medline databases (Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, Lilacs, and BBO). There was no restriction on the publication year or idiom. The gray literature was explored. The Periodicos Capes Theses Databases and ProQuest Dissertations were also searched, as well as the unpublished and ongoing trials registry and the IADR abstracts (1990–2016). Solely randomized clinical trials that compared the risk or intensity of pain resulting from endodontic treatment in adult patients were included in this systematic review. The risk of bias of the articles was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool. A random-effect meta-analysis was conducted for ibuprofen versus placebo and ibuprofen versus other drugs at 6, 8, and 24 hours. The GRADE approach was used to assess the quality of the evidence.Results:A total of 1132 studies were identified, and only seven meet the eligibility criteria. No difference between the groups was detected in any of the meta-analysis. An exception was observed when one study was removed from the meta-analysis of pain intensity at 24 hours for ibuprofen versus placebo, favoring ibuprofen (SMD −0.67; 95% CI −1.05 to −0.17). The quality of evidence in all meta-analyses was graded as low or very low.Conclusion:Results of the present systematic review indicate that there is no clear evidence supporting that preoperative ibuprofen is better than other drugs in reducing the risk and intensity of postendodontic pain.",systematic_review

Abstract: AbstractThis study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple or single‐dosage intravenous ibuprofen (IVIB) in managing postoperative pain and fever in adults who are unable to take oral medications. A systematic review and meta‐analysis was conducted based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IVIB with placebo or other analgesic and antipyretic medications for postoperative pain and fever management. Data were collected from 8 main databases from the inception to June 2022. Risk of bias assessment was performed, and the GRADE methodology was used to assess the certainty of pooled evidence. Primary outcomes included visual analogue scale (VAS) scores within 24 h postoperative and reduction of temperature. Meta‐analyses were conducted to calculate the mean difference (MD) or risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs. As a result, a total of twenty‐three RCTs with 3716 participants were included. For postoperative pain, with moderate‐to‐low certainty evidence, IVIB was associated with lower postoperative VAS scores than placebo, with MD ranging from −3.53 (95% CI, −4.32 to −2.75) at 0 min to −0.96 (95% CI, −1.35 to −0.57) at 24 h. Compared with intravenous acetaminophen, IVIB demonstrated lower VAS scores (MD, −1.54 at 0 min; −0.36 at 24 h). For fever, IVIB showed satisfactory antipyretic efficiency in a short period of time, but no difference was observed between IVIB and intravenous acetaminophen. IVIB was well‐tolerated for both pain and fever management. In conclusion, moderate‐to‐low certainty evidence supports the use of IVIB for adults with postoperative pain and fever who are unable to take oral medications.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundIbuprofen is one of the most commonly used analgesic and antipyretic drugs in children. However, its potential causal role in childhood asthma pathogenesis remains uncertain. In this systematic review, we assessed the association between ibuprofen administration in children and the risk of developing or exacerbating asthma.MethodsWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to May 2022, with no language limits; searched relevant reviews; and performed citation searching. We included studies of any design that were primary empirical peer-reviewed publications, where ibuprofen use in children 0–18 years was reported. Screening was performed in duplicate by blinded review. In total, 24 studies met our criteria. Data were extracted according to PRISMA guidelines, and the risk of bias was assessed using RoB2 and NOS tools. Quantitative data were pooled using fixed effect models, and qualitative data were pooled using narrative synthesis. Primary outcomes were asthma or asthma-like symptoms. The results were grouped according to population (general, asthmatic, and ibuprofen-hypersensitive), comparator type (active and non-active) and follow-up duration (short- and long-term).ResultsComparing ibuprofen with active comparators, there was no evidence of a higher risk associated with ibuprofen over both the short and long term in either the general or asthmatic population. Comparing ibuprofen use with no active alternative over a short-term follow-up, ibuprofen may provide protection against asthma-like symptoms in the general population when used to ease symptoms of fever or bronchiolitis.",systematic_review

Abstract: IntroductionPatients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or other rheumatic diseases say that pain and stiffness are symptoms affecting their quality of life. Ketoprofen and ibuprofen are the most commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce inflammation and manage mild-to-moderate pain. The aim of this new systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was to compare the clinical efficacy of ketoprofen and ibuprofen in patients with RA.MethodsThe MEDLINE and EMBASE scientific databases were systematically searched from their inception to November 2020 to identify RCTs directly comparing the recommended therapeutic doses of oral ketoprofen (50–200 mg/day) with ibuprofen (600–1800 mg/day) for RA pain relief. The meta-analysis was made using the standardized mean differences (SMD) of each of the identified RCTs using a fixed effects model.ResultsFour RCTs involving 456 patients met the inclusion criteria. The results of the meta-analysis showed a statistically significant difference in efficacy in favor of ketoprofen (0.33, 95% CI 0.14–0.52, p = 0.0005) at all point-estimates of the mean-weighted size effect. The heterogeneity test for the efficacy outcome (the hypothesis was χ2 = 3.57%, df = 3, p value = 0.31 and the chance of a test effect was 3.49, p = 0.0005) was not significant, and this was confirmed by a Higgins percentage of 16%.",systematic_review

Abstract: AbstractBackground:Needling and ibuprofen are often used clinically to treat primary dysmenorrhea (PD). However, the difference between the efficacy and safety of the treatment of PD is not clear. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of simple-needling for PD patients through a comparison with ibuprofen.Methods:A comprehensive search of 7 electronic databases and relevant medical journals, from the establishment of the publication to December 2020. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to evaluate the methodological quality of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that met the inclusion criteria, and a meta-analysis was performed with the Review Manager version (RevMan version 5.3).Results:Twenty three RCTs were included. The meta-analysis reported that simple-needling groups had better than ibuprofen groups on cure rate (relative risk = 2.29, 95% CI [1.96, 2.68], P < .00001) and total effective rate (relative risk = 1.24, 95% CI [1.19, 1.29], P < .00001) and VAS score (MD = −1.24, 95% CI [−1.92, −0.55], P = .0004). Seven studies reported adverse events, of which 4 studies had mild adverse events.Conclusion:Simple-needling is superior to ibuprofen treatment in terms of clinical efficacy and improvement of pain symptoms. A small number of studies reported whether simple-needling produced adverse events, so there is not enough evidence to support the safety of simple-needling in the treatment of PD.PROSPERO registration number:CRD42021233403",systematic_review

Abstract: This study aimed to systematically review the literature to assess the effect of preemptive intravenous ibuprofen on pain reduction after lower third molar surgery. Nine databases (PubMed, Scopus, LILACS, SciELO, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, Open Gray, and Open Thesis) were used as sources of research, including “grey literature.” The protocol was registered in PROSPERO. Only randomized clinical trials evaluating the effects of preemptive intravenous ibuprofen on pain during and immediately after the extraction of lower third molars were included, without restrictions of year and language. Two reviewers independently performed the study selection, data extraction, and assessment of the risk of bias. The “Joanna Briggs Institute for Randomized Controlled Trials” tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Each study was categorized according to the percentage of positive responses to the questions corresponding to the assessment instrument. The results were measured narratively/descriptively. The initial search resulted in 3,257 records, of which only three studies (n=150 participants) met the eligibility criteria and were included in the qualitative analysis. All studies were published in 2019. The risk of bias ranged from low to moderate. Two studies found significant pain reduction within 48 h after the procedure. In conclusion, the use of preemptive intravenous ibuprofen for extracting third molars reduces pain and analgesic consumption after the surgical procedure.",systematic_review

Abstract: Background:This research aimed to assess the efficacy of ibuprofen and low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in pain reduction following the placement of elastomeric separators, utilizing a network meta-analysis (NMA) to synthesize data from relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Our objective was to determine the most effective method for pain management in orthodontic patients.Methods:This study was registered with International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (registration number: CRD42025640519). A comprehensive literature search was conducted across various databases up to January 19, 2025, to identify RCTs evaluating the impact of ibuprofen and LLLT on pain intensity following orthodontic separator placement. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A NMA was performed to combine direct and indirect comparisons, ranking the interventions based on their effectiveness in alleviating pain at 6 hours and 24 hours after orthodontic separator placement.Results:Twenty-three studies with 1007 participants were included in the NMA. Both ibuprofen and LLLT demonstrated significantly greater reductions in pain intensity compared to control or placebo groups at all assessed time points. For ibuprofen, pain reduction was observed at 6-hour with a mean difference (MD) of –1.93 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of –2.93 to –0.93, and at 24-hour with an MD of –1.63 (95% CI: –2.58 to –0.68). For LLLT, the MD at 6-hour was –1.46 (95% CI: –2.28 to –0.64), and at 24-hour, the MD was –1.84 (95% CI: –2.52 to –1.16).",systematic_review

There is still no consensus as to what constitutes the best analgesic for MSK pain in children. However, ibuprofen is reported to be the most commonly prescribed analgesic and is considered the standard first-line treatment for MSK injury pain in children, even if it is argued that it provides inadequate relief for many patients. The purpose of this study was to review the most recent literature to assess the efficacy of ibuprofen for pain relief in MSK injuries in children evaluated in the ED. We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials on pharmacological interventions in children and adolescents under 19 years of age with MSK injuries according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The primary outcome was the risk ratio for successful reduction in pain scores. Six studies met the inclusion criteria and provided data on 1028 children. A meta-analysis was not performed since studies were not comparable due to the different analgesic treatment used. No significant difference in term of main pain score reduction between all the analgesics used in the included studies was noted. Patients who received oral opioids had side effects more frequently when compared to children who received ibuprofen. The combination of effect on pain relief and tolerability would suggest ibuprofen as the initial drug of choice in providing relief from mild-to-moderate MSK pain in children in the ED. The results obtained in this review and current research suggest that there’s no straightforward statistically significant evidence of the optimal analgesic agent to be used.",systematic_review

In fact, despite the non-significant pain reduction as compared to children who received opioids, there are less side effect associated to ibuprofen within studies. The wide range of primary outcomes measured in respect of pain scores and timing of recorded measures warrants a future standardization of study designs.",systematic_review

Abstract: AbstractBackground:Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is the effect when people accessing high altitude in a short period of time. As a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, ibuprofen could alleviate the symptoms of AMS. However, whether it can prevent AMS or not is still controversial. It is necessary to perform a meta-analysis to evaluate the role of ibuprofen in AMS prophylaxis.Methods:PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) will be searched for the relevant published studies that explored the value of ibuprofen in AMS prophylaxis from inception to October 2020. The data will be independently extracted by 2 researchers. Risk of bias will be evaluated based on Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Heterogeneity among the included studies will be evaluated by χ2 and I2 values. The meta-analysis was conducted by RevMan software version 5.3.Results:This study will evaluate the role of ibuprofen in AMS prophylaxis.Conclusion:This study will summarize the current evidence of ibuprofen in AMS prophylaxis, which could further guide the recommendation in prevention of AMS.Open Science Framework (OSF) registration number: October 8, 2020. osf.io/n3mjt.",systematic_review

Abstract: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are popularly used in the management of acute postoperative pain. Intravenous (IV) ketorolac has been used for several years for this purpose. Recently, IV ibuprofen has been introduced for the management of postoperative pain. This review aims to compare the efficacy of these two NSAIDs in managing acute postoperative pain. After registering the protocol in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), databases like PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Ovid were searched using relevant keywords. Twenty-four-hour opioid consumption was the primary outcome. Pain scores, patient satisfaction, rescue analgesia requirements, and adverse events were the secondary outcomes assessed. Out of 124 articles that were retrieved, six articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The Risk of Bias 2 (RoB-2) was used for risk of bias assessment, Review Manager (RevMan) was used for a quantitative meta-analysis, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to assess the strength of evidence. The risk of bias was high in all categories. The 24-hour opioid requirement, which was the primary outcome, was comparable between both groups (mean difference: -4.72; 95% CI: -5.65, -3.80; P=0.79), with significant heterogeneity (I2=93%). The secondary outcomes were comparable among both groups. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) strength of evidence was moderate for the pain score at movement and low to very low for other outcomes.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundParacetamol and ibuprofen are the most commonly used medications for fever and pain management in children. While the efficacy appears similar with both drugs, there are contradictory findings related to adverse events. In particular, incidence of wheezing and asthma among children taking paracetamol compared to ibuprofen, remain unsettled.MethodsWe conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared wheezing and asthma exacerbations in children taking paracetamol versus ibuprofen. A comprehensive search was conducted in five databases. RCTs reporting on cases of wheezing or asthma exacerbations in infants or children after the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen were included. The pooled effect size was estimated using the Peto’s odds ratio.ResultsFive RCTs with 85,095 children were included in the analysis. The pooled estimate (OR 1.05; 95%CI 0.76–1.46) revealed no difference in the odds of developing asthma or presenting an exacerbation of asthma in children who received paracetamol compared to ibuprofen. When the analysis was restricted to RCTs that examined the incidence of asthma exacerbation or wheezing, the pooled estimate remained similar (OR 1.01; 95%CI 0.63–1.64).",systematic_review

Abstract: No data addressing issues concerning disparities in participant and trial characteristics and trial outcome reporting have been established in clinical trials for H1-antihistamine-refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). To better harmonize and compare the different treatment interventions, we systematically evaluated the overall landscape of pharmacological treatments for H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU clinical trials published between 2000 and 2021. This systematic review included 23 randomized clinical trials involving 2480 participants from 22 countries. We found significant increases in the number of globally published and newly tested drugs, especially biologic drugs. Regarding relatively small trials, we found that people living with H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU who were identified as members of minority groups (non-white population), populations of regions other than North America/Europe, and populations of low- to lower/upper-middle-income countries are underrepresented. Most trials were designed to evaluate treatment efficacy and safety profiles; however, less than half of the included trials reported the patient’s perspective in terms of patient-reported outcomes. Disparities in outcome reporting, including clinimetric tools for assessing treatment response and outcome sets, were observed. To close the evidence gap in H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU trials, strategies for improving trial and participant enrollment and standardizing core outcome sets for trial reporting are needed.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundAs a new generation antihistamine, fexofenadine has been widely used in allergic diseases. However, there is still a lack of collective evidence regarding the antihistamine effects and safety profiles of fexofenadine relative to other antihistamine drugs and placebo. Therefore, we aimed to systematically evaluate the antihistamine effects and safety of fexofenadine.MethodsAn electronic literature search of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed using Embase, Cochrane and PubMed from establishment to January 1st, 2018. RCTs comparing the antihistamine effects or safety (adverse events, sedative effects, and cognitive/psychomotor function) of fexofenadine with either other antihistamines or placebo for healthy subjects and patients with allergy were selected.ResultsFifty-one studies of 14,551 participants met the inclusion criteria. When compared with the first-generation antihistamines, fexofenadine produced significantly lower adverse events frequency (OR = 0.446; 95% CI: 0.214 to 0.929, P = 0.031), significantly lower sedative effects frequency (OR = 0.265; 95% CI: 0.072 to 0.976, P = 0.046) and significantly less change of all cognitive/psychomotor function. When compared with the second-generation antihistamines, fexofenadine produced significantly marginal sedative effects (OR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93; P = 0.02) and significantly less change of most of the cognitive/psychomotor function. When compared with placebo, fexofenadine produced more significant antihistamine effects.ConclusionsFexofenadine has a positive antihistamine effect, which is probably no worse than the second-generation antihistamines.",systematic_review

There is lack of data to support that fexofenadine has a better overall safety profile compared to the second-generation antihistamines, however, some presently available evidence on sedative effects and certain aspects of cognitive/psychomotor function favors fexofenadine.

Abstract: H-1 antihistamines are commonly used in dermatological practice for itch and urticaria control. The widespread expression of H-1 receptor on different cells in the skin and various biologic functions of H-1 antihistamines indicate the possible treatment potentials of H-1 antihistamines in dermatology. A literature search was performed on PubMed and Embase, targeting articles reporting use of antihistamine for purposes other than itch and urticaria control in dermatological practice. Several off-label usages of antihistamines were identified, including alopecia, acne, Darier disease, eosinophilic dermatoses, paraneoplastic dermatoses, psoriasis, lichen nitidus, radiation dermatitis, skin dysesthesia, and cutaneous malignancies. Additional benefits were observed when H-1 antihistamines were used either alone or in combination with other therapeutic modalities. Although various novel uses of H-1 antihistamines have been uncovered, the evidence level of most included studies is weak. Further randomized control trials are warranted to better evaluate the efficacy and dosage of H-1 antihistamine for dermatological disorders.",systematic_review

Abstract: IntroductionNarrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) phototherapy has been used for the treatment of chronic urticaria (CU), but the clinical efficacy of this treatment modality requires further evidence. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NB-UVB as add-on therapy in the treatment of CU.MethodsA literature search was conducted in the Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, CBM, VIP and WanFang databases up to October 2020. A total of nine studies involving 713 participants met the inclusion criteria.ResultsTwo trials showed a significant difference in the Urticaria Activity Score between therapy with NB-UVB + antihistamines and that with antihistamines alone (mean difference 8.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.78–10.68, p < 0.00001). Six trials (563 participants) showed a significant benefit of NB-UVB as add-on therapy to antihistamines in the total effective rate (risk ratio [RR] 1.56, 95% CI 1.39–1.75, p < 0.00001). In terms of adverse events, no statistically significant differences were found for NB-UVB + antihistamines versus antihistamines alone (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.67–1.79, p = 0.71). Combination therapy of NB-UVB + antihistamines yielded a significantly lower risk of recurrence (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.14–0.44, p < 0.00001).ConclusionOur meta-analysis suggests that combination therapy of NB-UVB + antihistamines is significantly more effective in treating CU than antihistamines alone.",systematic_review
