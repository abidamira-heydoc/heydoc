Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Headache is the most prevalent neurological manifestation in adults and one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. In children and adolescents, headaches are arguably responsible for a remarkable impact on physical and psychological issues, yet high-quality evidence is scarce. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched cross-sectional and cohort studies in Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases from January 1988 to June 2022 to identify the prevalence of headaches in 8-18 years old individuals. The risk of bias was examined with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scale. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of pediatric headache. Subgroup analyses based on headache subtypes were also conducted. RESULTS: Out of 5,486 papers retrieved electronically, we identified 48 studies that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of primary headaches was 11% for migraine overall [95%CI: 9-14%], 8% for migraine without aura (MwoA) [95%CI: 5-12%], 3% for migraine with aura (MwA) [95%CI:2-4%] and 17% for tension-type headache (TTH) [95% CI: 12-23%]. The pooled prevalence of overall primary headache in children and adolescents was 62% [95% CI: 53-70%], with prevalence in females and males of 38% [95% CI: 16-66%] and 27% [95% CI: 11-53%] respectively. After the removal of studies ranked as low-quality according to the JBI scale, prevalence rates were not substantially different. Epidemiological data on less common primary headaches, such as trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, were lacking. CONCLUSION: We found an overall remarkably high prevalence of primary headaches in children and adolescents, even if flawed by a high degree of heterogeneity.",research

Abstract: This systematic review summarizes the existing data on headache and pregnancy with a scope on clinical headache phenotypes, treatment of headaches in pregnancy and effects of headache medications on the child during pregnancy and breastfeeding, headache related complications, and diagnostics of headache in pregnancy. Headache during pregnancy can be both primary and secondary, and in the last case can be a symptom of a life-threatening condition. The most common secondary headaches are stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pituitary tumor, choriocarcinoma, eclampsia, preeclampsia, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. Migraine is a risk factor for pregnancy complications, particularly vascular events. Data regarding other primary headache conditions are still scarce. Early diagnostics of the disease manifested by headache is important for mother and fetus life. It is especially important to identify ""red flag symptoms"" suggesting that headache is a symptom of a serious disease. In order to exclude a secondary headache additional studies can be necessary: electroencephalography, ultrasound of the vessels of the head and neck, brain MRI and MR angiography with contrast ophthalmoscopy and lumbar puncture. During pregnancy and breastfeeding the preferred therapeutic strategy for the treatment of primary headaches should always be a non-pharmacological one. Treatment should not be postponed as an undermanaged headache can lead to stress, sleep deprivation, depression and poor nutritional intake that in turn can have negative consequences for both mother and baby. Therefore, if non-pharmacological interventions seem inadequate, a well-considered choice should be made concerning the use of medication, taking into account all the benefits and possible risks.",research

Authors: Pietro Bini, David Hohenschurz-Schmidt, Vincenzo Masullo et al. Published: Nov 2022

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cervicogenic headache is a secondary headache, and manual therapy is one of the most common treatment choices for this and other types of headache. Nonetheless, recent guidelines on the management of cervicogenic headache underlined the lack of trials comparing manual and exercise therapy to sham or no-treatment controls. The main objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effectiveness of different forms of manual and exercise therapy in people living with cervicogenic headache, when compared to other treatments, sham, or no treatment controls. METHODS: Following the PRISMA guidelines, the literature search was conducted until January 2022 on MEDLINE, CENTRAL, DOAJ, and PEDro. Randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of manual or exercise therapy on patients with cervicogenic headache with headache intensity or frequency as primary outcome measures were included. Study selection, data extraction and Risk of Bias (RoB) assessment were done in duplicate. GRADE was used to assess the quality of the evidence. RESULTS: Twenty studies were included in the review, with a total of 1439 patients. Common interventions were spinal manipulation, trigger point therapy, spinal mobilization, scapulo-thoracic and cranio-cervical exercises. Meta-analysis was only possible for six manual therapy trials with sham comparators. Data pooling showed moderate-to-large effects in favour of manual therapy for headache frequency and intensity at short-term, small-to-moderate for disability at short-term, small-to-moderate for headache intensity and small for headache frequency at long-term.",research

However, a sensitivity meta-analysis on low-RoB trials showed moderate-quality evidence supporting the use of spinal manipulation compared to sham interventions. More high-quality trials are necessary to make stronger recommendations, ideally based on methodological recommendations that enhance comparability between studies.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Tension-type headache is the most common primary headache, with a high prevalence and a considerable socioeconomic impact. Manual physical therapy techniques are widely used in the clinical field to treat the symptoms associated with tension-type headache. This systematic review aims to determine the effectiveness of manual and non-invasive therapies in the treatment of patients with tension-type headache. DEVELOPMENT: We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials in the following databases: Brain, PubMed, Web of Science, PEDro, Scopus, CINAHL, and Science Direct. Ten randomised controlled trials were included for analysis. According to these studies, manual therapy improves symptoms, increasing patients' well-being and improving the outcome measures analysed. CONCLUSIONS: Manual therapy has positive effects on pain intensity, pain frequency, disability, overall impact, quality of life, and craniocervical range of motion in adults with tension-type headache. None of the techniques was found to be superior to the others; combining different techniques seems to be the most effective approach.",research

Abstract: We here present evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of migraine. These guidelines, created by the Italian Society for the Study of Headache and the International Headache Society, aim to offer clear, actionable recommendations to healthcare professionals. They incorporate evidence-based recommendations from randomized controlled trials and expert-based opinions. The guidelines follow the GRADE approach for assessing the quality of evidence. The guideline development involved a systematic review of literature across multiple databases, adherence to Cochrane review methods, and a structured framework for data extraction and interpretation. Although the guidelines provide a robust foundation for migraine treatment, they also highlight gaps in current research, such as the paucity of head-to-head drug comparisons and the need for long-term outcome studies. These guidelines serve as a resource to standardize migraine treatment and promote high-quality care across different healthcare settings.",research

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Migraine headaches are chronic neurological diseases that reduce the quality of life by causing severe headaches and autonomic nervous system dysfunction, such as facial flushing, nasal stuffiness, and sweating. Their major treatment methods include medication and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT has been used for pain treatment and various psychogenic neurological diseases by reducing pain, disability, and emotional disorders caused by symptoms of mental illness and improving the understanding of mental health. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CBT in treating migraines. Materials and Methods: Seven electronic databases were searched from the date of inception to December 2020. Randomized controlled studies (RCTs) using CBT as an intervention for migraine were included. The primary outcome of this study was to determine the frequency of migraines and the intensity of migraines on Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the frequency of drug use, Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS), and Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) index. The two authors independently conducted the data extraction and quality assessment of the included RCTs, and conducted meta-analysis with RevMan V.5.4. Results: Among the 373 studies, 11 RCTs were included in this systematic review. Seven out of the 11 RCTs were conducted in the USA, and four were conducted in the UK, Germany, Iran, and Italy, respectively. Headache frequency and MIDAS scores were statistically significant reduced. In the subgroup analysis, headache strength was significantly reduced. Two of the included studies reported adverse effects, including worsening of migraine intensity and frequency, respiratory symptoms, and vivid memory of a traumatic event.",research

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To provide updated evidence-based recommendations about when to obtain neuroimaging in patients with migraine. METHODS: Articles were included in the systematic review if they studied adults 18 and over who were seeking outpatient treatment for any type of migraine and who underwent neuroimaging (MRI or CT). Medline, Web of Science, and Cochrane Clinical Trials were searched from 1973 to August 31, 2018. Reviewers identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the evidence in duplicate. We assessed study quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 2269 publications. Twenty three articles met inclusion criteria and were included in the final review. The majority of studies were retrospective cohort or cross-sectional studies. There were 4 prospective observational studies. Ten studies evaluated the utility of CT only, 9 MRI only, and 4 evaluated both. Common abnormalities included chronic ischemia or atrophy with CT and MRI scanning, and non-specific white matter lesions with MRI. Clinically meaningful abnormalities requiring intervention were relatively rare. Clinically significant neuroimaging abnormalities in patients with headaches consistent with migraine without atypical features or red flags appeared no more common than in the general population. RECOMMENDATIONS: There is no necessity to do neuroimaging in patients with headaches consistent with migraine who have a normal neurologic examination, and there are no atypical features or red flags present.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pharmacological treatment is the primary approach in chronic migraine (CM), although non-drug interventions such as physical therapy are used as adjunct treatments. We aimed to review the efficacy of physical therapy and rehabilitation approaches for CM and their impact on quality of life (QoL) and disability. METHODS: This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with CM. The primary outcomes were changes in intensity, frequency, duration of headache, disability, and QoL. Methodological quality was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. Data synthesis and quantitative analysis were conducted on relevant studies. RESULTS: Seven RCTs were included in the narrative review, and five of them were eligible for quantitative analysis. Aerobic exercise (AE), osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), occipital transcutaneous electrical stimulation (OTES), acupressure, hydrotherapy, instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM), facial proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (FPNF), and connective tissue massage (CTM) were used in CM. AE combined with pharmacological therapy reduced the frequency, duration, and intensity of headache. OMT combined with medication improved QoL and reduced disability, intensity of pain, and migraine days per month. Hydrotherapy combined with medication also resulted in improvements in the intensity of headache, frequency, and overall QoL. IASTM and OTES reduced the intensity of headache, alleviated neck pain, and improved QoL, although there were conflicting findings following OTES alone on disability and intensity of headache.",research

Abstract: Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most common type of headache worldwide. It is defined and classified according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders. TTH is treated with over-the-counter medications, mostly paracetamol or ibuprofen. The purpose was to assess the effectiveness of paracetamol versus ibuprofen in treating episodic tension-type headache (ETTH) through direct and indirect comparisons of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We included RCTs comparing paracetamol with a placebo, ibuprofen with a placebo, or paracetamol with ibuprofen for acute ETTH treatment that were published between 1988 and 2022. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Web of Science. The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias. We identified 14 studies including 6521 people with ETTH. None of the studies had a low risk of bias for all domains; this was most likely due to inadequate reporting and a small sample size. Ibuprofen (odds ratio (OR): 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17-2.56) showed better efficacy than paracetamol (OR: 1.62, 95% CI 1.24-2.13) for pain-free status at 2 h, while paracetamol (OR: 1.42, 95% CI 0.87-2.30) showed better efficacy than ibuprofen (OR: 1.20, 95% CI 0.58-2.48) for pain-free status at 1 h. Paracetamol was associated with the lowest likelihood of rescue medication use (OR: 0.49, 95% CI 0.37-0.65). Ibuprofen was associated with a lower likelihood of the occurrence of any events and gastrointestinal adverse events compared with placebo and paracetamol (OR: 0.95, 95% CI 0.64-1.41 and OR: 0.81, 95% CI 0.44-1.50, respectively).",research

Published: Jul 2024

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) plays a crucial role in metabolic disorders by enhancing insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon release, and slowing gastric emptying, thereby improving glycemic control. In recent years, GLP-1 role in neuronal pathways has expanded its therapeutic potential. We aim to comprehensively evaluate the relevance of GLP-1 in headache and pain disorders. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed and Embase (Ovid) databases using the search terms ""GLP-1"" and ""pain"". Animal and human studies published in English language were included. Abstracts, reviews, and articles on other disorders than ""pain"" were excluded. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 833 hits, of which 42 studies were included in the final review. The studies were categorized into four groups: inflammatory pain and osteoarthritis, headaches, neuropathic pain and diabetic neuropathy, and visceral pain and irritable bowel syndrome. GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, like liraglutide, have shown analgesic effects by modulating pain hypersensitivity in animal models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. GLP-1 is involved in migraine mechanisms and GLP-1R agonists are beneficial in individuals with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Additionally, GLP-1R agonists reduce visceral hypersensitivity and ameliorate symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic scope of GLP-1R agonists is expanding beyond traditional metabolic targets, highlighting its potential for headache and pain disorders. Engineering bimodal molecules that integrate GLP-1R agonism with specific pain-related mechanisms may offer innovative therapeutic options.",research

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Non-pharmacological treatment of patients with headache, such as dry needling (DN), is associated with less morbidity and mortality and lower costs than pharmacological treatment. Some of these techniques are useful in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to review the level of evidence for DN in patients with headache. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of randomised clinical trials on headache and DN on the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and PEDro databases. Methodological quality was evaluated with the Spanish version of the PEDro scale by 2 independent reviewers. RESULTS: Of a total of 136 studies, we selected 8 randomised clinical trials published between 1994 and 2019, including a total of 577 patients. Two studies evaluated patients with cervicogenic headache, 2 evaluated patients with tension-type headache, one study assessed patients with migraine, and the remaining 3 evaluated patients with mixed-type headache (tension-type headache/migraine). Quality ratings ranged from low (3/10) to high (7/10). The effectiveness of DN was similar to that of the other interventions. DN was associated with significant improvements in functional and sensory outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Dry needling should be considered for the treatment of headache, and may be applied either alone or in combination with pharmacological treatments.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Migraine and cervicogenic headache (CGH) are common headache disorders, although the large overlap of symptoms between them makes differential diagnosis challenging. To strengthen differential diagnosis, physical testing has been used to examine for the presence of musculoskeletal impairments in both conditions. This review aimed to systematically evaluate differences in physical examination findings between people with migraine, CGH and asymptomatic individuals. METHODS: The databases MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE were searched from inception until January 2020. Risk of bias was assessed with the Downs and Black Scale for non-randomized controlled trials, and with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool for diagnostic accuracy studies. When possible, meta-analyses with random effect models was performed. RESULTS: From 19,682 articles, 62 studies were included in this review and 41 were included in the meta-analyses.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of myofascial release (MFR) techniques on the intensity of headache pain and associated disability in patients with tension-type headache (TTH), cervicogenic headache (CGH), or migraine. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Eight databases were searched on September 15, 2023, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, and Wanfang Database. The risk of bias was evaluated utilizing the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool. RESULTS: Pooled results showed that MFR intervention significantly reduces pain intensity [SMD = -2.01, 95% CI (-2.98, -1.03),  CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis results indicate that MFR intervention can significantly alleviate pain and disability in TTH and CGH. For migraine, however, the results were inconsistent, and there was only moderate quality evidence of disability improvement for TTH and CGH. In contrast, the quality of other evidence was low or very low.",research

Authors: B Maranhao, M Liu, A Palanisamy et al. Published: Aug 2021

Abstract: Post-dural puncture headache is one of the most undesirable complications of spinal anaesthesia. Previous pairwise meta-analyses have either compared groups of needles or ranked individual needles based on the pooled incidence of post-dural puncture headache. These analyses have suggested both the gauge and needle tip design as risk-factors, but failed to provide an unbiased comparison of individual needles. This network meta-analysis compared the odds of post-dural puncture headache with needles of varying gauge and tip design. We searched randomised controlled trials in medical databases. The primary outcome measure of the network meta-analysis was the incidence of post-dural puncture headache. Secondary outcomes were procedural failure, backache and non-specific headache. Overall, we compared 11 different needles in 61 randomised controlled trials including a total of 14,961 participants. The probability of post-dural puncture headache and procedural failure was lowest with 26-G atraumatic needles. The 29-G cutting needle was more likely than three atraumatic needles to have the lowest odds of post-dural puncture headache, although with increased risk of procedural failure. The probability rankings were: 26 atraumatic > 27 atraumatic > 29 cutting > 24 atraumatic > 22 atraumatic > 25 atraumatic > 23 cutting > 22 cutting > 25 cutting > 27 cutting = 26 cutting for post-dural puncture headache; and 26 atraumatic > 25 cutting > 22 cutting > 24 atraumatic > 22 atraumatic > 25 atraumatic > 26 cutting > 29 cutting > 27 atraumatic = 27 cutting for procedural success. Meta-regression by type of surgical population (obstetric/non-obstetric) and participant position (sitting/lateral) did not alter these rank orders.",research

Abstract: We here present evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of migraine. These guidelines, created by the Italian Society for the Study of Headache and the International Headache Society, aim to offer clear, actionable recommendations to healthcare professionals. They incorporate evidence-based recommendations from randomized controlled trials and expert-based opinions. The guidelines follow the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach for assessing the quality of evidence. The guideline development involved a systematic review of literature across multiple databases, adherence to Cochrane review methods, and a structured framework for data extraction and interpretation. Although the guidelines provide a robust foundation for migraine treatment, they also highlight gaps in current research, such as the paucity of head-to-head drug comparisons and the need for long-term outcome studies. These guidelines serve as a resource to standardize migraine treatment and promote high-quality care across different healthcare settings.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This systematic review focuses on chronic migraine patients with medication overuse headache using, respectively, topiramate, botulinum toxin type A, and human monoclonal antibodies targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide or its receptor. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in the databases CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science until May 2022. We included randomized controlled trials reporting the outcomes of change in monthly headache/migraine days, ≥50% response rates and change in medication overuse status. Studies were excluded if response rates were not reported. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane RoB2 tool. The quality of evidence for outcomes across included studies was evaluated according to the five factors outlined in Cochrane GRADE approach. FINDINGS: The initial search resulted in 1599 records. Following screening, 10 studies met our inclusion criteria, while seven studies with sufficient data were included in the meta-analysis. Studies assessing Botulinum toxin type A included 1139 patients and showed a mean reduction in headache frequency by 1.92 days per month compared to placebo (-1.92; 95% CI -2.68 to -1.16). Studies assessing human monoclonal antibodies included 1982 patients, and showed significant positive effect compared to placebo for all measured outcomes. The overall odds ratio for the ≥50% response rate was 2.90 (95% CI, 2.23 to 3.78). No significant difference was observed in the frequency of adverse effect for both Botulinum toxin type A and low dose of human monoclonal antibodies compared to placebo.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This systematic review assesses the effectiveness of physiotherapy on headache parameters and quality of life of patients with tension-type headache using network meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in the databases Web of Science, Medline, Cochrane Library and Physiotherapy Evidence Database up to August 2021. Randomised controlled trials investigating the effect of physiotherapy on tension-type headache were included. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Risk of bias tool 2.0. Results were presented according to the Cochrane handbook and the PRISMA statement. RESULTS: Twenty reports were eligible and 15 were included in network meta-analysis for pain intensity and frequency. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation combined with physiotherapy was the most effective approach to reduce pain intensity compared to control (mean difference (MD): -4.18, moderate confidence) and usual care (MD: -3.8, moderate confidence) Manual therapy (joint mobilisation) plus exercise was the most effective intervention to reduce headache frequency compared to control (MD: -13.03, low confidence) and usual care (MD: -13.95, moderate confidence). CONCLUSION: Results suggest a combination of passive physiotherapy techniques with exercise and/or transcutaneous electrical stimulation as the most effective physiotherapy intervention to reduce pain intensity and frequency in the short term.

Published: Dec 2021

Abstract: Background: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are among the most common and feared side effects of cancer treatments. Their presence has a negative impact on the quality of life and morbidity associated with the disease. Despite increasingly effective antiemetic treatments, 40% of cancer patients experience CINV during the acute or delayed phase of their treatment. This distressing experience lived through by a large number of people makes it a priority in the improvement of cancer patients and a daily concern for nurses in cancer care units. In an attempt to alleviate this problem, the idea of using aromatherapy as supportive care has led the authors to research the knowledge available on this subject. Objective: The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the existing scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of respiratory aromatherapy on CINV in addition to standard treatment compared with their recommended management in people with cancer. Design: Systematic review. Methods: This review was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines and queried six databases (PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Database, Embase, CINAHL, and Google Scholar). An analysis of the risk of bias using the Cochrane ""Risks of Bias"" tools and a qualitative synthesis of the results of the studies were carried out. Results: Eleven studies were included, nine in adults and two in children. Seven out of nine studies showed statistically significant results in adults with either direct or dry inhalation. Four out of seven alleviated both nausea and vomiting thanks to peppermint, ginger essential oil; three decreased nausea only with chamomilla, ginger or cardamom essential oil.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pregnant women commonly experience challenging nausea and vomiting, which significantly affect their general well-being and daily life. Although medication is often used for relief, it may not alleviate symptoms completely, emphasizing the need for complementary therapies. Acupuncture is one of the complementary treatments for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP). Studying the outcomes of acupuncture for NVP can shed light on this issue and inform treatment guidelines. Therefore, we systematically evaluated the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in managing NVP, considering the traditional meridian and acupoint theories. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry were searched on May 1, 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared acupuncture for NVP with sham acupuncture, placebo, and Western medicine (WM) or acupuncture plus WM with WM alone were included. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4.1, and the quality of evidence for each outcome was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.

The PICOT-SD method was used to determine the compatibility of the pieces with the eligibility criteria. FINDINGS: Fifty-eight of 3,874 articles obtained from databases fulfilled the eligibility criteria. This study demonstrated that acupuncture, aromatherapy, the oral intake of ginger, listening to music, education, and visits to patients decreased the incidence of nausea and vomiting and increased the quality of life. Additionally, it was found that patients' quality of life tended to improve along with reductions in postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support previous findings in the literature and demonstrate that nonpharmacological nursing interventions help reduce and prevent PONV. Based on our results, we suggest that nonpharmacological nursing interventions can be employed for the management of PONV in patients undergoing surgery.",research

Abstract: Although prophylactic antiemetics are commonly used perioperatively, an estimated 30% of surgical patients still suffer from postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Very few prospective trials have studied rescue treatment of PONV after failure of prophylaxis, providing limited evidence to support clinical management. In patients who have failed PONV prophylaxis, administering a rescue antiemetic from the same drug class has been reported to be ineffective. For many antiemetics currently used in PONV rescue, significant uncertainty remains around the effective dose range, speed of onset, duration of effect, safety, and overall risk-benefit ratio. As prompt, effective PONV rescue after failure of prophylaxis is important to optimize postoperative recovery and resource utilization, we conduct this systematic review to summarize the current evidence available on the topic.",research

Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Nausea and vomiting affects approximately 85% of pregnant women. The most severe form, hyperemesis gravidarum, affects up to 3% of women and can have significant adverse physical and psychological sequelae. OBJECTIVE: To summarize current evidence on effective treatments for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Databases were searched to June 8, 2016. Relevant websites and bibliographies were also searched. Titles and abstracts were assessed independently by 2 reviewers. Results were narratively synthesized; planned meta-analysis was not possible because of heterogeneity and incomplete reporting of findings. FINDINGS: Seventy-eight studies (n  = 8930 participants) were included: 67 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and 11 nonrandomized studies. Evidence from 35 RCTs at low risk of bias indicated that ginger, vitamin B6, antihistamines, metoclopramide (for mild symptoms), pyridoxine-doxylamine, and ondansetron (for moderate symptoms) were associated with improved symptoms compared with placebo. One RCT (n = 86) reported greater improvements in moderate symptoms following psychotherapy (change in Rhodes score [range, 0 {no symptoms} to 40 {worst possible symptoms}], 18.76 [SD, 5.48] to 7.06 [SD, 5.79] for intervention vs 19.18 [SD, 5.63] to 12.81 [SD, 6.88] for comparator [P < .001]). For moderate-severe symptoms, 1 RCT (n = 60) suggested that pyridoxine-doxylamine combination taken preemptively reduced risk of recurrence of moderate-severe symptoms compared with treatment once symptoms begin (15.4% vs 39.1% [P < .04]).",research

Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), with a specific intention on exploring sources of between-study variation in treatment effects. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodicals Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared acupuncture to sham acupuncture or usual care (UC). The main outcome is complete control (no vomiting episodes and/or no more than mild nausea) of CINV. GRADE approach was used to rate the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: Thirty-eight RCTs with a total of 2503 patients were evaluated. Acupuncture in addition to UC may increase the complete control of acute vomiting (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.25; 10 studies) and delayed vomiting (RR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.00; 10 studies) when compared with UC only. No effects were found for all other review outcomes. The certainty of evidence was generally low or very low. None of the predefined moderators changed the overall findings, but in an exploratory moderator analysis we found that an adequate reporting of planned rescue antiemetics might decrease the effect size of complete control of acute vomiting (p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture in addition to usual care may increase the complete control of chemotherapy-induced acute vomiting and delayed vomiting but the certainty of evidence was very low.

This study searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) related to ginger supplement intake for CINV in three electronic databases (i.e., Medline (PubMed), Embase, and Web of Science). The search period ranged from each database's first date of service to 5 November 2021. Two investigators independently performed abstract screenings, full-text screenings, data extraction, and risk of bias analyses (ROB). The Cochrane ROB tool was used for the assessment of ROB. This study systematically reviewed 23 RCTs. The effects of ginger supplementation were compared to those of placebo or antiemetic agents. This study conducted a meta-analysis after classifying the effects of ginger supplementation on acute and delayed CINV into subgroups due to the clinical heterogeneity between these RCTs.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: and purpose: Aromatherapy offers a low-risk solution for effectively managing common nausea and vomiting in cancer patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess its impact on these symptoms to facilitate practical guidelines establishment. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Embase were searched for articles published until April 30, 2023. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effect of aromatherapy on nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer (age ≥18 years). The effect size was calculated using standardized mean differences (SMDs) with a random effects model. Subgroup analyses, meta-analysis of variance, and meta-regression were performed using the ""meta"" package in R version 4.0.2. Heterogeneity was assessed using I RESULTS: Twenty-five RCTs across 10 articles revealed that aromatherapy reduced overall nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer with significant efficacy (SMD = -0.81, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: -1.11 to -0.52). Furthermore, aromatherapy reduced nausea (SMD = -0.85, 95 % CI: -1.23 to -0.46) and combined nausea and vomiting (SMD = -1.08, 95 % CI: -1.68 to -0.47), but not vomiting alone (SMD = -0.24, 95 % CI: -1.03 to 0.55). Inhalation and massage yielded positive results, especially in chemotherapy-induced cases; peppermint oil was particularly successful. CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore aromatherapy's value in managing cancer treatment-associated nausea and vomiting. Conclusive evidence on aromatherapy-led nausea reduction is lacking due to limited RCTs; research is warranted for robust conclusions.",research

Abstract: PURPOSE: To identify effective and safe interventions to prevent acute phase chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in adult and pediatric patients. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of randomized trials evaluating interventions to prevent acute CINV. Outcomes assessed were complete chemotherapy-induced vomiting (CIV) control, complete chemotherapy-induced nausea (CIN) control, complete CINV control, and discontinuation of antiemetics due to adverse effects. RESULTS: The search identified 65,172 citations; 744 were evaluated at full-text, and 295 (25 pediatric) met eligibility criteria. In patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC), complete CIV (risk ratio (RR) 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.44) and CIN (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.10-1.62) control improved when olanzapine was added. The addition of a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist (NK1RA) to a corticosteroid plus a serotonin-3 receptor antagonist (5HT3RA) also improved complete CIV (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.08-1.14) and CIN (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.08) control. Compared to granisetron/ondansetron, palonosetron provided improved complete CIV control when the 5HT3RA was given alone or when combined with dexamethasone. In patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC), dexamethasone plus a 5HT3RA improved complete CIV control compared to a 5HT3RA alone (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.21-1.39). Only a single meta-analysis evaluating the safety outcome was possible. CONCLUSIONS: For patients receiving HEC, various antiemetic regimens improved CIV and CIN control. For patients receiving MEC, administration of a 5HT3RA plus dexamethasone improved CIV control. Analysis of antiemetic safety was constrained by lack of data.",research

Abstract: Answer questions and earn CME/CNE Patients with breast cancer commonly use complementary and integrative therapies as supportive care during cancer treatment and to manage treatment-related side effects. However, evidence supporting the use of such therapies in the oncology setting is limited. This report provides updated clinical practice guidelines from the Society for Integrative Oncology on the use of integrative therapies for specific clinical indications during and after breast cancer treatment, including anxiety/stress, depression/mood disorders, fatigue, quality of life/physical functioning, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, lymphedema, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, pain, and sleep disturbance. Clinical practice guidelines are based on a systematic literature review from 1990 through 2015. Music therapy, meditation, stress management, and yoga are recommended for anxiety/stress reduction. Meditation, relaxation, yoga, massage, and music therapy are recommended for depression/mood disorders. Meditation and yoga are recommended to improve quality of life. Acupressure and acupuncture are recommended for reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Acetyl-L-carnitine is not recommended to prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy due to a possibility of harm. No strong evidence supports the use of ingested dietary supplements to manage breast cancer treatment-related side effects. In summary, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the use of integrative therapies, especially mind-body therapies, as effective supportive care strategies during breast cancer treatment.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Managing postoperative pain in patients with obesity is challenging. Although multimodal analgesia has proved effective for pain relief, the specific impacts of different nonopioid i.v. analgesics and adjuvants on these patients are not well-defined. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, paracetamol, ketamine, α-2 adrenergic receptor agonists, lidocaine, magnesium, and oral gabapentinoids in reducing perioperative opioid consumption and, secondarily, in mitigating the occurrence of general and postoperative pulmonary complications (POPCs), nausea, vomiting, PACU length of stay (LOS), and hospital LOS among surgical patients with obesity. METHODS: A systematic review and network meta-analysis was performed. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and EMBASE were searched. Only English-language RCTs investigating the use of nonopioid analgesics and adjuvants in adult surgical patients with obesity were included. The quality of evidence and certainty were assessed using the RoB 2 tool and GRADE framework, respectively. RESULTS: In total, 37 RCTs involving 3602 patients were included in the quantitative analysis. Compared with placebo/no intervention or a comparator, dexmedetomidine, ketamine, lidocaine, magnesium, and gabapentin significantly reduced postoperative opioid consumption after surgery. Ketamine/esketamine also significantly reduced POPCs.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) are common symptoms in pregnancy. Although no definitive treatment option for NVP, pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) supplementation has been used widely. The present study aims to systematically evaluate the current evidence regarding pyridoxine for the treatment of NVP. METHODS: Data were obtained using a stepwise search process using keywords in the following online medical databases; PubMed FINDINGS: Initial database searching indicated 548 potentially eligible articles, of which 18 studies satisfying the inclusion criteria were selected. Eight studies showed beneficial effects with pyridoxine alone as the supplementation, while six others found that the supplementation of pyridoxine in combination with another active substance had favourable effects. Supplementation of pyridoxine alone as well as combined treatment of pyridoxine with an active ingredient as the intervention significantly improved the symptoms of nausea according to Rhode's score [0.78 [95% CI: 0.26, 1.31; p = 0.003; I2 = 57%, p = 0.10)] and PUQE score [0.75 (95% CI: 0.28, 1.22; p = 0.002; I2 = 0%, p = 0.51)], respectively.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Several forms of cannabinoids are currently being used to manage nausea and vomiting (N/V). Emerging cases of refractory N/V associated with chronic cannabis use among adults and older patients have been reported named cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). CHS is a condition that leads to repeated and severe N/V in long-term users of cannabinoids. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to outline current treatments for the management of CHS. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. Databases were used to search for articles on CHS published from January 2009 to June 2021, yielding 225 results of which 17 were deemed relevant and underwent review by 2 separate reviewers. RESULTS: The duration of cannabis administration ranged between 6 months to 11 years may precipitate symptoms of CHS. The Rome IV diagnostic criteria of CHS require cannabinoid use and persistence of N/V symptoms for at least the past 6 months. Cannabis cessation is noted to be the most successful management, but other treatments also demonstrated symptom relief; these include hot water hydrotherapy, topical capsaicin cream, haloperidol, droperidol, benzodiazepines, propranolol, and aprepitant administration. CONCLUSION: More research on CHS is needed to enhance knowledge translation, education, and create awareness in the medical community on the side effects of cannabinoids and to propose the best treatment options.",research

Published: Aug 2017

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Chiari malformation type 1 (CM-1) is a variation of hindbrain development that can sometimes occur in asymptomatic individuals. Conventional treatment is surgical decompression, but little is known about the natural history of patients who do not undergo surgical management. This information is critical to determine how these patients should be managed. We conducted a systematic literature review to determine the natural history of CM-1, particularly in patients who did not undergo surgery and in asymptomatic individuals, to help patients and physicians determine when surgery is likely to be beneficial. METHODS: The literature search was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines using the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were predefined. RESULTS: In symptomatic patients who did not undergo surgery, headaches and nausea often improved, whereas ataxia and sensory disturbance tended not to improve spontaneously. Of patients, 27%-47% had an improvement in symptoms after 15 months, and 37%-40% with cough headache and 89% with nausea who were managed nonoperatively improved at follow-up. Most asymptomatic individuals with CM-1 remained asymptomatic (93.3%) even in the presence of syringomyelia. CONCLUSIONS: The natural history of mild symptomatic and asymptomatic CM-1 in adults is relatively benign and nonprogressive; the decision to perform surgical decompression should be based on severity and duration of a patient's symptoms at presentation. It is reasonable to observe a patient with mild or asymptomatic symptoms even in the presence of significant tonsillar descent or syringomyelia.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting increase the healthcare burden and lead to adverse clinical outcomes in cancer patients. Although many risk prediction models for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting have been developed, their methodological quality and applicability remain uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review and evaluate existing studies on risk prediction models for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in cancer patients. METHODS: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of science, CINAHL, Scopus, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), Wanfang Database, Chinese Biomedical literature Database (CBM) were systematically searched from inception to October 1, 2024. Studies were appraised critically and data extracted by two authors independently based on the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modeling Studies (CHARMS). RESULTS: A total of 4195 articles were retrieved, ultimately including 17 studies with 62 models for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The sample size of the included studies ranged from 137 to 2215, with areas under the curve ranging from 0.602 to 0.850.

CONCLUSION: The research on prediction models for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting model is in its developing stage, with both commonalities and differences in predictors. Despite the overall acceptable performance of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting models, most studies have methodological shortcomings, and few models have been validated. Future studies should refer to the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) guideline for model design, implementation, and reporting.

Abstract: AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe the main acupuncture techniques and parameters that have been used in the most varied symptoms of different types of cancer. BACKGROUND: Clinical evidence about the potential effectiveness of acupuncture and related therapies to control signs and symptoms associated with cancer or its treatment has been in several studies. Currently, there is already evidence of the use of acupuncture for the treatment of nausea and vomiting, fatigue, dry mouth, anxiety, depression, insomnia and pain. However, many studies lack firm rights or reproducible guidelines for treatment. DESIGN: This study performs a systematic review of clinical trials related to the topic, based on the PRISMA protocol. Thus, a search was carried out in the Scopus, Pubmed and Web of Science databases, covering studies since January 2007. METHODS: Structured and organised according to PICO standards, using keywords (""cancer"" OR ""malignant tumour"" OR ""chemotherapy"" OR ""radiotherapy"") AND (""acupuncture"" OR ""electroacupuncture"") AND (""pain"" OR ""nausea"" OR ""vomit"" OR ""fatigue"" OR ""xerostomia"" OR ""insomnia"" OR ""depression"" OR ""neuropathy""). RESULTS: After the selection and evaluation phase, 23 studies were included and analysed. CONCLUSION: Based on this analysis, it is concluded that acupuncture is safe and there is evidence of the reduction of gastrointestinal symptoms, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, pain, dry mouth, fatigue, insomnia, and improvement of cognitive capacity.

If intrathecal opioid was not administered, single-injection local anaesthetic wound infiltration; continuous wound local anaesthetic infusion; and/or fascial plane blocks such as transversus abdominis plane or quadratus lumborum blocks are recommended. The postoperative regimen should include regular paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with opioids used for rescue. The surgical technique should include a Joel-Cohen incision; non-closure of the peritoneum; and abdominal binders.",research

Abstract: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery has become increasingly popular due to faster recovery times and reduced postoperative pain compared with thoracotomy. However, analgesic regimens for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery vary significantly. The goal of this systematic review was to evaluate the available literature and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. A systematic review was undertaken using procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) methodology. Randomised controlled trials published in the English language, between January 2010 and January 2021 assessing the effect of analgesic, anaesthetic or surgical interventions were identified. We retrieved 1070 studies of which 69 randomised controlled trials and two reviews met inclusion criteria. We recommend the administration of basic analgesia including paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or cyclo-oxygenase-2-specific inhibitors pre-operatively or intra-operatively and continued postoperatively. Intra-operative intravenous dexmedetomidine infusion may be used, specifically when basic analgesia and regional analgesic techniques could not be given. In addition, a paravertebral block or erector spinae plane block is recommended as a first-choice option. A serratus anterior plane block could also be administered as a second-choice option. Opioids should be reserved as rescue analgesics in the postoperative period.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Complex spinal procedures are associated with intense pain in the postoperative period. Adequate peri-operative pain management has been shown to correlate with improved outcomes including early ambulation and early discharge. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the available literature and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after complex spine surgery. DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES: A systematic review using the PROcedure SPECific postoperative pain managemenT methodology was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews published in the English language from January 2008 to April 2020 assessing postoperative pain after complex spine surgery using analgesic, anaesthetic or surgical interventions were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Databases. RESULTS: Out of 111 eligible studies identified, 31 randomised controlled trials and four systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Pre-operative and intra-operative interventions that improved postoperative pain were paracetamol, cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 specific-inhibitors or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intravenous ketamine infusion and regional analgesia techniques including epidural analgesia using local anaesthetics with or without opioids. Limited evidence was found for local wound infiltration, intrathecal and epidural opioids, erector spinae plane block, thoracolumbar interfascial plane block, intravenous lidocaine, dexmedetomidine and gabapentin. CONCLUSIONS: The analgesic regimen for complex spine surgery should include pre-operative or intra-operative paracetamol and COX-2 specific inhibitors or NSAIDs, continued postoperatively with opioids used as rescue analgesics.",research

Further qualitative randomised controlled trials are required to confirm the efficacy and safety of these recommended analgesics on postoperative pain relief.",research

Abstract: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be associated with significant postoperative pain that is difficult to treat. We aimed to evaluate the available literature and develop updated recommendations for optimal pain management after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A systematic review was performed using the procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) methodology. Randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews published in the English language from August 2017 to December 2022 assessing postoperative pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy using analgesic, anaesthetic or surgical interventions were identified from MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Databases. From 589 full text articles, 157 randomised controlled trials and 31 systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Paracetamol combined with NSAIDs or cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors should be given either pre-operatively or intra-operatively, unless contraindicated. In addition, intra-operative intravenous (i.v.) dexamethasone, port-site wound infiltration or intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation are recommended, with opioids used for rescue analgesia. As a second-line regional technique, the erector spinae plane block or transversus abdominis plane block may be reserved for patients with a heightened risk of postoperative pain. Three-port laparoscopy, a low-pressure pneumoperitoneum, umbilical port extraction, active aspiration of the pneumoperitoneum and saline irrigation are recommended technical aspects of the operative procedure.",research

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) in managing different types of pain in different age groups and to provide evidence for the clinical application of new alternative strategy for pain management. METHODS: Electronic databases, including the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Web of Science, were searched for studies published up to October 2020. Randomized controlled trials that reported on VR for pain management were included. RESULTS: A total of 31 randomized controlled trials were included. As for the pain intensity, the increase of visual analog scale score in the VR group was 1.62 scores less than that in the control group. In juvenile patients, the VR group had 1.79 scores lower than that in control group. For adult patients, the VR group had 1.34 scores lower than that in control group. As for other pain-related indicators, the VR group had lower levels of anxiety, lower pain unpleasantness, lower pulse rate, and shorter duration of dressing change and spent less time thinking about pain. Nevertheless, there was no statistical difference in pain tolerance. VR can effectively alleviate acute pain. In terms of chronic low back pain and cancer-related pain, there was no statistical difference between VR therapy and standard therapy. CONCLUSIONS: VR is a feasible alternative therapy for both juveniles and adults in pain management, and it has a greater potential for juveniles. VR can effectively alleviate acute pain. Nevertheless, VR showed little effectiveness in increasing pain tolerance, which may explain in part the ineffectiveness of VR therapy in pain management for chronic pain.",research

Abstract: Tonsillectomy is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures; however, pain management remains challenging. Procedure-specific efficacy as well as specific risks of treatment options should guide selection of pain management protocols based on evidence and should optimise analgesia without harm. The aims of this systematic review were to evaluate the available literature and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after tonsillectomy. A systematic review utilising preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines with procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) methodology was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials published in the English language up to November 2019 assessing postoperative pain using analgesic, anaesthetic or surgical interventions were identified. Out of the 719 potentially eligible studies identified, 226 randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, excluding the studies examining surgical techniques. Pre-operative and intra-operative interventions that improved postoperative pain were paracetamol; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; intravenous dexamethasone; ketamine (only assessed in children); gabapentinoids; dexmedetomidine; honey; and acupuncture. Inconsistent evidence was found for local anaesthetic infiltration; antibiotics; and magnesium sulphate. Limited evidence was found for clonidine. The analgesic regimen for tonsillectomy should include paracetamol; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; and intravenous dexamethasone, with opioids as rescue analgesics. Analgesic adjuncts such as intra-operative and postoperative acupuncture as well as postoperative honey are also recommended.",research

Abstract: Background: Pain management is an important priority in the treatment of acute pancreatitis (AP). Current evidence and guideline recommendations are inconsistent on the most effective analgesic protocol. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of analgesics for pain relief in AP. Methods: A literature search was performed to identify all RCTs assessing analgesics in patients with AP. The primary outcome was the number of participants who needed rescue analgesia. Study quality was assessed using Jadad score. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) or weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were analysed using a random-effects model. Results: Twelve studies comprising 699 patients with AP (83% mild AP) were analysed. The tested analgesics significantly decreased the need for rescue analgesia (3 studies, OR.36, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.60) vs. placebo or conventional treatment. The analgesics also improved the pain score [Visual Analogue Scale (Δ-VAS)] at 24 h (WMD 18.46, 0.84 to 36.07) and by the 3rd to 7th days (WMD 11.57, 0.87 to 22.28). Opioids vs. non-opioids were associated with a decrease in the need for rescue analgesia (6 studies, OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.86, p = 0.03) but without significance in pain score. In subgroup analyses, opioids were similar to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) regarding the primary outcome (4 studies, OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.32, p = 0.18). There were no significant differences in other clinical outcomes and rate of adverse events. Other studies, comparing epidural anaesthesia vs. patient-controlled analgesia and opioid (buprenorphine) vs. opioid (pethidine) did not show significant difference in primary outcome.",research

Abstract: Background: Primary dysmenorrhea is a common gynecological disorder that affects many women of reproductive age. Ginger, a widely used spice with anti-inflammatory properties, has been suggested as a potential treatment for the painful cramps associated with this condition. Objective: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of ginger for pain management in primary dysmenorrhea. Methods: Our systematic review was registered in Prospero (CRD42023418001). Six English (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL complete, and Cochrane) and one Persian electric database (SID) was searched up to May 2023 for English or Persian studies that measure the effect of ginger on pain in dysmenorrhea. The Cochrane tool was used to assess the risk of bias of the included studies. Random effects meta-analyses were performed to obtain standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Out of the 804 articles initially identified from the search, 24 were included for qualitative analysis and 12 for quantitative analysis after a full-text evaluation. The combined results of the studies indicate that ginger is notably more effective than placebo in reducing both the intensity (SMD = -1.13; 95% CI = -1.59 to -0.68, I2 = 81.05%) and duration of pain (SMD = -0.29; 95% CI = -0.46 to -0.12). There were no differences between ginger and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (SMD = 0.01; 95% CI = -0.24 to 0.25), or exercise (SMD = 0.06; 95% CI = -0.66 to 0.78) for pain intensity.

Abstract: Analgesic protocols used to treat pain after breast surgery vary significantly. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available literature on this topic and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after oncological breast surgery. A systematic review using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidance with procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) methodology was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials assessing postoperative pain using analgesic, anaesthetic or surgical interventions were identified. Seven hundred and forty-nine studies were found, of which 53 randomised controlled trials and nine meta-analyses met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Quantitative analysis suggests that dexamethasone and gabapentin reduced postoperative pain. The use of paravertebral blocks also reduced postoperative pain scores, analgesia consumption and the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Intra-operative opioid requirements were documented to be lower when a pectoral nerves block was performed, which also reduced postoperative pain scores and opioid consumption. We recommend basic analgesics (i.e. paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) administered pre-operatively or intra-operatively and continued postoperatively. In addition, pre-operative gabapentin and dexamethasone are also recommended. In major breast surgery, a regional anaesthetic technique such as paravertebral block or pectoral nerves block and/or local anaesthetic wound infiltration may be considered for additional pain relief.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Gate control theory and fear-avoidance model of chronic pain posit that biopsychosocial factors can modulate pain. Nonpharmacological interventions are recommended in managing chronic pain, but little information is available regarding their efficacy in older adults. We examined and compared the efficacy of different nonpharmacological intervention approaches for chronic pain management among older adults via meta-analysis and subgroup analysis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (PROSPERO number CRD42020222767), a systematic search was undertaken using MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO up to March 21, 2022. Randomized controlled trials were included, and data were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis model. Risk of bias was assessed using a quality rating scale for psychological interventions. RESULTS: Twenty-five trials (N = 2,394 participants) were identified. Six types of nonpharmacological interventions were compared with control conditions (sham/attention control and treatment as usual). Nonpharmacological interventions were associated with significant reductions in pain intensity, pain interference, depressive symptoms, catastrophizing beliefs, and improvement in physical performance (standardized mean differences -0.34 to 0.54). Subgroup analyses based on different nonpharmacological approaches revealed the benefits of psychological approaches combined with physical activity.

Authors: Lauren A Spreen, Emma N Dittmar, Kyle C Quirk et al. Published: May 2022

Abstract: Buprenorphine possesses many unique attributes that make it a practical agent for adults and adolescents with opioid use disorder (OUD) and/or acute or chronic pain. Sublingual buprenorphine has been the standard of care for treating OUD, but its use in pain management is not as clearly defined. Current practice guidelines recommend a period of mild-to-moderate withdrawal from opioids before transitioning to buprenorphine due to its ability to displace full agonists from the μ-opioid receptor. However, this strategy can lead to negative physical and psychological outcomes for patients. Novel initiation strategies suggest that concomitant administration of small doses of buprenorphine with opioids can avoid the unwanted withdrawal associated with buprenorphine initiation. We aim to systematically review the buprenorphine initiation strategies that have emerged in the last decade. Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Databases were searched for relevant literature. Studies were included if they were published in the English language and described the transition to buprenorphine from opioids. Data were collected from each study and synthesized using descriptive statistics. This review included 7 observational studies, 1 feasibility study, and 39 case reports/series which included 924 patients. The strategies utilized between the literature included traditional initiation (47.9%), microdosing with various buprenorphine formulations (16%), and miscellaneous methods (36.1%). Traditional initiation and microdosing initiation were compared in the data synthesis and analysis; miscellaneous methods were omitted given the high variability between methods.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pain is one of the most common and problematic symptoms encountered by patients with cancer. Due to the multifactorial aetiology, pain management of these patients frequently requires multidisciplinary interventions including conventional support and specialty palliative care. Acupuncture has been identified as a possible adjunctive therapy for symptom management in cancer pain, and there is currently no systematic review focused solely on the evidence of acupuncture on cancer pain in palliative care. OBJECTIVE: To critically analyse currently available publications regarding the use of acupuncture for pain management among patients with cancer in palliative care settings. METHODS: Multiple academic databases were searched from inception to 29 October 2020. Randomised controlled trials involving acupuncture in palliative care for treatment of cancer-related pain were synthesised. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers, and methodological quality of each included study was assessed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) 2011 Levels of Evidence. RESULTS: Five studies (n=189) were included in this systematic review. Results indicated a favourable effect of acupuncture on pain relief in palliative care for patients with cancer. According to OCEBM 2011 Levels of Evidence, they were level 2 in one case (20%), level 3 in two cases (40%) and level 4 in the remaining (40%). Low-level evidence adversely affects the reliability of findings. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture may be an effective and safe treatment associated with pain reduction in the palliative care of patients with cancer. Further high-quality, adequately powered studies are needed in the future.",research

Authors: Thomas R Hickey, Gabriel P A Costa, Debora Oliveira et al. Published: Jan 2026

Abstract: BACKGROUND/IMPORTANCE: Opioids continue to play a key role in managing acute postoperative pain, but their use contributes to adverse outcomes. Buprenorphine may offer effective analgesia with a superior safety profile. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of buprenorphine with other opioids for acute postoperative pain management in adults. EVIDENCE REVIEW: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science were searched from inception to February 2024. Randomized controlled trials comparing buprenorphine with other opioids for acute postoperative pain management in adults were included. Of 2421 records identified, 58 studies met inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed using Stata/BE V.18. The primary outcome was pain intensity. Secondary outcomes included rescue analgesia use, duration of analgesia, and adverse effects. FINDINGS: Analysis of 41 comparisons (2587 participants) showed buprenorphine significantly reduced pain intensity compared with all other opioids (Hedges's g=-0.36, 95% CI=-0.59 to -0.14, p<0.001, 95% prediction interval (PI)=-1.70 to 0.97). This effect persisted when compared with full agonist opioid (FAO) alone (standardized mean difference -0.34, 95% CI=-0.59 to -0.10, p<0.001, 95% PI=-1.76 to 1.07).

Abstract: AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To compare and rank the efficacy and safety of non-pharmacological interventions in the management of labour pain. BACKGROUND: Recently, various non-pharmacological interventions have been applied to manage labour pain and have shown positive effects. However, evidence identifying which type of non-pharmacological intervention is more efficient and safer is limited. DESIGN: Systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis based on PRISMA-NMA. METHODS: Seven databases were searched from database inception-March 2020. Two reviewers independently performed study selection, quality appraisal and data extraction. Conventional meta-analysis was conducted using either fixed-effects model or random-effects model according to statistical heterogeneity. The Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted using the consistency model. RESULTS: 43 studies involving nine non-pharmacological interventions were included. The Bayesian network meta-analysis showed that acupressure (SMD = -2.00, 95% CrI -3.09 to -0.94), aromatherapy (SMD = -2.01, 95% CrI -3.70 to -0.35) and massage therapy (SMD = -1.26, 95% CrI -2.26 to -0.30) had significant positive effects on alleviating labour pain, with aromatherapy being the most effective. The results also revealed that yoga (SMD = -130.85, 95% CrI -212.01 to -59.32) and acupressure (SMD = -10.14, 95% CrI -20.24 to -0.41) were the most effective interventions for shortening the first stage and the second stage of labour, respectively.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Unmanaged pain significantly affects cancer survivors' quality of life. Nurses should play a significant role in pain management through non-pharmacological interventions. This review aims to explore the efficacy and safety of breathing exercises for pain management in all cancer survivors. DESIGN: A systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Thirteen databases, including PubMed, EMBase, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, JBI, Science Direct, Scopus, SocINDEX, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CNKI, and Wan Fang, were searched from inception to May, 2021. REVIEW/ANALYSIS METHODS: Studies that focused on the efficacy of breathing exercises for pain management, regardless of the age of the cancer survivors, were included. Cochrane tools were used for the quality appraisal of the included studies. Because of the limited number of studies, descriptive data analysis was used to summarize the results. RESULTS: Ten studies were included. Slow pursed lip breathing showed benefits for post-surgical pain. Contradictory findings were identified in the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery for post-surgical pain. Slow deep breathing and Hey-Hu regular breathing techniques were effective for pain management in pediatric cancer patients. The Active Cycle of Breathing Technique and five-minute mindful breathing did not have any statistically significant effects on pain relief. Quality of life was measured in three studies, with some improvement. Only one study addressed adverse events and reported that no adverse events occurred.

Published: Dec 2022

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Symptomatic cholelithiasis is a common surgical disease and accounts for half of the over one million cholecystectomies performed in the USA annually. Despite its prevalence, only one prior systematic review has examined the evidence around treatment strategies and it contained a narrow scope. The goal of this systematic review was to analyze the clinical effectiveness of treatment options for symptomatic cholelithiasis, including surgery, non-surgical therapies, and ED pain management strategies. METHODS: Literature search was performed from January 2000 through June 2020, and a narrative analysis was performed as studies were heterogeneous. RESULTS: We identified 12 publications reporting on 10 trials (9 randomized controlled trials and 1 observational study) comparing treatment methods. The studies assessed surgery, observation, lithotripsy, ursodeoxycholic acid, electro-acupuncture, and pain-management strategies in the emergency department. Only one compared surgery to observation. CONCLUSION: This work presents the existing data and underscores the current gap in knowledge regarding treatment for patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis. We use these results to suggest how future trials may guide comparisons between the timing of surgery and watchful waiting to create a set of standardized guidelines. Providing appropriate and timely treatment for symptomatic cholelithiasis is important to streamline care for a costly and prevalent disease.

Authors: Lori Kennedy Madden, Michelle Hill, Teresa L May et al. Published: Dec 2017

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Targeted temperature management (TTM) is often used in neurocritical care to minimize secondary neurologic injury and improve outcomes. TTM encompasses therapeutic hypothermia, controlled normothermia, and treatment of fever. TTM is best supported by evidence from neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, although it has also been explored in ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, and intracranial hemorrhage patients. Critical care clinicians using TTM must select appropriate cooling techniques, provide a reasonable rate of cooling, manage shivering, and ensure adequate patient monitoring among other challenges. METHODS: The Neurocritical Care Society recruited experts in neurocritical care, nursing, and pharmacotherapy to form a writing Committee in 2015. The group generated a set of 16 clinical questions relevant to TTM using the PICO format. With the assistance of a research librarian, the Committee undertook a comprehensive literature search with no back date through November 2016 with additional references up to March 2017. RESULTS: The Committee utilized GRADE methodology to adjudicate the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low based on their confidence that the estimate of effect approximated the true effect. They generated recommendations regarding the implementation of TTM based on this systematic review only after considering the quality of evidence, relative risks and benefits, patient values and preferences, and resource allocation. CONCLUSION: This guideline is intended for neurocritical care clinicians who have chosen to use TTM in patient care; it is not meant to provide guidance regarding the clinical indications for TTM itself.",research

Authors: Ebrahim Abbasi
Published: Jan 2025

Abstract: Dengue fever, caused by the dengue virus (DENV) and transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitos, remains a global health concern with no definitive treatment. Given the challenges in vaccine development and disease management, micronutrients such as vitamin D have emerged as potential adjunctive therapies because of their immunomodulatory properties. The effectiveness of vitamin D in the prevention and control of dengue fever was assessed in this systematic review by evaluating vitamin D's impact on immune responses, viral replication, and clinical outcomes. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, relevant studies were retrieved from the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies examining the association between vitamin D and DENV infection, disease severity, and immune modulation. Six studies met the inclusion criteria. Findings indicated that vitamin D supplementation reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, enhanced macrophage responses, and modulated toll-like receptor activity. Higher vitamin D levels were associated with lower viral replication and milder clinical manifestations of dengue fever. Vitamin D demonstrates potential as an adjunctive therapy for dengue fever by modulating immune responses and reducing disease severity. More clinical trials are required to validate its therapeutic efficacy and determine optimal supplementation strategies.

Abstract: Migraine and sleep disorders are common and often burdensome chronic conditions with a high prevalence in the general population, and with considerable socio-economic impact and costs.The existence of a relationship between migraine and sleep disorders has been recognized from centuries by clinicians and epidemiological studies. Nevertheless, the exact nature of this association, the underlying mechanisms and interactions are complex and not completely understood. Recent biochemical and functional imaging studies identified central nervous system structures and neurotransmitters involved in the pathophysiology of migraine and also important for the regulation of normal sleep architecture, suggesting a possible causative role, in the pathogenesis of both disorders, of a dysregulation in these common nervous system pathways.This systematic review summarizes the existing data on migraine and sleep disorders with the aim to evaluate the existence of a causal relationship and to assess the presence of influencing factors. The identification of specific sleep disorders associated with migraine should induce clinicians to systematically assess their presence in migraine patients and to adopt combined treatment strategies.",research

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: While there are several trials that support the efficacy of various drugs for migraine prophylaxis against placebo, there is limited evidence addressing the comparative safety and efficacy of these drugs. We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to facilitate comparison between drugs for migraine prophylaxis. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and clinicaltrials.gov from inception to August 13, 2022, for randomized trials of pharmacological treatments for migraine prophylaxis in adults. Reviewers worked independently and in duplicate to screen references, extract data, and assess risk of bias. We performed a frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis and rated the certainty (quality) of evidence as either high, moderate, low, or very low using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: We identified 74 eligible trials, reporting on 32,990 patients. We found high certainty evidence that monoclonal antibodies acting on the calcitonin gene related peptide or its receptor (CGRP(r)mAbs), gepants, and topiramate increase the proportion of patients who experience a 50% or more reduction in monthly migraine days, compared to placebo. We found moderate certainty evidence that beta-blockers, valproate, and amitriptyline increase the proportion of patients who experience a 50% or more reduction in monthly migraine days, and low certainty evidence that gabapentin may not be different from placebo.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study reviewed migraine prevalence and disability gathered through epidemiologic survey studies in the United States conducted over the past three decades. We summarized these studies and evaluated changing patterns of disease prevalence and disability. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of US studies addressing the prevalence, disability, and/or burden of migraine, including both episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM). A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol was used in conjunction with the PubMed search engine. Eligible studies were published before February 2022, were conducted in the United States, included representative samples, and used a case definition of migraine based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD). The primary measure of disease burden was the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS). The MIDAS measures days lost due to migraine over 3 months in three domains and defines groups with moderate (Grade III) or severe disability (Grade IV) using cut-scores. RESULTS: Of the 1609 identified records, 26 publications from 11 US population-based studies met eligibility criteria. The prevalence of migraine in the population has remained relatively consistent for the past 30 years: ranging from 11.7% to 14.7% overall, 17.1% to 19.2% in women, and 5.6% to 7.2% in men in the studies reviewed. CM prevalence is 0.91% (1.3% among women and 0.5% of men) in adults and 0.8% in adolescents. The proportion of people with migraine and moderate-to-severe MIDAS disability (Grades III-IV), has trended upward across studies from 22.0% in 2005 to 39.0% in 2012, to 43.2% in 2016, and 42.4% in 2018.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Migraine is a disabling primary headache disorder often associated with triggers. Diet-related triggers are a common cause of migraine and certain diets have been reported to decrease the frequency of migraine attacks if dietary triggers or patterns are adjusted. OBJECTIVE: The systematic literature review was conducted to qualitatively summarize evidence from the published literature regarding the role of diet patterns, diet-related triggers, and diet interventions in people with migraine. METHODS: A literature search was carried out on diet patterns, diet-related triggers, and diet interventions used to treat and/or prevent migraine attacks, using an a priori protocol. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched to identify studies assessing the effect of diet, food, and nutrition in people with migraine aged ≥18 years. Only primary literature sources (randomized controlled trials or observational studies) were included and searches were conducted from January 2000 to March 2019. The NICE checklist was used to assess the quality of the included studies of randomized controlled trials and the Downs and Black checklist was used for the assessment of observational studies. RESULTS: A total of 43 studies were included in this review, of which 11 assessed diet patterns, 12 assessed diet interventions, and 20 assessed diet-related triggers.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although triptans are widely used in the acute management of migraine, there is uncertainty around the comparative efficacy of triptans among each other and vs non-triptan migraine treatments. We conducted systematic reviews and network meta-analyses to compare the relative efficacy of triptans (alone or in combination with other drugs) for acute treatment of migraines compared with other triptan agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), acetaminophen, ergots, opioids, or anti-emetics. METHODS: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched for randomized controlled trials that compared triptans (alone or in combination with other drugs) with placebo-controlled or active migraine treatments. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were completed independently by multiple reviewers. Outcome data were combined and analyzed using a Bayesian network meta-analysis. For each outcome, odds ratios, relative risks, and absolute probability of response were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 133 randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Standard dose triptans relieved headaches within 2 hours in 42 to 76% of patients, and 2-hour sustained freedom from pain was achieved for 18 to 50% of patients. Standard dose triptans provided sustained headache relief at 24 hours in 29 to 50% of patients, and sustained freedom from pain in 18 to 33% of patients. Use of rescue medications ranged from 20 to 34%. For 2-hour headache relief, standard dose triptan achieved better outcomes (42 to 76% response) than ergots (38%); equal or better outcomes than NSAIDs, ASA, and acetaminophen (46 to 52%); and equal or slightly worse outcomes than combination therapy (62 to 80%).",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Several novel treatments targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide pathway have been developed for migraine. We evaluated the efficacy of these medications, including atogepant, rimegepant, erenumab, eptinezumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab, for the prevention of migraine via network meta-analysis. METHODS: Databases, including MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane central, were systematically reviewed, and all eligible phase 3 randomised controlled trials were included. RESULTS: Nineteen studies (n = 14,584 participants) were included. Studies included episodic (n = 11) and chronic (n = 4) migraine or both (n = 4). All interventions, except for eptinzumab 30 CONCLUSION: The results show that medications targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide were effective in preventing migraine compared to placebo. Considering limitations of single studies, different populations such as episodic and chronic migraine, and the absence of head-to-head trials, all novel treatments decreased mean monthly migraine and headache days, and showed higher 50%, 75% and 100% responder rates than placebo.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Migraine is one of the most common types of headache, and it is the second most common cause of neurological disorders, with an annual prevalence of about 15% of the population. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of BoNT-A on the duration and intensity of migraine attacks. In addition, we investigated the effective injection sites. METHODS: According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched online databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, ProQuest, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar from 2011 to 2021. RESULTS: A total of 24 articles were included in the study. The use of BoNT-A in individuals suffering from chronic migraine (CM) decreases the frequency of migraine attacks per month, pain intensity, medication use, emergency visits, and migraine-related disabilities. The BoNT-A was well tolerated and leads to improved performance and better quality of life (QoL). Overall, treatment with BoNT-A in adults with CM is beneficial. In addition, the use of BoNT-A in individuals with vestibular migraine (VM) reduces the frequency of migraines and brings about the improvement of disability status caused by migraine headaches. Meanwhile, the use of BoNT-A reduces the frequency of migraine attacks per month among individuals with chronic refractory migraine (CRM). CONCLUSIONS: The use of BoNT-A is a low-cost option for the treatment of various kinds of migraines, including chronic, episodic, unilateral, and vestibular types. BoNT-A can reduce the frequency of migraine attacks per month and diminish the severity of pain.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Several small studies have suggested that spinal manipulation may be an effective treatment for reducing migraine pain and disability. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to evaluate the evidence regarding spinal manipulation as an alternative or integrative therapy in reducing migraine pain and disability. METHODS: PubMed and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for clinical trials that evaluated spinal manipulation and migraine-related outcomes through April 2017. Search terms included: migraine, spinal manipulation, manual therapy, chiropractic, and osteopathic. Meta-analytic methods were employed to estimate the effect sizes (Hedges' g) and heterogeneity (I RESULTS: Our search identified 6 RCTs (pooled n = 677; range of n = 42-218) eligible for meta-analysis. Intervention duration ranged from 2 to 6 months; outcomes included measures of migraine days (primary outcome), migraine pain/intensity, and migraine disability. Methodological quality varied across the studies. For example, some studies received high or unclear bias scores for methodological features such as compliance, blinding, and completeness of outcome data. Due to high levels of heterogeneity when all 6 studies were included in the meta-analysis, the 1 RCT performed only among chronic migraineurs was excluded. Heterogeneity across the remaining studies was low. We observed that spinal manipulation reduced migraine days with an overall small effect size (Hedges' g = -0.35, 95% CI: -0.53, -0.16, P < .001) as well as migraine pain/intensity.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To compare various exercise modalities' efficacy on migraine frequency, intensity, duration, and disability. BACKGROUND: Exercise has been shown to be an effective intervention to reduce migraine symptoms and disability; however, no clear evidence exists regarding the most effective exercise modalities for migraine treatment. METHODS: A systematic review was performed in PubMed, PEDro, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Clinical trials that analyzed the efficacy of various exercise modalities in addressing the frequency, intensity, duration, and disability of patients with migraine were included. Eight network meta-analyses based on frequentist (F) and Bayesian (B) models were developed to estimate the direct and indirect evidence of various exercise modalities. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence (CI) and credible intervals (CrI) were calculated for each treatment effect based on Hedge's g and p scores to rank the modalities. RESULTS: We included 28 studies with 1501 migraine participants. Yoga (F: SMD -1.30; 95% CI -2.09, -0.51; B: SMD -1.33; 95% CrI -2.21, -0.45), high-intensity aerobic exercise (F: SMD -1.30; 95% CI -2.21, -0.39; B: SMD -1.17; 95% CrI -2.20, -0.20) and moderate-intensity continuous aerobic exercise (F: SMD -1.01; 95% CI -1.63, -0.39; B: SMD -1.06; 95% CrI -1.74, -0.38) were significantly superior to pharmacological treatment alone for decreasing migraine frequency based on both models.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES/BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to synthesize evidence on the benefits and harms of behavioral interventions for migraine prevention in children and adults. The efficacy and safety of behavioral interventions for migraine prevention have not been tested in recent systematic reviews. METHODS: An expert panel including clinical psychologists, neurologists, primary care physicians, researchers, funders, individuals with migraine, and their caregivers informed the scope and methods. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, clinicaltrials.gov, and gray literature for English-language randomized trials (January 1, 1975 to August 24, 2023) of behavioral interventions for preventing migraine attacks. Primary outcomes were migraine/headache frequency, migraine disability, and migraine-related quality of life. One reviewer extracted data and rated the risk of bias, and a second verified data for completeness and accuracy. Data were synthesized with meta-analysis when deemed appropriate, and we rated the strength of evidence (SOE) using established methods. RESULTS: For adults, we included 50 trials (77 publications, N = 6024 adults). Most interventions were multicomponent (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT], biofeedback, relaxation training, mindfulness-based therapies, and/or education). Most trials were at high risk of bias, primarily due to possible measurement bias and incomplete data. For adults, we found that any of three components (CBT, relaxation training, mindfulness-based therapies) may reduce migraine/headache attack frequency (SOE: low). Education alone that targets behavior may improve migraine-related disability (SOE: low).",research

We also found that mindfulness-based therapies may reduce migraine disability more than education, and relaxation + education may improve migraine-related quality of life more than propranolol (SOE: low). For children/adolescents, we included 13 trials (16 publications, N = 1444 children), but the evidence was only sufficient to conclude that CBT + biofeedback + relaxation training may reduce migraine attack frequency and disability more than education alone (SOE: low). CONCLUSION: Results suggest that for adults, CBT, relaxation training, and mindfulness-based therapies may each reduce the frequency of migraine/headache attacks, and education alone may reduce disability. For children/adolescents, CBT + biofeedback + relaxation training may reduce migraine attack frequency and disability more than education alone. Evidence consisted primarily of underpowered trials of multicomponent interventions compared with various types of control groups. Limitations include semantic inconsistencies in the literature since 1975, differential usage of treatment components, expectation effects for subjectively reported outcomes, incomplete data, and unclear dosing effects. Future research should enroll children and adolescents, standardize intervention components when possible to improve reproducibility, consider smart study designs and personalized therapies based on individual characteristics, use comparison groups that control for expectation, which is a known challenge in behavioral trials, enroll and retain larger samples, study emerging digital and telehealth modes of care delivery, improve the completeness of data collection, and establish or update clinical trial conduct and reporting guidelines that are appropriate for the conduct of studies of behavioral therapies.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Chronic migraine can be a profoundly disabling disorder that may be treated with preventive medications. However, uncertainty remains as to which preventive medication is the most effective. We present a network meta-analysis to determine the effectiveness and rank of preventive drugs for chronic migraine in adults. METHODS: We identified, reviewed, and extracted data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of preventive drugs for chronic migraine with at least 200 participants. Data were analysed using network meta-analysis. FINDINGS: We included 12 RCTs of six medications (Eptinezumab, Erenumab, Fremanezumab, Galcanezumab, Onabotulinumtoxin A, and Topiramate) compared to placebo or each other. All drugs effectively reduced monthly headache and migraine days compared with placebo. The most effective drug for monthly headache days was Eptinezumab 300mg, with a mean difference of -2.46 days, 95% Credible Interval (CrI): -3.23 to -1.69. On the Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Area (SUCRA) analysis, the probability that Eptinezumab 300mg was ranked highest was 0.82. For monthly migraine days, the most effective medication was Fremanezumab-monthly, with a mean difference: -2.77 days, 95% CrI: -3.36 to -2.17, and 0.98 probability of being ranked the highest. All included drugs, except Topiramate, improved headache-related quality of life. No eligible studies were identified for the other common preventive oral medications such as Amitriptyline, Candesartan, and Propranolol. The main reasons were that the studies did not define chronic migraine, were undertaken before the definition of chronic migraine, or were too small.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Multiple clinical trials with different exercise protocols have demonstrated efficacy in the management of migraine. However, there is no head-to-head comparison of efficacy between the different exercise interventions. METHODS: A systematic review and network meta-analysis was performed involving all clinical trials which determined the efficacy of exercise interventions in reducing the frequency of monthly migraine. Medical journal search engines included Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus spanning all previous years up to July 30, 2022. Both aerobic and strength/resistance training protocols were included. The mean difference (MD, 95% confidence interval) in monthly migraine frequency from baseline to end-of-intervention between the active and control arms was used as an outcome measure. Efficacy evidence from direct and indirect comparisons was combined by conducting a random effects model network meta-analysis. The efficacy of the three exercise protocols was compared, i.e., moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, high-intensity aerobic exercise, and strength/resistance training. Studies that compared the efficacy of migraine medications (topiramate, amitriptyline) to exercise were included. Additionally, the risk of bias in all included studies was assessed by using the Cochrane Risk of Bias version 2 (RoB2). RESULTS: There were 21 published clinical trials that involved a total of 1195 migraine patients with a mean age of 35 years and a female-to-male ratio of 6.7.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) are one of the most common complains of the early pregnancy period and are bothersome for pregnant women. Some prefer to use herbal medicine instead of chemical agents. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of ginger, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), and placebo for the treatment of NVP. METHOD: The study was performed as a triple blind clinical trial on pregnant women suffering mild to moderate NVP between 6 and 16 weeks of pregnancy. In these women ginger, 500 mg twice daily, vitamin B6 40 mg twice daily and placebo twice daily were administered for 4 d. Rhodes questionnaire was used for evaluation of the severity of symptoms. The severity of NVP was evaluated 24 h before entering the study and up to 4 d after using medications and results were compared among the three groups. RESULTS: Seventy-seven women finished the study (28 in the Ginger group, 26 in the B6 group, and 23 in the placebo group). The women of the three groups did not have significant differences according to age, gestational age, parity, and severity of each symptom before treatment and educational status. Total score of Rhodes questionnaire for nausea was decreased significantly in three groups after treatment. (p < .001, p = .012, and p = .03 for ginger, vitamin B6, and placebo, respectively.)

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a non-infectious immune disease and incidents of the disease has continuously increased in Thailand. Ginger, a Thai herb, is used in food and Thai traditional medicine. This study was designed to assess efficacy and safety of ginger extract in comparison with loratadine for AR treatment. METHODS: AR patients were treated with ginger extract 500 mg (n = 40) against those treated with loratadine 10 mg (n = 40) in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial for 3 and 6 weeks. The efficacy was evaluated from clinical examinations i.e. total nasal symptom scores (TNSS), cross-sectional area of the nasal cavity with acoustic rhinometry (ARM) and rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (RQLQ). The safety of treatment was measured by blood pressure, blood analysis and history-taking for side effects. RESULTS: The results showed both ginger extract and loratadine treated groups significantly decreased TNSS scores but there was no significant difference between the two groups. In acoustic rhinometry measurement, the ginger treated group significantly gradually increased the estimated volume of the nasal cavity and decreased distances from the nostril, but the loratadine treated group did not cause a change. Both groups gave significantly improvement in every aspect of the RQLQ at third weeks. The treatment with ginger extract was as safe as loratadine as shown by renal and liver function results obtained from blood analysis. Both treatments had no effect on blood pressure of the patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is substantial interest in the role of ginger as an adjuvant therapy for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). However, available evidence lacks robust methodology. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of adjuvant ginger compared with placebo on chemotherapy-induced nausea-related quality of life (QoL) and CINV-related outcomes. DESIGN: A parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial with 1:1 allocation was conducted. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: One hundred three chemotherapy-naïve adults scheduled to receive moderately to highly emetogenic chemotherapy at two hospitals in Australia were enrolled and analyzed. INTERVENTION: Four standardized ginger capsules (totaling 84 mg/day active gingerols/shogaols), or placebo, were administered commencing the day of chemotherapy and continuing for 5 days for chemotherapy cycles 1 through 3. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was chemotherapy-induced nausea-related QoL. Secondary outcomes were vomiting- and CINV-related QoL; anticipatory, acute, and delayed nausea and vomiting; fatigue; nutritional status; depression and anxiety; health-related QoL; and adverse events.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Uterine cervix tumors have an invasive nature, with the capacity to proliferate to surrounding organs such as the vagina, bladder, and rectum, as well as the capacity for dissemination and involvement of structures distant from its place of origin. According to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, patients with stages IB I, IB I microscopic (small dimension <4 cm) are indicated for radiotherapy or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin (40 mg/m2). However, cisplatin has side effects such as hematological implications (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia), gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation), and fatigue. Zingiber officinale contains bioactive compounds that act on pregnancy and postoperative nausea, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and also in the management of fatigue, myalgia, and insomnia. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of ginger on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with cervical cancer undergoing treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy. METHODS AND ANALYSES: A randomized intervention clinical and controlled trial with a triple-blind design is described, comparing the effects of institutional antiemetic therapy alone, as well as in combination with 2 different ginger concentrations.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate ginger's cardiovascular and metabolic effects (Zingiberofficinale) add-on therapy in type 2 diabetes patients over six weeks. METHODS: We performed a single-arm clinical trial. In well-to-moderately controlled Type 2 diabetic patients with unchanged treatment for at least three months, the intervention consisted of 6-week add-on oral supplementation of powdered ginger extracts in capsules at a dose of 399 mg three times per day. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), glycatedhaemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profile, kidney and liver function analysis were performed at initial and final visits, with a follow-up visit on day 21. Adherence to treatment, palatability and safety were also assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 21 participants (16 females) were included in the analysis. We found a non-significant decrease of E' wave from 0.05[0.04-0.09] to 0.06[0.05-0.7]cm/s, A-wave from 0.8[0.6-0.8] to 0.7[0.6-0.8] cm/s, and E-wave from 0.6[0.5-0.7] to 0.5[0.425-0.6]cm/s. There was a significant reduction of HbA1c from 49.7[47.0-57.4] to 44.3[38.8-53.0] mmol/mol and triglycerides from 1.6[1.4-1.9] to 1.2[0.9-1.8] mmol/l. A 5% decrease or more was observed for diurnal DBP, diurnal MAP and 24-hour DBP. CONCLUSION: Zingiberofficinale used as add-on therapy tend to improve diastolic function, blood pressure and lipid profile of type 2 diabetes patients. Further studies are needed to define the dosage and duration of this supplementary treatment accurately. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04222738.",research

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of ginger with P6 acupressure in preventing and treating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in cancer patients. METHOD: A total of 172 participants were randomly divided into the control, ginger, acupressure, and joint groups, who were hospitalized in the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University from February and September 2022. The baseline characteristics, nausea, vomiting, and retching, benefit finding, functional living index-emesis, treatment satisfaction, and adverse reaction, were used in data collection. RESULTS: No significant difference was found in benefit finding and adverse reactions among the four groups (P > 0.05). Ginger significantly improved delayed CINV and function living index-nausea (P < 0.05) but had no significant effect on acute CINV, retching, and delayed vomiting, functional living index-emesis, and treatment satisfaction (P>0.05). Acute nausea and retching, delayed nausea, vomiting, and retching, functional living index-emesis, and treatment satisfaction were effectively improved in the acupressure and joint groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Ginger with P6 acupressure may contribute to improving CINV in patients undergoing chemotherapy.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Despite compositional alterations in gastrointestinal microbiota being purported to underpin some of the therapeutic effects of ginger, the effect of a standardized ginger supplement on gut microbiota has not been tested in humans. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of a standardized ginger (Zingiber officinale) root powder, compared to placebo, on gastrointestinal bacteria and associated outcomes in healthy adults. METHODS: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial allocated participants aged 18 to 30 y to ginger or microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) placebo. The intervention comprised 1.2 g/d of ginger (4 capsules per day totaling 84 mg/d of active gingerols/shogaols) for 14 d following a 1-wk run-in period. Primary outcomes were gastrointestinal community composition, alpha and beta diversity, and differential abundance, measured using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples. Secondary outcomes were gastrointestinal symptoms, bowel function, depression, anxiety, stress, fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events. RESULTS: Fifty-one participants were enrolled and analyzed (71% female; mean age 25 ± 3 y; ginger: n = 29, placebo: n = 22). There was a greater increase in relative abundance of phylum, Actinobacteria, observed following ginger supplementation compared to placebo (U: 145.0; z: -2.1; P = 0.033). Ginger was associated with a greater abundance of the genera Parabacteroides, Bacillus, Ruminococcaceae incertae sedis, unclassified Bacilli, families Defluviitaleaceae, Morganellaceae, and Bacillaceae as well as lower abundance of the genus Blautia and family Sphingomonadaceae (P < 0.05).",research

Abstract: Introduction: different lines of evidence have shown that ginger administration may be beneficial for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of ginger supplementation on disability, physical and psychological quality of life (QoL), body mass index (BMI), neurofilament light chain (NfL), interlukin-17 (IL-17), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Methods: this was a 12 week double-blind parallel randomized placebo-controlled trial with a 3 week run-in period. The treatment (n = 26) and control (n = 26) groups received 500 mg ginger and placebo (corn) supplements 3 times daily, respectively. Disability was evaluated using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). QoL was rated using the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29). BMI was calculated by dividing weight by height squared. Serum levels of NfL, IL-17, and MMP-9 were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. NLR was determined using a Sysmex XP-300™ automated hematology analyzer. All outcomes were assessed before and after the intervention and analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle. Results: in comparison with placebo, ginger supplementation caused a significant reduction in the EDSS (-0.54 ± 0.58 vs. 0.08 ± 0.23, P < 0.001), the MSIS-29 physical scale (-8.15 ± 15.75 vs. 4.23 ± 8.46, P = 0.001), the MSIS-29 psychological scale (-15.71 ± 19.59 vs. 6.68 ± 10.41, P < 0.001), NfL (-0.14 ± 0.97 vs. 0.38 ± 1.06 ng mL-1, P = 0.049), IL-17 (-3.34 ± 4.06 vs. 1.77 ± 6.51 ng L-1, P = 0.003), and NLR (-0.09 ± 0.53 vs. 0.53 ± 1.90, P = 0.038). Nevertheless, the differences in BMI and MMP-9 were not significant between the groups.

Abstract: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a highly prevalent chronic skin disease. Anti-inflammatory and antipruritic emollients (emollients plus) with excellent cosmetic properties may alleviate AD-related symptoms and reduce the number of exacerbations. To screen for herbal extracts with potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidative potential in human skin cell cultures. Ginger extract and synthetic cannabidiol (CBD) were identified and combined in the cosmetic product BNO 3731, which was evaluated in a randomized clinical trial. Preclinical: anti-inflammatory effects of ginger extract, synthetic CBD and a combination thereof were evaluated in human skin cell cultures by analysing nuclear factor κB activation, release of inflammatory cytokines and endocannabinoid production. Clinical: BNO 3731 was studied in a clinical trial comprising 44 AD patients (adults and children) and compared to a benchmark product over a treatment duration of five days. Symptom severity was evaluated by objective and subjective dermatological assessments as well as physiological skin parameters. Itch intensity was assessed using a numerical rating scale (NRS-11). Preclinical: Ginger extract and synthetic CBD exhibited potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects in vitro which were associated with elevated concentrations of the endocannabinoid, anandamide. Clinical: BNO 3731 significantly alleviated symptoms of AD and improved physiological skin parameters. Itch intensity decreased significantly by 55%, and in 75% of subjects, itch improved ≥2 points on the NRS-11 scale. No adverse events were reported.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ginger, a potent antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant remedy, is a potential therapeutic option for COVID-19. However, there was not enough clinical evidence about ginger and COVID-19. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of ginger on clinical and paraclinical features in outpatients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, the outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive ginger (1000 mg 3 times a day for 7 days) or placebo. The primary outcome was viral clearance after the end of the intervention. Oxygen saturation (SPO2), body temperature, respiratory rate (RR), hospital admission, and the incidence of adverse events were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients (42 in the ginger and 42 in the control groups) were randomized. The viral clearance was not statistically improved in the ginger group (41.6%) compared to the placebo group (42.8%). The findings indicated that SPO2, body temperature, and RR had no significant difference between the groups at the end of the intervention. The imaging finding indicated pulmonary infiltrate significantly reduced on the 7th day of the intervention in the ginger group. The percentage of patients with SPO2 <96% in the ginger group decreased over the study compared to the placebo group. Moreover, the need for hospital admission and the incidence of adverse drug events were not different between the groups over the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Ginger had no significant impact on the clinical and paraclinical parameters of patients. However, this intervention demonstrated a safe profile of adverse events and reduced pulmonary infiltrate.",research

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Nutraceuticals are gaining more and more importance as a knee osteoarthritis (KOA) complementary treatment. Among nutraceuticals, hemp seed oil and terpenes are proving to be very useful as therapeutic support for many chronic diseases, but there are still few studies regarding their effectiveness for treating KOA, both in combination and separately. The aim of this study is thus to compare the effect of two dietary supplements, both containing hemp seed oil, but of which only one also contains terpenes, in relieving pain and improving joint function in patients suffering from KOA. Materials and Methods: Thirty-eight patients were recruited and divided into two groups. The control group underwent a 45 day treatment with a hemp seed oil-based dietary supplement, while the treatment group assumed a hemp seed oil and terpenes dietary supplement for the same period. Patients were evaluated at the enrollment (T0) and at the end of treatment (T1). Outcome measures were: Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Short-Form-12 (SF-12), Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Oxford Knee Score (OKS). Results: All outcome measures improved at T1 in both groups, but NRS, KOOS and OKS had a greater significant improvement in the treatment group only. Conclusions: Hemp seed oil and terpenes resulted a more effective integrative treatment option in KOA, improving joint pain and function and representing a good complementary option for patients suffering from osteoarthritis.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ginger and aloe vera are two medicinal herbs mostly used to produce mouthwash. This study aimed to compare the effects of ginger and aloe vera mouthwashes on the xerostomia in patients referred to Bandar Abbas diabetes clinic (Iran). MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this triple-blind clinical trial, three groups (n=35 patients in each group) were studied. One group was given aloe vera mouthwash, the other group used ginger mouthwash, and the control group was only given normal saline. All the mouthwashes were used 20 ccs three times daily for 14 consecutive days. The symptoms and severity of xerostomia were measured before and after the intervention by the questionnaire proposed by Fox et al. as well as VAS scale, respectively. Statistical analysis, including the Shapiro-Wilk test used to measure the normality of variables, and Chi-square and McNemar used to compare the scores questionnaire proposed by Fox et al., were also applied. Scores of VAS were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA test. P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant in all these tests. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants included in the normal saline group was 58.13±14.75 years old, 54.14±9.35 years old in the ginger group, and 53.37±11.57 years old in the aloe vera group. The difference between the scores of xerostomia before and after performing the intervention (The amount of reduction in xerostomia) in the ginger group was 6.12±2.004 cm, in the aloe vera group it was 4.08±2.09 cm, and in the normal saline group it was 2.45±2.09 cm. Finally, the ginger and aloe vera mouthwashes significantly reduced all symptoms and severity related to xerostomia, respectively(p<0.001).",research

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To prove the hypothesis that beetroot, watermelon and ginger juice supplementation improves the endometrial receptivity and clinical outcomes of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. METHODS: This prospective randomized study enrolled 436 female patients undergoing ICSI cycles from January/2018 to June/2021, in a private university-affiliated IVF center. Female patients were randomized in a 1:3 ratio to either Control (n=109) or Supplementation Group (n=327). All patients received nutritional orientation before the beginning of the treatment. Participants in the Supplementation Group were instructed to intake a daily dose of homemade juice, prepared with fresh beetroot, watermelon and ginger, from the day of embryo transfer until the day of pregnancy test, while patients in Control Group did not follow the juice protocol. Generalized Linear Models, adjusted for potential confounders (female age, body mass index - BMI, endometrial thickness upon embryo transfer, and number of transferred embryos), followed by Bonferroni post hoc test for the comparison of means between groups, were used to investigate the impact of juice supplementation on the clinical outcomes of ICSI. RESULTS: Patients and cycles characteristics were equally distributed among Supplementation and Control groups. Implantation rate (25.2% vs. 20.5%, p<0.001) and clinical pregnancy rate (41.0% vs. 22.0%, p=0.039) were significantly higher in the Supplementation compared to the Control group.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of frankincense (Boswellia serrata, oleoresin) and ginger (Zingiber officinale, rhizoma) as complementary treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) among women of reproductive age. DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial. SETTING: Gynecology outpatient clinics. INTERVENTIONS: Patients with HMB (n = 102) were randomly assigned to three groups. All patients received ibuprofen (200 mg) and either frankincense (300 mg), ginger (300 mg), or a placebo, which contains 200 mg anhydrous lactose as the filling agent and was similar in appearance to the two other drugs. Patients received the medications three times a day for seven days of the menstrual cycle, starting from the first bleeding day and this was repeated for two consecutive menstrual cycles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Amount and duration of menstrual bleeding and quality of life (QOL). RESULTS: Duration of menstrual bleeding was decreased in the frankincense (-1.77 ± 2.47 days, P = 0.003) and ginger (-1.8 ± 1.79 days, P = 0.001) groups, but not in the placebo group (-0.52 ± 1.86 days, P = 0.42).

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to compare the effect of mefenamic acid and ginger on pain management in primary dysmenorrhea. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-two female students with moderate to severe primary dysmenorrhea were randomly allocated to the ginger and mefenamic groups in a randomized clinical trial. The mefenamic group received 250 mg capsules every 8 h, and the ginger group received 250 mg capsules (zintoma) every 6 h from the onset of menstruation until pain relief lasted 2 cycles. The intensity of pain was assessed by the visual analog scale. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, t test, Chi-square, Fisher exact test and repeated measurement. RESULTS: The pain intensity in the mefenamic and ginger group was 39.01 ± 17.77 and 43.49 ± 19.99, respectively, in the first month, and 33.75 ± 17.71 and 38.19 ± 20.47, respectively, in the second month (p > 0.05). The severity of dysmenorrhea, pain duration, cycle duration and bleeding volume was not significantly different between groups during the study. The menstrual days were more in the ginger group in the first (p = 0.01) and second cycle (p = 0.04). Repeated measurement showed a significant difference in pain intensity within the groups by time, but not between groups.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Supplements are commonly used by individuals with indications for lipid-lowering therapy, but evidence of their effectiveness to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is lacking, particularly when compared with statins. OBJECTIVES: The trial objective was to compare the efficacy of a low-dose statin with placebo and 6 common supplements in impacting lipid and inflammatory biomarkers. METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective, randomized, single-blind clinical trial among adults with no history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), an LDL-C of 70 to 189 mg/dL, and an increased 10-year risk of ASCVD. Participants were randomized to rosuvastatin 5 mg daily, placebo, fish oil, cinnamon, garlic, turmeric, plant sterols, or red yeast rice. The primary endpoint was the percent change in LDL-C from baseline for rosuvastatin 5 mg daily compared with placebo and each supplement after 28 days. The primary endpoint was evaluated in a hierarchical fashion with rosuvastatin first compared with placebo, then each supplement in a prespecified order using analysis of covariance. RESULTS: A total of 190 participants completed the study. The percent LDL-C reduction with rosuvastatin was greater than all supplements and placebo (P < 0.001). The difference in LDL-C reduction with rosuvastatin compared with placebo was -35.2% (95% CI: -41.3% to -29.1%; P < 0.001). None of the dietary supplements demonstrated a significant decrease in LDL-C compared with placebo. Adverse event rates were similar across study groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with increased 10-year risk for ASCVD, rosuvastatin 5 mg daily lowered LDL-C significantly more than placebo, fish oil, cinnamon, garlic, turmeric, plant sterols, and red yeast rice.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To compare the efficacy and safety of bioavailable turmeric extract versus paracetamol in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: In this randomized, non-inferiority, controlled clinical study, patients of knee OA were randomized to receive bioavailable turmeric extract (BCM-95®) 500 mg capsule two times daily or paracetamol 650 mg tablet three times daily for 6 weeks. The primary outcome measure was Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale. The secondary outcome measures were WOMAC total, WOMAC stiffness, and WOMAC physical function scores. Responder analysis of individual patients at different levels (≥ 20%, ≥ 50%, and ≥ 70%) for WOMAC score was calculated. TNF alpha and CRP levels were evaluated and adverse events (AE) were also recorded. RESULTS: Seventy-one and seventy-three knee OA patients, respectively in bioavailable turmeric extract and paracetamol groups, completed the study. Non-inferiority (equivalence) test showed that WOMAC scores were equivalent in both the groups (p value < 0.05) in all the domains within the equivalence limit defined by effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.5 whereas CRP and TNF-α were better reduced with turmeric extract than paracetamol. After 6 weeks of treatment, WOMAC total score, pain, stiffness, and function scores got a significant improvement of 23.59, 32.09, 28.5, and 20.25% respectively with turmeric extract. In the turmeric extract group, 18% of patients got more than 50% improvement and 3% of patients got more than 70% improvement in WOMAC pain and function/stiffness score and none of the patients in the paracetamol group met the criteria. CRP and TNF-α got significantly reduced (37.21 and 74.81% respectively) in the turmeric extract group.",research

Abstract: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and primary dysmenorrhea are common complaints among young women. This study evaluated the effects of curcumin supplements on symptoms of pain in young women with PMS and dysmenorrhea. A randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was undertaken. Women who suffered from both PMS and dysmenorrhea were enrolled, and were randomly allocated to the curcumin (n = 62), or placebo (n = 62) groups. Each subject received one capsule (500 mg of curcuminoid, or placebo) daily, from 7 days pre- until 3 days post-menstruation for three successive menstrual cycles. Participants recorded the severity of PMS, or dysmenorrhea using a Premenstrual Syndrome Screening Tool (PSST) and the visual analog scale, respectively. Baseline characteristics of participants did not differ between the curcumin and placebo groups. At the end of the trial, the PSST scores were significantly lower in both the curcumin (32.5 ± 9.8 vs. 21.6 ± 9.8); and placebo groups (31.7 ± 9.4 vs. 23.4 ± 12.8). There was a significant reduction of dysmenorrhea pain in both the curcumin and placebo groups (by 64% and 53.3%, respectively). Hence, curcumin had comparable effects as placebo, regarding the amelioration of symptoms of PMS and dysmenorrhea. Further studies are required with larger samples, using higher doses curcumin for longer durations, and perhaps in combination therapy.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Curcumin is a biologically active phytochemical ingredient found in turmeric. It has several pharmacologic effects that might benefit patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized curcumin to be effective in improving blood sugar levels, insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism in individuals with PCOS. METHODS: In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, individuals with PCOS were treated with curcumin (500 mg three times daily) or placebo for 12 weeks. Primary outcome measures were fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin (FI), sex hormone levels, and hirsutism (Ferriman-Gallwey [mFG] score). Secondary outcomes included anthropometric measurements. RESULTS: Of 72 randomized individuals, 67 completed the trial. The two groups were comparable at baseline. At the end of the study, FPG and Dehydroepiandrosterone levels had decreased significantly in the intervention group compared to control (difference of change (post-pre) between intervention and placebo groups: -4.11 mg/dL; 95% CI: -8.35, -0.35 mg/dL; p = 0.033 and -26.53 microg/dL; 95% CI: -47.99, -4.34 µg/dL; p = 0.035, respectively). We also observed a statistically non-significant increase (p = 0.082) in Estradiol levels in the intervention group compared to control. No serious adverse events were reported throughout the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Curcumin might be a safe and useful supplement to ameliorate PCOS-associated hyperandrogenemia and hyperglycemia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is preliminary evidence to suggest curcumin can alleviate digestive symptoms in adults with self-reported digestive complaints and irritable bowel syndrome. However, in all these trials, curcumin was used as a component of a multi-herbal combination and there were consistent concerns associated with risk of bias in most studies. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of a curcumin extract (Curcugen™) on gastrointestinal symptoms, mood, and overall quality of life in adults presenting with self-reported digestive complaints. Moreover, to determine the potential therapeutic mechanisms of action associated with curcumin, its effects on intestinal microbiota and small intestinal bowel overgrowth (SIBO) were examined. METHODS: In this 8-week, parallel-group, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, 79 adults with self-reported digestive complaints were recruited and randomised to receive either a placebo or 500 mg of the curcumin extract, Curcugen™. Outcome measures included the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), intestinal microbial profile (16S rRNA), Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 (DASS-21), Short Form-36 (SF-36), and SIBO breath test. RESULTS: Based on self-report data collected from 77 participants, curcumin was associated with a significantly greater reduction in the GSRS total score compared to the placebo. There was also a greater reduction in the DASS-21 anxiety score. No other significant between-group changes in self-report data were identified. An examination of changes in the intestinal microbial profile and SIBO test revealed curcumin had no significant effect on these parameters.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aging is the primary risk factor for developing non-communicable chronic diseases, necessitating interventions targeting the aging process. Outcome measures of biological aging used in these interventions are mathematical algorithms applied to DNA methylation patterns, known as epigenetic clocks. The Methylation Diet and Lifestyle study was a pilot randomized controlled trial of a diet and lifestyle intervention that utilized epigenetic age as its primary outcome, measured using Horvath's clock. Significant reductions in epigenetic age post-intervention were observed but with notable variability. PURPOSE: This research aimed to identify dietary components associated with epigenetic age change across groups. Contributing factors to variability, such as weight changes and baseline differences in chronological and epigenetic age, were explored. RESULTS: In hierarchical linear regression, foods investigated as polyphenolic modulators of DNA methylation (green tea, oolong tea, turmeric, rosemary, garlic, berries) categorized in the original study as methyl adaptogens showed significant linear associations with epigenetic age change (B = -1.24, CI = [-2.80, -0.87]), after controlling for baseline epigenetic age acceleration and weight changes. Although the intervention group lost significantly more weight than the control group, these changes were not associated with epigenetic age changes in the regression model. These findings suggest that consuming foods categorized as methyl adaptogens may reduce markers of epigenetic aging.",research

Abstract: PURPOSE: Turmeric has renop rotective effects that can act to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Piperine has been indicated as a bioavailability enhancer of turmeric and consequently of its biological effects. However, data on the efficacy of the turmeric/piperine combination in HD patients are limited. We aimed to verify whether turmeric supplementation in combination with piperine has a superior effect to turmeric alone in increasing antioxidant capacity and reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in HD patients. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted in HD patients (age 20-75 years). Patients were supplemented with turmeric (3 g/day) or turmeric/piperine (3 g turmeric + 2 mg piperine/day) for 12 weeks. Malondialdehyde (MDA), antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and ferritin were evaluated at baseline and the end of the study. RESULTS: There was a reduction in the MDA and ferritin levels in the turmeric/piperine group and in the comparison between groups at the end of the study [MDA: -0.08(-0.14/0.01) nmol/mL versus -0.003(-0.10/0.26) nmol/mL, p = 0.003; ferritin: -193.80 ± 157.29 mg/mL versus 51.99 ± 293.25 mg/mL, p = 0.018].

Abstract: A recent randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study conducted by our research group, provided partial support for the efficacy of supplementation with a patented curcumin extract (500 mg, twice daily) for 8 weeks in reducing depressive symptoms in people with major depressive disorder. In the present paper, a secondary, exploratory analysis of salivary, urinary and blood biomarkers collected during this study was conducted to identify potential antidepressant mechanisms of action of curcumin. Pre and post-intervention samples were provided by 50 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder, and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-rated version (IDS-SR30) was used as the primary depression outcome measure. Compared to placebo, 8 weeks of curcumin supplementation was associated with elevations in urinary thromboxane B2 (p<0.05), and substance P (p<0.001); while placebo supplementation was associated with reductions in aldosterone (p<0.05) and cortisol (p<0.05). Higher baseline plasma endothelin-1 (rs=-0.587; p<0.01) and leptin (rs=-0.470; p<0.05) in curcumin-treated individuals was associated with greater reductions in IDS-SR30 score after 8 weeks of treatment. Our findings demonstrate that curcumin supplementation influences several biomarkers that may be associated with its antidepressant mechanisms of action. Plasma concentrations of leptin and endothelin-1 seem to have particular relevance to treatment outcome. Further investigations using larger samples sizes are required to elucidate these findings, as the multiple statistical comparisons completed in this study increased the risk of type I errors.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Robust evidence has related yellow passion fruit albedo and long turmeric to the metabolic and glycemic control of diabetes. AIM: To analyze the incremental cost-effectiveness of the flour made from yellow passion fruit albedo  METHOD: Eighty-nine patients were enrolled in this randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial for 120 days. The first group was prescribed 500 mg capsules, three times a day, of yellow passion fruit albedo flour (FAMA). The second group was prescribed long turmeric capsules (500 mg), merged with piperine (5 mg) (CURPI), at fasting. The third group followed the standard advice recommendations, and ingested a placebo of carboxymethyl cellulose (500 mg) at fasting. RESULTS: The group using FAMA showed a higher reduction (-5.9%) of glycemia after fasting, compared to placebo (+9%), and CURPI (-3.2%) (p < 0.05). Regarding HbA1c, the study observed a significant and similar statistical reduction (-0.8%) in the intervention groups, in contrast with the placebo group (p < 0.05). The reduction in HOMA-IR in the CURPI group (-9.4%) was higher than the other groups (p < 0.05). The CURPI group also showed a higher reduction of serum triglyceride levels (-20.8%) compared to the placebo (-0.09%) and FAMA (+1.8%) (p < 0.05) groups. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that turmeric is the most cost-effective in comparison with yellow passion fruit albedo, because of its decrease in the levels of triglycerides and HOMA-IR, even when adjusted for confounding variables.

RESULTS: At 4 weeks, compared to baseline, Black seed and Turmeric alone showed improvement in BMI, WC and BF%. Combination improved all parameters except HDL-cholesterol with lower FBG and LDL-cholesterol as compared to placebo. At 8 weeks, compared to placebo, Black seeds reduced lipids and FBG, while Turmeric reduced LDL-cholesterol and CRP. Interestingly, combination group with 60% dose of the individual herbs showed an improvement in all parameters from baseline. When compared to placebo, it reduced BF%, FBG, cholesterol, TG, LDL-cholesterol, CRP and raised HDL-cholesterol. CONCLUSION: Turmeric and Black seeds showed improvement in all parameters of metabolic syndrome, when co-administered at 60% of doses of individual herbs with enhanced efficacy and negligible adverse-effects. The combination of Black seeds and Turmeric can therefore, be recommended with lifestyle modification as a starting point for patients with MetS to halt its future complications and progression.",research

Abstract: Gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) is the fourth leading global cause of cancer mortality and leading infection-associated cancer. High-incidence regions of GAC include Latin America and Eastern Asia. Immigrants from high-incidence regions maintain their GAC risk. GAC is a major U.S. cancer disparity, and its incidence rates are 2 to 10 times higher in non-White populations. Emerging guidelines recommend 3-year surveillance endoscopy for patients with high-risk gastric premalignant conditions (GPMC). Clinical trials of GPMC chemoprevention agents are lacking. We conducted a NCI Division of Cancer Prevention-funded, phase II placebo-controlled chemoprevention trial in patients with GPMCs (atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia) with a highly bioavailable preparation of curcuminoids (Meriva). The trial sites in Puerto Rico and rural Honduras had important characteristics: (i) representative Caribbean and Mesoamerican populations, linked to large U.S. immigrant populations; (ii) high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection and GPMCs; (iii) the absence of turmeric and curcuminoids in local diets; and (iv) proven bidirectional collaboration with U.S. academic institutions. H. pylori-negative patients with GPMCs were randomized to the study drug (500 mg po bid) or placebo for 180 days (NCT02782949), with primary outcomes based upon histologic parameters. Principal study challenges included (i) an international regulatory environment; (ii) research infrastructure strengthening, particularly in Central America; (iii) participant recruitment in Honduras, wherein only 10% to 15% are H. pylori negative; (iv) the COVID-19 pandemic; and (v) natural disasters (three hurricanes).",research

Abstract: This study investigated the effects of two dosages (750 mg and 1500 mg) of hydrolyzed curcumin on physiological recovery following exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD). In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind design, 34 recreationally active males (27 ± 6 years; 180 ± 7.3 cm; 82 ± 11.3 kg) were assigned to three groups: PLA (2 × 750-mg/day placebo), LOW (1 × 750-mg/day curcumin + 1 × 750-mg/day placebo), and HIGH (2 × 750-mg/day curcumin). Supplements were delivered in 15 mL gel sachets over 7 days, starting 48 h before EIMD. The EIMD protocol involved 8 sets of 10 repetitions at 110% of one-repetition maximum on the leg press, with 5-s eccentric phases and assisted concentric phases, targeting the quadriceps. Recovery was assessed pre, post, 24, 48, and 72 h post-EIMD via the Free Oxygen Radical Test (FORT), creatine kinase (CK), interleukin-6 (IL-6), isokinetic peak power, and a muscle endurance test (sustained isometric contraction at 50% peak torque). The HIGH group showed significantly greater reductions in pain, CK, FORT, and IL-6 (p < 0.05), but slower muscle endurance recovery at 24 h compared to LOW. Findings suggest a dose-response effect, with higher curcumin doses improving biochemical recovery but potentially impairing performance recovery.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intravesical instillation of hyaluronic acid (HA) has been associated with reduced sexual dysfunction in participants with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs), but the efficacy of an oral treatment has never been investigated. AIM: To investigate the efficacy of an oral preparation of HA, chondroitin sulfate, N-acetylglucosamine, and vitamin C in improving sexual and urinary symptoms in a cohort of reproductive-age participants with rUTI. METHODS: In a monocentric randomized crossover pilot trial, participants with rUTI who were referred to our institute between March 2022 and April 2023 were randomized 1:1 in 2 groups: intervention vs control. All participants had an oral preparation of cranberry, D-mannose, propolis extract, turmeric, and Boswellia twice a day for 3 months. The intervention group also included an oral preparation of HA, chondroitin sulfate, N-acetylglucosamine, and vitamin C once a day for 3 months. Crossover of treatment occurred at 3 months for an additional 3 months. At baseline and 3 and 6 months, participants were evaluated clinically and with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models tested the impact of the intervention on urinary and sexual symptoms at each follow-up assessment. OUTCOMES: Improvement in sexual and urinary symptoms as measured by the FSFI and IPSS. RESULTS: Overall, 27 (54%) participants had an FSFI score <26.5 at enrollment. At 3 months, FSFI scores were higher in the intervention group vs control (P < .001), but IPSS scores were lower (P = .03).",research

In logistic regression analyses, the intervention group was associated with early improvement in sexual symptoms (odds ratio, 3.9; P = .04) and urinary symptoms (odds ratio, 5.1; P = .01) after accounting for clinical confounders. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Combination treatment with HA, chondroitin sulfate, N-acetylglucosamine, and vitamin C is effective if started immediately or even after a few months from symptoms in participants with rUTI. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: The main limitation is the lack of long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: The oral formulation of HA, chondroitin sulfate, N-acetylglucosamine, and vitamin C could be an effective therapy against urinary and sexual distress in participants with rUTI (NCT06268483; ClinicalTrials.gov).",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND & AIMS: Turmeric (a source of curcumin) is an excellent food to modulate oxidative stress, inflammation, and gut dysbiosis in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, no studies report the benefits of curcumin in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). This study aims to evaluate the effects of curcuminoid supplementation on oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, and uremic toxins originating from gut microbiota in patients with CKD undergoing PD. METHODS: This longitudinal, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated 48 patients who were randomized into two groups: Curcumin (three capsules of 500 mg of Curcuma longa extract, with 98.42 % total curcuminoids) or placebo (three capsules of 500 mg of starch) for twelve weeks. In the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the transcriptional expression levels of Nrf2, HOX-1 and NF-κB were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR. Oxidative stress was evaluated by malondialdehyde (MDA) and total Thiol (T-SH). TNF-α and IL-6 plasma levels were measured by ELISA. P-cresyl sulphate plasma level, a uremic toxin, was evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescent detection. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients finished the study: 10 in the curcumin group (57.5 ± 11.6 years) and 14 in the placebo group (56.5 ± 10.0 years). The plasma levels of MDA were reduced after 12 weeks in the curcumin group (p = 0.01), while the placebo group remained unchanged. However, regarding the difference between the groups at the endpoint, no change was observed in MDA. Still, there was a trend to reduce the p-CS plasma levels in the curcumin group compared to the placebo group (p = 0.07).",research

Abstract: IMPORTANCE: While vitamin D supplementation and exercise are recommended for prevention of falls for older people, results regarding these 2 factors are contradictory. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of targeted exercise training and vitamin D supplementation in reducing falls and injurious falls among older women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 2-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled vitamin D and open exercise trial conducted between April 2010 and March 2013 in Tampere, Finland. Participants were 409 home-dwelling women 70 to 80 years old. The main inclusion criteria were at least 1 fall during the previous year, no use of vitamin D supplements, and no contraindication to exercise. INTERVENTIONS: Four study groups, including placebo without exercise, vitamin D (800 IU/d) without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D (800 IU/d) and exercise. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was monthly reported falls. Injurious falls and the number of fallers and injured fallers were reported as secondary outcomes. In addition, bone density, physical functioning (muscle strength, balance, and mobility), and vitamin D metabolism were assessed. RESULTS: Intent-to-treat analyses showed that neither vitamin D nor exercise reduced falls. Fall rates per 100 person-years were 118.2, 132.1, 120.7, and 113.1 in the placebo without exercise, vitamin D without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D and exercise study groups, respectively; however, injurious fall rates were 13.2, 12.9, 6.5, and 5.0, respectively. Hazard ratios for injured fallers were significantly lower among exercisers with vitamin D (0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.83) and without vitamin D (0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.99).",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is often responsible for bone fragility and increased fracture risk due to the micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue. In addition to nutritional supplements, exercise is considered an adjunct factor in safeguarding bone health. This study aimed to investigate the effects of 16-week high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral density (BMD) in women with osteoporosis. TRIAL DESIGN: This study used a four-arm pretest-posttest experimental randomized controlled design. METHODS: One hundred twenty sedentary women aged (30-50 years), diagnosed with osteoporosis were recruited in this study. Patients were randomly classified into four groups with 30 patients in each group: control group (normal daily activities), exercise group (HIIT-exercise for 16 weeks), Vitamin D group (vitamin D 800IU/ day for 16 weeks), and concurrent group (HIIT exercise plus vitamin D for 16 weeks). Anthropometric measurements, BMD, and serum levels of vitamin 25-(OH) D, Osteocalcin, s-BAP, and calcium were estimated in all participants before and after exercise training. RESULTS: Serum samples revealed that bone resorption markers, osteocalcin, total calcium, s-BAP, and vitamin 25(OH) D significantly improved in all groups; there was greater improvement in the HIIT training-vitamin D group than in the HIIT training, vitamin D, and control groups. Furthermore, the HIIT training-vitamin D group showed improvements in hip (right and left) and lumbar spine BMD than the HIIT training, Vitamin D, and Control groups. BMD improvements correlated positively with serum osteocalcin levels and total calcium and negatively with BMI and s-BAP.",research

The effect of vitamin D supplementation on treatment of depression in older adults was investigated in this clinical trial. METHODS: It was an 8-week, randomized clinical trial of vitamin D supplementation and placebo in the treatment of depression in 3 psychiatric clinics. The study sample included 78 older adults aged over 60 years with moderate to severe depression. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive 50,000 U vitamin D3 pearl weekly for 8 weeks or placebo (39 subjects in each group). Main outcome measures comprised Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15) questionnaire and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3]. The analysis utilized Mann Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed ranks test, chi-square and multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: The mean baseline 25(OH)D3 concentration was 22.57 ± 6.2 ng/ml in vitamin D group and 21.2 ± 5.8 ng/ml in placebo group (p = 0.16).

Abstract: Vitamin D has a crucial role in female reproduction, possibly through its effects on calcium homeostasis, cyclic sex steroid hormone fluctuations, or neurotransmitter function. We have assessed the effects of vitamin D supplementation on dysmenorrhea and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in adolescents. In this study, 897 adolescent girls living in Mashhad and Sabzevar, Iran, received nine high-dose vitamin D supplements (as 50,000 IU/week of cholecalciferol) and were followed up over 9 weeks. We evaluated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on individuals in four categories: those with only PMS; individuals with only dysmenorrhea; subjects with both PMS and dysmenorrhea and normal subjects. The prevalence of PMS after the intervention fell from 14.9% to 4.8% (p < .001). Similar results were also found for the prevalence of subjects with dysmenorrhea (35.9% reduced to 32.4%), and in subjects with both PMS and dysmenorrhea (32.7% reduced 25.7%). Vitamin D supplementation was associated with a reduction in the incidence of several symptoms of PMS such as backache and tendency to cry easily as well as decrement in pain severity of dysmenorrhea (p < .05). High dose vitamin D supplementation can reduce the prevalence of PMS and dysmenorrhea as well as has positive effects on the physical and psychological symptoms of PMS.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The prevalence of vitamin D supplementation and the percentage of participants with a lack of appropriate vitamin D supplementation (""potential underuse"") or potentially inappropriate vitamin D supplementation (""potential overuse"") and risk factors for these are currently unclear. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis from the OPERAM study, a multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial in four European countries (Belgium, Ireland, The Netherlands, Switzerland) including multimorbid (≥ 3 chronic conditions) older patients, with polypharmacy (≥ 5 chronic medications). For the definition of potential underuse and overuse we used high-risk conditions, which were defined according to the START criteria (version 2) for potential prescribing omissions in older people i.e., E2) long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy, known osteoporosis or osteopenia, E3) previous fragility fractures, and E5) housebound/in nursing homes or experiencing falls. We used mixed effect logistic regression to identify factors associated with underuse and overuse. RESULTS: 2008 patients (79.4y, SD 6.3, 45% female) were included. 825/2008 (41.1%) were supplemented with vitamin D. We identified 681 participants with potential underuse (33.9% of all participants, 69.7% of non-vitamin D users) and 204 with potential overuse (10.2% of all participants, 24.7% of vitamin D users). In the multivariable logistic regression analysis increasing age and being male were associated with underuse, while the number of baseline medications and previous hospitalizations were associated with both underuse and overuse. Specifically, underuse decreased with an increasing number of medications (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.90-0.95), while overuse increased (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.04-1.12).",research

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the effects of vitamin D supplementation on metabolic parameters in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). METHODS: A total of 60 PCOS women with vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency were enrolled in this randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomized to vitamin D group (2000 IU/day) or control group. The observational parameters were measured at baseline and after treatment, including body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR), oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin release test, and lipid metabolism parameters. RESULTS: The serum 25(OH)D concentrations at different time points after vitamin D supplementation were significantly higher than that in control group (P < 0.05). The BMI, WHR, insulin concentrations, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations in women of Vitamin D group after 12 weeks of treatment were significantly lower than that in women of control group (P < 0.05). The serum insulin concentrations and HOMA-IR at different time points of OGTT, serum TG, TC and LDL-C concentrations in women of vitamin D group (obesity) were significantly lower compared with control group (obesity) (P < 0.05). The BMI, WHR, TG, TC and LDL-C concentration in women of vitamin D group (IR) were significantly lower compared with control group (IR) (P < 0.05). No significant difference was observed in metabolic parameters between vitamin D group (non-obesity) and control group (non-obesity) (P > 0.05), and these differences of metabolic parameters were also not observed between vitamin D group (non-IR) and control group (non-IR) (P > 0.05).",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The relationship between vitamin D and sarcopenia was inconsistent between men and women. Physical activity (PA) may interact with vitamin D on sarcopenia. However, the sex-specific relationships of vitamin D, PA and sarcopenia have yet elucidated. We aimed to examine the sex differences in the relation between vitamin D status, PA levels, obesity and sarcopenia in community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults, as well as whether vitamin D status is a modifier in the relationship between PA and sarcopenia. METHODS: The current study was a cross-sectional study based on the baseline survey of the West China Health and Aging Trend (WCHAT) study. A total of 3713 participants aged ≥ 50y were included in our study. Sarcopenia was defined according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) 2019 consensus. Obesity was defined by body mass index (BMI) (≥ 28 kg/m2) and body fat mass percentage (≥ 60th percentile in each sex group). 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay and PA was evaluated by a validated China Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (CLTPAQ). Multinomial logistic regression was performed to examine the relationship between PA, vitamin D and sarcopenia and obesity. RESULTS: Low PA was significantly associated with higher odds of sarcopenia in women only (OR = 1.70,95%CI:1.18,2.46, p < 0.01). Vitamin D deficiency was only associated with sarcopenia in men (OR = 1.85,95%CI: 1.27,2.69, p < 0.01). Low PA was significantly associated with obesity, sarcopenia, and sarcopenic obesity only in participants with serum 25(OH)D < 20 ng/ml.",research

Abstract: COVID-19 symptoms vary from asymptomatic cases to moderate and severe illness with patients needing hospitalization and intensive care treatment. Vitamin D is associated with severity of viral infections and has an immune-modulatory effect in immune response. Observational studies showed a negative association of low vitamin D levels and COVID-19 severity and mortality outcomes. In this study, we aimed to determine whether daily supplementation of vitamin D during intensive care unit (ICU) stay in COVID-19 patients with severe illness affects clinically relevant outcomes. Patients with COVID-19 disease in need of respiratory support admitted to the ICU were eligible for inclusion. Patients with low vitamin D levels were randomized into one of two groups: the intervention group received daily supplementation of vitamin D and the control group did not receive vitamin D supplementation. In total, 155 patients were randomized: 78 into the intervention group and 77 into the control group. There was no statistically significant difference in number of days spent on respiratory support, although the trial was underpowered for the main outcome. There was no difference in any of the secondary outcomes analyzed between two groups. Our study suggests no benefit in vitamin D supplementation to patients with severe COVID-19 disease admitted to the ICU and in need of respiratory support in any of the analyzed outcomes.",research

Abstract: Vitamin D is reported to have anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects, yet vitamin D effects on hepatic fat content in children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are not studied sufficiently. We aimed to evaluate the role of vitamin D supplementation on the hepatic fat content and NAFLD progression in children. This randomized controlled clinical trial was performed on 109 children with biopsy-proven NAFLD; only 100 patients completed the study. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups: the treatment group who received 2000 IU/day vitamin D for 6 months and the control group who received a placebo. Anthropometric measurements, vitamin D levels, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total cholesterol (TC), serum triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting blood insulin level (FBI), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and serum calcium level were measured at the beginning and the end of the study. Liver biopsy was taken before and at the end of the study for all included children. There was a significant improvement of the hepatic steatosis and lobular inflammation by liver biopsy in the treatment group after treatment. However, there was no significant effect on the hepatocyte ballooning or hepatic fibrosis. There were significant decrease of AST, ALT, TG, LDL, FBG, FBI, and HOMA-IR and significant increase of vitamin D levels and HDL in the treatment group compared to the placebo group (P < 0.05).Conclusion: Vitamin D supplementation was found to be beneficial in the treatment of NAFLD in children.Trial registration: www.pactr.org , PACTR201710002634203.",research

Abstract: This study aimed to gain deeper knowledge about the relationship between vitamin D and physical activity in a sample of forensic inpatients. Sixty-seven male forensic inpatients participated. Participants were randomly assigned into an Intervention group (vitamin D) or a Control group (placebo). The Physical Activity-Rating (PA-R) questionnaire was used to measure physical activity from January to May. Vitamin D status was measured as 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OHD) pre- and post-intervention. The results revealed that vitamin D status at post-test was positively correlated with physical activity, but there was no effect of vitamin D supplementation looking at the two randomized groups. However, controlling for body mass index (BMI), the results showed an effect of BMI and a main effect of groups with a higher level of physical activity in the Intervention group. No interaction effects were found. Participants were also assigned into High and Low vitamin D groups based on the vitamin D status at post-test; i.e., the upper (75.1 nmol/L) and lower quartile (46.7 nmol/L). T-tests revealed that participants with a vitamin D status above 75 nmol/L showed significantly higher levels of physical activity than participants with a vitamin D status below 46.7 nmol/L. Thus, a vitamin D status above 75 nmol/L seems to be an optimal level.",research

Abstract: High-dose vitamin D supplementation can increase total osteocalcin concentrations that may reduce insulin resistance in individuals at risk for prediabetes or diabetes mellitus. Magnesium is a cofactor in vitamin D metabolism and activation. The purpose of this study was to determine the combined effect of vitamin D and magnesium supplementation on total osteocalcin concentrations, glycemic indices, and other bone turnover markers after a 12-week intervention in individuals who were overweight and obese, but otherwise healthy. We hypothesized that combined supplementation would improve serum total osteocalcin concentrations and glycemic indices more than vitamin D supplementation alone or a placebo.

Abstract: Objective: Treatment options in Graves' disease (GD) are limited and do not target the underlying autoimmunity, and relapse rates following a course of antithyroid drug (ATD) reach 50%. Previous research has shown promising results for a role of vitamin D in GD. We aimed to investigate whether vitamin D reduces failure to enter and sustain remission in patients with GD treated with ATD. Design: A multicenter, double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial comparing vitamin D 70 mcg once daily (2800 IU) or placebo. The intervention was given first as add-on to ATD treatment, maximally 24 months, and then for 12 months after ATD cessation. Inclusion period was from 2015 to 2017 and study completion by December 2020. Patients included were adults with a first-time diagnosis of GD treated with ATD. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy and glucocorticoid treatment. The primary endpoint was failure to enter and sustain remission defined as relapse of hyperthyroidism within 12 months after ATD cessation, inability to stop ATD within 24 months, or radioiodine treatment or thyroidectomy. Two hundred seventy-eight patients were included in the study, and 4 patients withdrew consent. No adverse effects were found. Results: Participants were aged 44 ± 14 years at enrollment and 79% were female. The risk of failure to enter and sustain remission was 42% [95% confidence interval (CI) 33-50%] in the vitamin D group and 32% [CI 24-40%] in the placebo group corresponding to a relative risk of 1.30 [CI 0.95-1.78]. Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation did not improve the treatment of GD in patients with normal or insufficient vitamin D status. Thus, supplementation with high-dose vitamin D cannot be recommended for GD. Study registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02384668.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Prior work suggests that patients with vitamin D insufficiency may have a higher risk of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) from paclitaxel. The objective of this study was to validate vitamin D insufficiency as a CIPN risk factor. METHODS: We used data and samples from the prospective phase III SWOG S0221 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00070564) trial that compared paclitaxel-containing chemotherapy regimens for early-stage breast cancer. We quantified pretreatment 25-hydroxy-vitamin D in banked serum samples using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry targeted assay. We tested the association between vitamin D insufficiency (≤20 ng/mL) and grade ≥3 sensory CIPN via multiple logistic regression and then adjusted for self-reported race, age, body mass index, and paclitaxel schedule (randomization to weekly or every-2-week dosing). We also tested the direct effect of vitamin D deficiency on mechanical hypersensitivity in mice randomized to a regular or vitamin D-deficient diet. RESULTS: Of the 1,191 female patients in the analysis, 397 (33.3%) had pretreatment vitamin D insufficiency, and 195 (16.4%) developed grade ≥3 CIPN. Patients with vitamin D insufficiency had a higher incidence of grade ≥3 CIPN than those who had sufficient vitamin D (20.7% vs 14.2%; odds ratio [OR], 1.57; 95% CI, 1.14-2.15; P=.005). The association retained significance after adjusting for age and paclitaxel schedule (adjusted OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.18-2.30; P=.003) but not race (adjusted OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.98-1.97; P=.066).

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate vitamin D status and effects of vitamin D intervention on bone mineral density (BMD) and content (BMC) in children with fair and dark skin in Sweden during winter. METHODS: In a 2-center prospective double-blinded randomized intervention study 5- to 7-year-old children (n = 206) with fair and dark skin in Sweden (55°N-63°N) received daily vitamin D supplements of 25 μg, 10 μg, or placebo (2 μg) during 3 winter months. We measured BMD and BMC for total body (TB), total body less head (TBLH), femoral neck (FN), and spine at baseline and 4 months later. Intake of vitamin D and calcium, serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (S-25[OH]D), and related parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: Despite lower S-25(OH)D in dark than fair-skinned children, BMD of TB (P = 0.012) and TBLH (P = 0.002) and BMC of TBLH (P = 0.04) were higher at baseline and follow-up in those with dark skin. Delta (Δ) BMD and BMC of TB and TBLH did not differ between intervention and placebo groups, but FN-BMC increased more among dark-skinned children in the 25 μg (P = 0.038) and 10 μg (P = 0.027) groups compared to placebo. We found no associations between Δ S-25(OH)D, P-parathyroid hormone, P-alkaline phosphatase, and Δ BMD and BMC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: BMD and BMC remained higher in dark- than fair-skinned children despite lower vitamin D status. Even though no difference in general was found in BMD or BMC after vitamin D intervention, the increase in FN-BMC in dark-skinned children may suggest an influence on bone in those with initially insufficient vitamin D status.",research

Abstract: In the past 50 y, there has been a decline in average sleep duration and quality, with adverse consequences on general health. A representative survey of 1,508 American adults recently revealed that 90% of Americans used some type of electronics at least a few nights per week within 1 h before bedtime. Mounting evidence from countries around the world shows the negative impact of such technology use on sleep. This negative impact on sleep may be due to the short-wavelength-enriched light emitted by these electronic devices, given that artificial-light exposure has been shown experimentally to produce alerting effects, suppress melatonin, and phase-shift the biological clock. A few reports have shown that these devices suppress melatonin levels, but little is known about the effects on circadian phase or the following sleep episode, exposing a substantial gap in our knowledge of how this increasingly popular technology affects sleep. Here we compare the biological effects of reading an electronic book on a light-emitting device (LE-eBook) with reading a printed book in the hours before bedtime. Participants reading an LE-eBook took longer to fall asleep and had reduced evening sleepiness, reduced melatonin secretion, later timing of their circadian clock, and reduced next-morning alertness than when reading a printed book. These results demonstrate that evening exposure to an LE-eBook phase-delays the circadian clock, acutely suppresses melatonin, and has important implications for understanding the impact of such technologies on sleep, performance, health, and safety.",research

Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation have been identified as potentially responsible for the development of endothelial damage and vascular stiffness, two of the primum movens of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Based on these data, we conducted an open-label randomized study, first, to evaluate the endothelial damage and vascular stiffness in hypertense patients; second, to test the effect of supplementation with a physiological antioxidant (melatonin 1 mg/day for 1 year) in patients with essential hypertension vs. hypertensive controls. Twenty-three patients of either gender were enrolled and randomized 1:1 in two groups (control and supplemented group). The plasmatic total antioxidant capacity (as a marker of oxidative stress), blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and peripheral endothelial function were evaluated at the beginning of the study and after 1 year in both groups.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of exogenous melatonin supplementation for sleep disturbances in patients with middle-aged primary insomnia. METHODS: This is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel study. Participants were recruited from Tianlin community, Xuhui district, Shanghai. Ninety-seven consecutive middle-aged patients with primary insomnia were randomized to receive 3 mg fast-release melatonin (n = 51) or placebo (n = 46) for four-weeks. Objective sleep parameters tested by overnight polysomnography, subjective sleep performance and daytime somnolence obtained from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were obtained at baseline and after treatment. Treatment was taken daily 1 h before bedtime. Serious adverse events and side-effects were monitored. RESULTS: Melatonin supplementation significantly decreased early wake time [-30.63min (95% CI, -53.92 to -7.34); P = 0.001] and percentage of N2 sleep [-7.07% (95% CI, -13.47% to -0.68%); P = 0.031]. However, melatonin had no significant effect on other objective sleep parameters including sleep latency, sleep efficiency, wake during the sleep and percent of N1, N3 and REM sleep. Melatonin had no effect on insomnia symptoms and severity on the PSQI [1.53(95% CI, -0.55 to 3.61); p = 0.504]; ISI [0.81 (95% CI, -2.27 to 3.88); p = 0.165] and ESS [-0.83 (95% CI, -3.53 to 1.88); p = 0.147].

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether the use of exogenous melatonin affects sleep, reduces the prevalence of delirium, and decreases the need for analgosedation and to assess whether serum melatonin indices correlate with exogenous administration in critically ill patients. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Multicenter ICUs of two tertiary hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 203 adult patients who were admitted to the ICU and administered with analgesics and/or sedatives. INTERVENTIONS: Oral melatonin (10 mg) or placebo for up to seven consecutive nights. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The number of observed sleeping hours at night was assessed by the bedside nurse. Sleep quality was evaluated using the Richards Campbell Questionnaire Sleep (RCSQ). The prevalence of delirium, pain, anxiety, adverse reactions, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU and hospital stays, and doses of sedative and analgesic drugs administered were recorded.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To determine the dose of melatonin with an optimal pharmacokinetic profile and to test whether this dose reduces the prevalence of delirium in mechanically ventilated ICU patients as compared to placebo. METHODS: DEMEL, a multicenter adaptive phase 2b/3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial included patients at 20 health centers in France from February 1st, 2019 through January 5th, 2021. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive either placebo or low (0.3 mg) or high (3 mg) dose melatonin enterally at 9:00 p.m. for 14 consecutive nights or until death or ICU discharge, whichever came first. The interim primary endpoint (activity stage) was the percentage of patients who achieved an optimal melatonin pharmacokinetic profile 24 h after starting study treatment; the final primary endpoint (efficacy phase) was the percentage of patients who experienced delirium between randomization and day 14 (or until death or ICU discharge, whichever came first). Delirium was assessed twice daily using the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU. RESULTS: We randomized 355 patients and included 334 in the primary analysis. At the preplanned analysis of the activity stage performed in 75 patients, the low-dose melatonin group had the highest rate of optimal pharmacokinetic profiles (12/24, 50%) when compared with the high-dose melatonin group (6/25, 24%) and the placebo group (0/26). Therefore, the Steering Committee recommended that the high-dose melatonin group be discontinued and that the low-dose melatonin group be selected to continue in the efficacy phase along with the placebo group.",research

METHOD: A total of 125 children and adolescents (2-17.5 years of age; 96.8% ASD, 3.2% Smith-Magenis syndrome [SMS]) whose sleep failed to improve on behavioral intervention alone were randomized (1:1 ratio), double-blind, to receive PedPRM (2 mg escalated to 5 mg) or placebo for 13 weeks. Sleep measures included the validated caregivers' Sleep and Nap Diary (SND) and Composite Sleep Disturbance Index (CSDI). The a priori primary endpoint was SND-reported total sleep time (TST) after 13 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: The study met the primary endpoint: after 13 weeks of double-blind treatment, participants slept on average 57.5 minutes longer at night with PedPRM compared to 9.14 minutes with placebo (adjusted mean treatment difference PedPRM-placebo -32.43 minutes; p = .034). Sleep latency (SL) decreased by 39.6 minutes on average with PedPRM and 12.5 minutes with placebo (adjusted mean treatment difference -25.30 minutes; p = .011) without causing earlier wakeup time. The rate of participants attaining clinically meaningful responses in TST and/or SL was significantly higher with PedPRM than with placebo (68.9% versus 39.3% respectively; p = .001) corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 3.38.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Delirium is common in the critically ill, highly distressing to patients and families and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Results of studies on preventative use of melatonin in various patient groups have produced mixed results. The aim of this study was to determine whether administration of melatonin decreases the prevalence of delirium in critically ill patients. METHODS: Multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial across 12 Australian ICUs recruiting patients from July 2016 to September 2019. Patients of at least 18 years requiring ICU admission with an expected length of stay (LOS) greater than 72 h; enrolled within 48 h of ICU admission. Indistinguishable liquid melatonin (4 mg; n = 419) or placebo (n = 422) was administered enterally at 21:00 h for 14 consecutive nights or until ICU discharge. The primary outcome was the proportion of delirium-free assessments, as a marker of delirium prevalence, within 14 days or before ICU discharge. Delirium was assessed twice daily using the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM-ICU) score. Secondary outcomes included sleep quality and quantity, hospital and ICU LOS, and hospital and 90-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 847 patients were randomized into the study with 841 included in data analysis. Baseline characteristics of the participants were similar. There was no significant difference in the average proportion of delirium-free assessments per patient between the melatonin and placebo groups (79.2 vs 80% respectively, p = 0.547).",research

Abstract: Smartphones deliver light to users through Light Emitting Diode (LED) displays. Blue light is the most potent wavelength for sleep and mood. This study investigated the immediate effects of smartphone blue light LED on humans at night. We investigated changes in serum melatonin levels, cortisol levels, body temperature, and psychiatric measures with a randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled design of two 3-day admissions. Each subject played smartphone games with either conventional LED or suppressed blue light from 7:30 to 10:00PM (150 min). Then, they were readmitted and conducted the same procedure with the other type of smartphone. Serum melatonin levels were measured in 60-min intervals before, during and after use of the smartphones. Serum cortisol levels and body temperature were monitored every 120 min. The Profile of Mood States (POMS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and auditory and visual Continuous Performance Tests (CPTs) were administered. Among the 22 participants who were each admitted twice, use of blue light smartphones was associated with significantly decreased sleepiness (Cohen's d = 0.49, Z = 43.50, p = 0.04) and confusion-bewilderment (Cohen's d = 0.53, Z = 39.00, p = 0.02), and increased commission error (Cohen's d = -0.59, t = -2.64, p = 0.02). Also, users of blue light smartphones experienced a longer time to reach dim light melatonin onset 50% (2.94 vs. 2.70 h) and had increases in body temperature, serum melatonin levels, and cortisol levels, although these changes were not statistically significant.",research

Published: Aug 2022

Abstract: Aging is associated with changes in sleep, and improving sleep may have important consequences for the health, cognition, and quality of life of older adults. Many prescription sleep aids increase the risk of nighttime falls, have adverse effects on next-day cognition, and are associated with increased mortality. Melatonin, a hormone secreted at night, increases sleep duration in young adults but only when administered during the day when endogenous levels are low. In a month-long cross-over study, we randomized 24 healthy older (age >55, mean 64.2 ± 6.3 years) participants to receive 2 weeks of placebo and 2 weeks of either a low (0.3 mg) or high (5.0 mg) dose of melatonin 30 min before lights out. Sleep was polysomnographically recorded and was scheduled during both the biological day and night using a forced desynchrony design. Although 0.3 mg melatonin had a trend towards increasing sleep efficiency (SE) overall, this was due to its effects on sleep during the biological day. In contrast, 5 mg melatonin significantly increased SE during both biological day and night, mainly by increasing the duration of Stage 2 non-rapid eye movement sleep and slightly shortening awakenings. Melatonin should be further explored as a sleep aid for older adults.",research

Abstract: Sleep disturbances are extremely common (40-86%) in children and adolescents, especially those with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and are often among the first symptoms identified by parents at a very early stage of their child's development. These abnormalities are among the main parental concerns when having a child with ASD and have a significant impact on the quality of life of patients, their parents, and more broadly their siblings. Sleep disorders are essentially abnormalities of the sleep-wake rhythm - primarily sleep onset insomnia or nocturnal awakenings (with difficulty falling back to sleep). These disturbances can be accompanied by other sleep disorders, requiring notably a systematic elimination of the presence of a sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome - to ensure a personalized and efficient therapeutic approach. Physiologically, the determinants of these sleep disorders are poorly understood, even though several studies point to a significant decrease in melatonin synthesis in people with ASD. Melatonin is a hormone that facilitates falling asleep and maintaining sleep and is also involved in the endogenous synchronization of internal biological clocks. However, the causal factors of this decrease in melatonin synthesis are largely unknown, involving to a small extent the genes involved in melatonin synthesis pathway. The treatment of sleep disorders is relatively systematic: after eliminating other specific sleep disorders associated with the complaint of insomnia, as well as other possible associated comorbidities (such as seizures), a global and graduated therapeutic approach must be put in place. This treatment will be non-pharmacological as a first line, then pharmacological as a second line.",research
pubmed_35120753_2,[Therapeutic approaches for sleep and rhythms disorders in children with ASD].,PubMed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35120753/,Public Domain,2026-01-26,"A number of non-pharmacological treatment strategies for sleep disorders in typically developing children and adolescents, as well as those with ASD, have been shown to be effective. This treatment requires a combination of: 1) parental education to promote sleep development; 2) setting up bedtime rituals adapted to the child's age and particularities; 3) specific behavioral strategies including bedtime fading, gradual extinction and positive reinforcement of adapted behaviors. It is very essential that the parents are accompanied throughout this therapy. Sleep hygiene and behavioral care must also take into consideration the important role of the zeitgebers of sleep-wake rhythms, i.e. the external environmental factors involved in the synchronization of the biological clocks: regular exposure to light at adapted times, regular meal and wake-up times, social activities and times for going to school. The evidence for the effectiveness of behavioral interventions in the treatment of behavioral insomnia in the typical developmental child is strong, since 94% of children show clinically significant improvements in nighttime sleepiness and waking. By contrast, only about 25% of children with ASD are improved by an approach combining sleep hygiene and behavioral therapy. Melatonin has a special and prominent place in the drug management of sleep disorders associated with ASD. Several clinical trials have shown that melatonin is effective in treating sleep disorders in patients with ASD. This work led to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granting marketing authorization in September 2018 for a sustained-release paediatric melatonin molecule (Slenyto®). This synthetic molecule is a prolonged release melatonin (PRM) which mimics the physiological pharmacokinetic and secretory characteristics of endogenous melatonin, having a very short blood half-life and prolonged secretion for several hours during the night.",research

Published: Sep 2015

Abstract: Caffeine's wakefulness-promoting and sleep-disrupting effects are well established, yet whether caffeine affects human circadian timing is unknown. We show that evening caffeine consumption delays the human circadian melatonin rhythm in vivo and that chronic application of caffeine lengthens the circadian period of molecular oscillations in vitro, primarily with an adenosine receptor/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-dependent mechanism. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, ~49-day long, within-subject study, we found that consumption of a caffeine dose equivalent to that in a double espresso 3 hours before habitual bedtime induced a ~40-min phase delay of the circadian melatonin rhythm in humans. This magnitude of delay was nearly half of the magnitude of the phase-delaying response induced by exposure to 3 hours of evening bright light (~3000 lux, ~7 W/m(2)) that began at habitual bedtime. Furthermore, using human osteosarcoma U2OS cells expressing clock gene luciferase reporters, we found a dose-dependent lengthening of the circadian period by caffeine. By pharmacological dissection and small interfering RNA knockdown, we established that perturbation of adenosine receptor signaling, but not ryanodine receptor or phosphodiesterase activity, was sufficient to account for caffeine's effects on cellular timekeeping. We also used a cyclic AMP biosensor to show that caffeine increased cyclic AMP levels, indicating that caffeine influenced a core component of the cellular circadian clock. Together, our findings demonstrate that caffeine influences human circadian timing, showing one way that the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug affects human physiology.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM)-associated hyperinflammatory host response significantly provokes periodontal tissue destruction. In this context, the support of nonsurgical periodontal therapy in diabetics with host modulation agents is a current field of study. This clinical study aims to investigate the clinical efficacy of melatonin supplementation and discuss its possible biological mechanisms in nonsurgical periodontal treatment in patients with DM and periodontitis through some fundamental markers. METHODS: In this randomized controlled and single-blind study, 27 of 55 diabetic patients with periodontitis (stage III/IV and grade C) underwent full-mouth scaling and root planing (fmSRP) alone and 28 patients underwent melatonin administration (6 mg daily, 30 days) in addition to fmSRP (full-mouth scaling and root planing plus melatonin, fmSRP-mel). The potential therapeutic contribution of melatonin was evaluated clinically and biochemically (gingival crevicular fluid RANKL, OPG, MMP-8, and serum IL-1β levels) at 3rd and 6th months. RESULTS: Melatonin (tablet, 6 mg daily, 30 days) did not cause any local or systemic side effects. fmSRP alone resulted in significant reduction in serum IL-1β levels, pocket depths, gingival inflammation, and gingival crevicular fluid RANKL and MMP-8 levels (p < 0.05). Moreover, melatonin supplementation resulted in a more significant decrease in bleeding and pocket depth scores at probing, especially at 3 months (p < 0.05). Furthermore, RANKL and MMP-8 levels were significantly lower at 3 months and IL-1β levels at 6 months compared to the control group (p < 0.05).

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Melatonin has been studied in headache disorders. Amitriptyline is efficacious for migraine prevention, but its unfavourable side effect profile limits its use. METHODS: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out. Men and women, aged 18-65 years, with migraine with or without aura, experiencing 2-8 attacks per month, were enrolled. After a 4-week baseline phase, 196 participants were randomised to placebo, amitriptyline 25 mg or melatonin 3 mg, and 178 took a study medication and were followed for 3 months (12 weeks). The primary outcome was the number of migraine headache days per month at baseline versus last month. Secondary end points were responder rate, migraine intensity, duration and analgesic use. Tolerability was also compared between groups. RESULTS: Mean headache frequency reduction was 2.7 migraine headache days in the melatonin group, 2.2 for amitriptyline and 1.1 for placebo. Melatonin significantly reduced headache frequency compared with placebo (p=0.009), but not to amitriptyline (p=0.19). Melatonin was superior to amitriptyline in the percentage of patients with a greater than 50% reduction in migraine frequency. Melatonin was better tolerated than amitriptyline. Weight loss was found in the melatonin group, a slight weight gain in placebo and significantly for amitriptyline users. CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin 3 mg is better than placebo for migraine prevention, more tolerable than amitriptyline and as effective as amitriptyline 25 mg.",research

Abstract: Because 80%-90% of our time is spent indoors and daylight is the main synchronizer of the central biological clock, the chronic lack of daylight is increasingly considered as a risk factor for metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes. In a randomized crossover design (NCT05263232), 13 individuals with type 2 diabetes were exposed to natural daylight facilitated through windows vs. constant artificial lighting during office hours for 4.5 consecutive days. Continuous glucose monitoring revealed that participants spent more time in the normal glucose range, and whole-body substrate metabolism shifted toward a greater reliance on fat oxidation during daylight. Primary myotubes cultured from skeletal muscle biopsies displayed a phase advance after daylight exposure. Multi-omic analyses revealed daylight-induced differences in serum metabolites, lipids, and monocyte transcripts. Our findings suggest that natural daylight exposure has a positive metabolic impact on individuals with type 2 diabetes and could support the treatment of metabolic diseases.",research

Abstract: Probiotics have been proposed to ameliorate cognitive impairment and depressive disorder via the gut-brain axis in patients and experimental animal models. However, the beneficial role of probiotics in brain functions of healthy older adults remains unclear. Therefore, a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled multicenter trial was conducted to determine the effects of probiotics on cognition and mood in community-dwelling older adults. Sixty-three healthy elders (≥65 years) consumed either placebo or probiotics containing Bifidobacterium bifidum BGN4 and Bifidobacterium longum BORI for 12 weeks. The gut microbiota was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatics. Brain functions were measured using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease, Satisfaction with life scale, stress questionnaire, Geriatric depression scale, and Positive affect and negative affect schedule. Blood brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Relative abundance of inflammation-causing gut bacteria was significantly reduced at Week 12 in the probiotics group (p < .05). The probiotics group showed greater improvement in mental flexibility test and stress score than the placebo group (p < .05). Contrary to placebo, probiotics significantly increased serum BDNF level (p < .05). Notably, the gut microbes significantly shifted by probiotics (Eubacterium and Clostridiales) showed significant negative correlation with serum BDNF level only in the probiotics group (RS = -0.37, RS = -0.39, p < .05).",research

Abstract: A promising new treatment approach for major depressive disorder (MDD) targets the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis, which is linked to physiological and behavioral functions affected in MDD. This is the first randomized controlled trial to determine whether short-term, high-dose probiotic supplementation reduces depressive symptoms along with gut microbial and neural changes in depressed patients. Patients with current depressive episodes took either a multi-strain probiotic supplement or placebo over 31 days additionally to treatment-as-usual. Assessments took place before, immediately after and again four weeks after the intervention. The Hamilton Depression Rating Sale (HAM-D) was assessed as primary outcome. Quantitative microbiome profiling and neuroimaging was used to detect changes along the MGB axis. In the sample that completed the intervention (probiotics N = 21, placebo N = 26), HAM-D scores decreased over time and interactions between time and group indicated a stronger decrease in the probiotics relative to the placebo group. Probiotics maintained microbial diversity and increased the abundance of the genus Lactobacillus, indicating the effectivity of the probiotics to increase specific taxa. The increase of the Lactobacillus was associated with decreased depressive symptoms in the probiotics group. Finally, putamen activation in response to neutral faces was significantly decreased after the probiotic intervention.",research

Abstract: Probiotics are widely prescribed for prevention of antibiotics-associated dysbiosis and related adverse effects. However, probiotic impact on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the gut mucosal host-microbiome niche remains elusive. We invasively examined the effects of multi-strain probiotics or autologous fecal microbiome transplantation (aFMT) on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the murine and human mucosal microbiome niche. Contrary to homeostasis, antibiotic perturbation enhanced probiotics colonization in the human mucosa but only mildly improved colonization in mice. Compared to spontaneous post-antibiotic recovery, probiotics induced a markedly delayed and persistently incomplete indigenous stool/mucosal microbiome reconstitution and host transcriptome recovery toward homeostatic configuration, while aFMT induced a rapid and near-complete recovery within days of administration. In vitro, Lactobacillus-secreted soluble factors contributed to probiotics-induced microbiome inhibition. Collectively, potential post-antibiotic probiotic benefits may be offset by a compromised gut mucosal recovery, highlighting a need of developing aFMT or personalized probiotic approaches achieving mucosal protection without compromising microbiome recolonization in the antibiotics-perturbed host.",research

Abstract: Human gut microbiome is a promising target for managing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Measures altering gut microbiota like oral intake of probiotics or berberine (BBR), a bacteriostatic agent, merit metabolic homoeostasis. We hence conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with newly diagnosed T2D patients from 20 centres in China. Four-hundred-nine eligible participants were enroled, randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) and completed a 12-week treatment of either BBR-alone, probiotics+BBR, probiotics-alone, or placebo, after a one-week run-in of gentamycin pretreatment.

BBR treatment induced more gastrointestinal side effects.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide; with evidence suggesting that decreased gut barrier function and inflammation are correlated with depressive symptoms. We conducted a clinical trial to determine the effect of consumption of probiotic supplements (Winclove's Ecologic® Barrier) on depressive symptoms in a sample of participants with mild to severe depression. METHOD: 71 participants were randomly allocated to either probiotic or placebo, which was, consumed daily over eight weeks. Pre- and post-intervention measures of symptoms and vulnerability markers of depression as well as gut microbiota composition were compared. Clinical trial participants were also compared on psychological variables and gut microbiota composition to a non-depressed group (n = 20). RESULTS: All clinical trial participants demonstrated improvement in symptoms, suggesting non-specific therapeutic effects associated with weekly monitoring visits. Participants in the probiotic group demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in cognitive reactivity compared with the placebo group, particularly in the mild/moderate subgroup. Probiotics did not significantly alter the microbiota of depressed individuals, however, a significant correlation was found between Ruminococcus gnavus and one depression metric. LIMITATIONS: There was a high attrition rate, which may be attributed to weekly monitoring visits. Additionally, modulation of the gut microbiota may need more specific testing to distinguish subtle changes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have established that probiotics or prebiotics can relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (AR), but their mechanism of action remain underexplored. This study aimed to observe the clinical efficacy of probiotics combined with prebiotics in seasonal AR patients and explore their underlying mechanisms. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Outcome measures included total nasal symptom score (TNSS), visual analog scale, rhinitis quality of life questionnaire, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and the rate and intensity of Loratadine use. Serum TNF-α, INF-γ, IL-4, IL-17, and IgE levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Intestinal microbiota was detected by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR. Short-chain fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: 106 participants (N = 53 for both test group and placebo group) completed the study.

Abstract: The current study aims to evaluate the potential roles of taking probiotics postoperatively in attenuating the gastrointestinal complications and disturbed gut microbiota in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients undergoing chemotherapy. One hundred eligible CRC patients who were treated with radical surgery and needed to receive chemotherapy were recruited. Half of them were randomly assigned to the Probio group to take a probiotic combination from post-operation to the end of the first chemotherapeutic course. The other half of patients taking placebo instead were classified as the Placebo group. Gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, acid reflux, abdominal pain, abdominal distention, constipation, and diarrhea were recorded during chemotherapy. Fecal samples were collected preoperatively and after the first cycle of postoperative chemotherapy for 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) analysis. Results showed that probiotics administration could effectively reduce chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal complications, particularly in diarrhea (p < 0.01). Additionally, chemotherapy also reduced the bacterial diversity indexes of the gut microbiota in CRC patients, which could be significantly increased by taking probiotics. Moreover, this chemotherapy caused significant changes in the composition of the gut microbiota, as indicated by decreased phylum levels of Firmicutes and increased Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. In particular, several bacterial genera such as Akkermansia and Clostridium were significantly increased, while Prevotella, Lactobacillus, and Roseburia were decreased (p < 0.05).",research

Abstract: The prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is increasing, but its etiology remains elusive and hence an effective treatment is not available. Previous research conducted on animal models suggests that microbiota-gut-brain axis may contribute to ASD pathology and more human research is needed. This study was divided into two stages,.At the discovery stage, we compared the differences in gut microbiota profiles (using 16S rRNA sequencing), fecal SCFAs (using GC-MS) and plasma neurotransmitters (using UHPLC-MS/MS) of 26 children with ASD and 24 normal children. All 26 children with ASD participated in the intervention stage, and we measured the gut microbiota profiles, SCFAs and neurotransmitters before and after probiotics + FOS (n = 16) or placebo supplementation (n = 10). We found that gut microbiota was in a state of dysbiosis and significantly lower levels of Bifidobacteriales and Bifidobacterium longum were observed at the discovery stage in children with ASD. An increase in beneficial bacteria (Bifidobacteriales and B. longum) and suppression of suspected pathogenic bacteria (Clostridium) emerged after probiotics + FOS intervention, with significant reduction in the severity of autism and gastrointestinal symptoms.

Abstract: Empiric probiotics are commonly consumed by healthy individuals as means of life quality improvement and disease prevention. However, evidence of probiotic gut mucosal colonization efficacy remains sparse and controversial. We metagenomically characterized the murine and human mucosal-associated gastrointestinal microbiome and found it to only partially correlate with stool microbiome. A sequential invasive multi-omics measurement at baseline and during consumption of an 11-strain probiotic combination or placebo demonstrated that probiotics remain viable upon gastrointestinal passage. In colonized, but not germ-free mice, probiotics encountered a marked mucosal colonization resistance. In contrast, humans featured person-, region- and strain-specific mucosal colonization patterns, hallmarked by predictive baseline host and microbiome features, but indistinguishable by probiotics presence in stool. Consequently, probiotics induced a transient, individualized impact on mucosal community structure and gut transcriptome. Collectively, empiric probiotics supplementation may be limited in universally and persistently impacting the gut mucosa, meriting development of new personalized probiotic approaches.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: A high prevalence of a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms is frequently reported in patients with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The GI disturbances in ASD might be linked to gut dysbiosis representing the observable phenotype of a ""gut-brain axis"" disruption. The exploitation of strategies which can restore normal gut microbiota and reduce the gut production and absorption of toxins, such as probiotics addition/supplementation in a diet, may represent a non-pharmacological option in the treatment of GI disturbances in ASD. The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the effects of supplementation with a probiotic mixture (Vivomixx®) in ASD children not only on specific GI symptoms, but also on the core deficits of the disorder, on cognitive and language development, and on brain function and connectivity. An ancillary aim is to evaluate possible effects of probiotic supplementation on urinary concentrations of phthalates (chemical pollutants) which have been previously linked to ASD. METHODS: A group of 100 preschoolers with ASD will be classified as belonging to a GI group or to a Non-GI (NGI) group on the basis of a symptom severity index specific to GI disorders. In order to obtain four arms, subjects belonging to the two groups (GI and NGI) will be blind randomized 1:1 to regular diet with probiotics or with placebo for 6 months.",research

DISCUSSION: The effects of treatments with probiotics on children with ASD need to be evaluated through rigorous controlled trials. Examining the impact of probiotics not only on clinical but also on neurophysiological patterns, the current trial sets out to provide new insights into the gut-brain connection in ASD patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Widespread antibiotic resistance has sparked interest in the identification of nonantibiotic strategies, particularly probiotics for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). We evaluated the effectiveness of prophylactic probiotic supplementation through oral and intravaginal routes in the prevention of recurrent UTIs. METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 174 premenopausal women with a history of recurrent UTIs and randomized them to 1 of the 4 treatment groups: placebo (G1, oral placebo + vaginal placebo), oral probiotic (G2, oral lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria + vaginal placebo), vaginal probiotic (G3, oral placebo + vaginal lactobacilli), and probiotic combination (oral lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria + vaginal lactobacilli), for 4 months. Participants were followed up for symptomatic UTIs for 1 year. The primary end points were the number of symptomatic UTIs at 4 months, the proportion of participants with at least 1 symptomatic UTI, and the time to the first symptomatic UTI. RESULTS: The incidence of UTI at 4 months in G1, G2, G3, and G4 was 70.4%, 61.3%, 40.9%, and 31.8%, respectively. The mean number of symptomatic UTI recurrences at 4 months was significantly lower (P < .05) in G3 (1.06) and G4 (1.07) compared with G1 (2.1) and G2 (1.63). Further, the time to first symptomatic UTI (days) was significantly longer (P < .05) in G3 (123.8) and G4 (141.8) compared with G1 (69.3) and G2 (71.9).

Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Growing interest in microbial dysbiosis during critical illness has raised questions about the therapeutic potential of microbiome modification with probiotics. Prior randomized trials in this population suggest that probiotics reduce infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), although probiotic-associated infections have also been reported. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG on preventing VAP, additional infections, and other clinically important outcomes in the intensive care unit (ICU). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized placebo-controlled trial in 44 ICUs in Canada, the United States, and Saudi Arabia enrolling adults predicted to require mechanical ventilation for at least 72 hours. A total of 2653 patients were enrolled from October 2013 to March 2019 (final follow-up, October 2020). INTERVENTIONS: Enteral L rhamnosus GG (1 × 1010 colony-forming units) (n = 1321) or placebo (n = 1332) twice daily in the ICU. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was VAP determined by duplicate blinded central adjudication. Secondary outcomes were other ICU-acquired infections including Clostridioides difficile infection, diarrhea, antimicrobial use, ICU and hospital length of stay, and mortality. RESULTS: Among 2653 randomized patients (mean age, 59.8 years [SD], 16.5 years), 2650 (99.9%) completed the trial (mean age, 59.8 years [SD], 16.5 years; 1063 women [40.1%.] with a mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 22.0 (SD, 7.8) and received the study product for a median of 9 days (IQR, 5-15 days).",research

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The management of obesity is difficult with many failures of lifestyle measures, hence the need to broaden the range of treatments prescribed. The aim of our work was to study the influence of pre and probiotics on weight loss psychological profile and metabolic parameters in obese patients. METHODS: It is a clinical trial involving 45 obese patients, recruited from the Obesity Unit of the National Institute of Nutrition between March and August 2022 divided into three groups: diet only (low-carbohydrate and reduced energy diet), prebiotics (30 g of carob/day) and probiotics (one tablet containing Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus/day). The three groups were matched for age, sex and BMI. Patients were seen after 1 month from the intervention. Anthropometric measures, biological parameters, dietary survey and psychological scores were performed. RESULTS: The average age of our population was 48.73 ± 7.7 years, with a female predominance. All three groups showed a significant decrease in weight, BMI and waist circumference with p < .05. Only the prebiotic and probiotic group showed a significant decrease in fat mass (p = .001) and a significant increase in muscle strength with p = .008 and .004, but the differences were not significant between the three groups. Our results showed also a significant decrease in insulinemia and HOMA-IR in the prebiotic group compared to the diet-alone group (p = .03; p = .012) and the probiotic group showed a significant decrease in fasting blood glucose compared to the diet alone group (p = .02).",research

Abstract: Food-drug interactions should be suspected when a patient is taking their medications as directed and doses are optimized yet therapy is still not optimal (increased adverse effects, decreased efficacy, new adverse effects, etc). In all individuals with suspected food-drug interactions, diet history, baseline laboratory values, drug concentrations, and prescription history are recommended to assess the patient for a possible food-drug interaction. The 3 types of food-drug interactions are pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic. Pharmaceutical interactions occur with delivery devices or enteral feeding products. Pharmacokinetic interactions include the processes of a drug's release, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and/or elimination, ultimately affecting the effectiveness and safety of therapy. Pharmacodynamic interactions occur when food alters a drug's clinical effect on the body. The most common food-drug interactions exist with fruits (especially grapefruit), dairy, vitamin K, tyramine-containing foods, and alcohol. Patient counseling and collaboration between health-care teams can help patients avoid food-drug interactions. As a result, medication therapy can be optimized and adverse effects can be avoided.",research

Published: Jul 2017

Abstract: Nearly 25% of U.S. adults report concurrently taking a prescription medication with a dietary supplement. Some supplements, such as St. John's wort and goldenseal, are known to cause clinically important drug interactions and should be avoided by most patients receiving any pharmacologic therapy. However, many other supplements are predicted to cause interactions based only on in vitro studies that have not been confirmed or have been refuted in human clinical trials. Some supplements may cause interactions with a few medications but are likely to be safe with other medications (e.g., curcumin, echinacea, garlic, Asian ginseng, green tea extract, kava kava). Some supplements have a low likelihood of drug interactions and, with certain caveats, can safely be taken with most medications (e.g., black cohosh, cranberry, ginkgo, milk thistle, American ginseng, saw palmetto, valerian). Clinicians should consult reliable dietary supplement resources, or clinical pharmacists or pharmacologists, to help assess the safety of specific herbal supplement-drug combinations. Because most patients do not disclose supplement use to clinicians, the most important strategy for detecting herb-drug interactions is to develop a trusting relationship that encourages patients to discuss their dietary supplement use.",research

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hypertension is remarkably prevalent, affecting an estimated 1.13 billion people worldwide. It often requires the use of multi-drug regimens and is commonly associated with a myriad of other comorbidities which increase medication use. The pervasive use of antihypertensive medications combined with the presence of polypharmacy in many hypertensive patients results in significant risk of drug interactions. This review will summarize the relevant literature to assist clinicians in mitigating drug interaction risks when prescribing antihypertensives. RECENT FINDINGS: Pharmacokinetic interactions affect drug disposition in the body and can occur at the steps of absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination of involved medications. Data has established the calcium channel blockers, namely, diltiazem and verapamil, as potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, and the majority of significant drug interactions involving antihypertensives are attributable to these two agents. Although less common, pharmacokinetic drug interactions with other antihypertensive classes have also been identified. Pharmacodynamic drug interactions with antihypertensives lead to synergy or antagonism of blood pressure lowering effects and can increase or mitigate adverse effects depending on the agents involved. Knowledge is emerging about drug-induced phenoconversion, a phenomenon whereby a drug interaction results in a drug metabolizing phenotype that is different than that predicted by an individual's genotype. Antihypertensive use in patients with comorbidities and polypharmacy increases the likelihood of encountering important drug-drug interactions. Dedicated efforts to better understand the relationship between pharmacokinetic drug interactions and pharmacogenomic information is important to advance efforts related to personalized medicine.",research

Abstract: Introduction: MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), a synthetic ring-substituted amphetamine, has become one of the most widely used recreational psychostimulant drugs in the world. Among recreational ecstasy/MDMA users, polydrug use is a phenomenon whose common purpose is to experience the synergistic effect of the combined drugs, moderate MDMA effects, prevent potential toxicity, enhance a high or come down from a high from other drugs, or simply to treat existing medical conditions. Thus, MDMA-drug interactions (MDMA-DIs) lead to a higher risk of acute and life-threatening MDMA toxicity.Areas covered: This article provides an overview of the MDMA-DIs with pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse. In addition, available evidence is summarized along with clinical recommendations. Finally, the increasing importance of MDMA-DIs is highlighted.Expert opinion: There is a reduced number of published MDMA-DIs studies and scarce clinically significant MDMA-DIs documented in the literature. Experimental evidence points out the relevance of MDMA-DI's when MDMA is co-administered with pharmaceuticals that are metabolized by the CYP2D6 due to MDMA inhibitory action and in the case of repeated MDMA administration (MDMA-MDMAIs).",research

Abstract: Food effect, also known as food-drug interactions, is a common phenomenon associated with orally administered medications and can be defined as changes in absorption rate or absorption extent. The mechanisms of food effect and their consequences can involve multiple factors, including human post-prandial physiology, properties of the drug, and how the drug is administered. Therefore, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of these mechanisms when recommending whether a specific drug should be taken with or without food. Food-drug interactions can be clinically relevant, especially when they must be avoided to prevent undesirable effects or exploited to optimize medication therapy. This review conducts a literature search that examined studies on food effect. We summarized the literature and identified and discussed common food effect mechanisms. Furthermore, we highlighted drugs that have a clinically significant food effect and discussed the corresponding mechanisms. In addition, this review analyzes the effects of high-fat food or standard meals on the oral drug absorption rate and absorption extent for 229 drugs based on the Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System and demonstrates an association between Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System class and food effect.",research

Abstract: Modeling and simulation of drug disposition has emerged as an important tool in drug development, clinical study design and regulatory review, and the number of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling related publications and regulatory submissions have risen dramatically in recent years. However, the extent of use of PBPK modeling by researchers, and the public availability of models has not been systematically evaluated. This review evaluates PBPK-related publications to 1) identify the common applications of PBPK modeling; 2) determine ways in which models are developed; 3) establish how model quality is assessed; and 4) provide a list of publically available PBPK models for sensitive P450 and transporter substrates as well as selective inhibitors and inducers.

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) occur when one drug adds to or diminishes the effect of another drug (ie, pharmacodynamic interaction) or affects the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of another drug (ie, pharmacokinetic interaction). Such interactions cause 26% of all adverse drug events (ADEs) and are associated with a significant burden on the health care system through increased hospitalizations. Some of the most common DDIs result from alterations in drug metabolism through interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes and absorption through interactions with P-glycoproteins. Other common DDIs occur because of additive effects, including combinations of drugs that increase the risk of seizures, prolong the QT interval, increase central nervous system depression, and increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. Drug-related clinical decision support has been shown to improve the quality of patient care and decrease ADE rates. However, alerts generated by such systems should be interpreted using clinical judgment to determine the risks and benefits of certain drugs on a patient-specific basis. Family physicians can prevent clinically significant DDIs and optimize drug safety by using drug interaction software, along with a general understanding of common DDI mechanisms and collaboration with pharmacists.",research

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Provide an up-to-date review for health care providers regarding clinically significant food-drug interactions and summarize recommendations for optimal medication administration in older adults and long-term care patients. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, PUBMED, and IPA abstracts to locate relevant articles published between January 1982 and July 2017. DAILYMED was used to identify manufacturer-specific medication administration recommendations. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were reviewed for inclusion based on their relevance to this subject matter and the integrity of the information provided. Additionally, the package labeling of included products was reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: The current recommendations for specific medication administration with regard to food are summarized descriptively. CONCLUSION: Clinically significant food-drug interactions are common and have been reported with multiple classes of medications. However, there are a limited number of studies examining food-drug interactions, and the majority of recommendations are made by product-specific manufacturers. Pharmacists should be aware of common food-drug interactions in the community, assisted living, long-term care, subacute care, and hospital settings. To optimize medication therapy and improve therapeutic outcomes, it is important for pharmacists and other health care providers to identify agents with potential for food-drug interactions and to understand the clinical relevance of such interactions.",research

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are common and avoidable complications that are associated with poor patient outcomes. Neurocritical care patients may be at particular risk for DDIs due to alterations in pharmacokinetic profiles and exposure to medications with a high DDI risk. This review describes the principles of DDI pharmacology, common and severe DDIs in Neurocritical care, and recommendations to minimize adverse outcomes. A review of published literature was performed using PubMed by searching for 'Drug Interaction' and several high DDI risk and common neurocritical care medications. Key medication classes included anticoagulants, antimicrobials, antiepileptics, antihypertensives, sedatives, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Additional literature was also reviewed to determine the risk in neurocritical care and potential therapeutic alternatives. Clinicians should be aware of interactions in this setting, the long-term complications, and therapeutic alternatives.",research

Abstract: Natural products have been used by humans since antiquity for both egregious and beneficial purposes. Regarding the latter, these products have long been valued as a rich source of phytochemicals and developed into numerous life-saving pharmaceutical agents. Today, the sales and use of natural products with purported medicinal qualities continue to increase worldwide. However, natural products are not subject to the same premarket testing requirements as pharmaceutical agents, creating critical gaps in scientific knowledge about their optimal use. In addition, due to the common misperception that ""natural"" means ""safe,"" patients may supplement or replace their prescription medications with natural products, placing themselves at undue risk for subefficacious pharmacotherapy or potentially toxic exposure. Collectively, with few exceptions, researchers, health care providers, and educators lack definitive information about how to inform consumers, patients, and students in the health professions on the safe and optimal use of these products. Recognition of this deficiency by key stakeholders, including the three pillars of biomedical research-industry, academia, and government-has facilitated multiple collaborations that are actively addressing this fundamental knowledge gap. This special issue contains a collection of articles highlighting the challenges faced by researchers in the field and the use of various experimental systems and methods to improve the mechanistic understanding of the disposition and drug interaction potential of natural products. Continued refinement of existing, and development of new, approaches will progress toward the common overarching goal of improving public health.",research

Abstract: In India, traditional herbal medicines have been an essential part of therapy for the last centuries. However, a large portion of the general populace is using these therapies in combination with allopathy lacking a proper understanding of possible interactions (synergistic or antagonistic) between the herbal product and the allopathic drug. This is based on the assumption that herbal drugs are relatively safe, i.e. without side effects. We have established a comprehensive understanding of the possible herb-drug interactions and identified interaction patterns between the most common herbs and drugs currently in use in the Indian market. For this purpose, we listed common interactors (herbs and allopathic drugs) using available scientific literature. Drugs were then categorized into therapeutic classes and aligned to produce a recognizable pattern present only if interactions were observed between a drug class and herb in the scientific literature. Interestingly, the top three categories (with highest interactors), antibiotics, oral hypoglycemics, and anticonvulsants, displayed synergistic interactions only. Another major interactor category was CYP450 enzymes, a natural component of our metabolism. Both activation and inhibition of CYP450 enzymes were observed. As many allopathic drugs are known CYP substrates, inhibitors or inducers, ingestion of an interacting herb could result in interaction with the co-administered drug. This information is largely unavailable for the Indian population and should be studied in greater detail to avoid such interactions. Although this information is not absolute, the systematic literature review proves the existence of herb-drug interactions in the literature and studies where no interaction was detected are equally important.",research

Published: Dec 2019

Abstract: Cola-containing drinks (CCDs) are among the most common drinks in the world. There are some reports on interactions between CCDs and some drugs. However, there is no review on reported and possible interactions of CCDs. Thus, this paper attempted to provide a comprehensive review on this subject. It is well-accepted that CCDs are acidic and contain caffeine. It has been suggested that these two properties potentiate interactions of CCDs with different drugs in the context of both pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic, which includes drug absorption, metabolism, and renal excretion of drugs. It has been shown that serum concentrations of MTX, clozapine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and ibuprofen increased following CCD consumption; these interactions can be toxic. Additionally, it has been reported that serum levels of lithium and warfarin were decreased and their efficacy reduced when simultaneously administered with CCDs. Serum concentrations of erlotinib and different azoles, including itraconazol, posaconazole, and ketoconazole, have been shown to increase when these drugs were co-administered with a CCD. As proposed and discussed here, CCDs have the potential for interactions with numerous other drugs and thus clinicians should be aware of reported and potential interactions of CCDs with various medications in order to avoid adverse reactions and achieve expected clinical response.",research

Abstract: The most common applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in drug treatment have to do with matching patients to their optimal drug or combination of drugs, predicting drug-target or drug-drug interactions, and optimizing treatment protocols. This review outlines some of the recently developed AI methods aiding the drug treatment and administration process. Selection of the best drug(s) for a patient typically requires the integration of patient data, such as genetics or proteomics, with drug data, like compound chemical descriptors, to score the therapeutic efficacy of drugs. The prediction of drug interactions often relies on similarity metrics, assuming that drugs with similar structures or targets will have comparable behavior or may interfere with each other. Optimizing the dosage schedule for administration of drugs is performed using mathematical models to interpret pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data. The recently developed and powerful models for each of these tasks are addressed, explained, and analyzed here.",research

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Medications have the potential to affect nutritional status in negative ways, especially as the number of medications increase. The inter-relation between polypharmacy and malnutrition is complex and not fully delineated in previous studies. More research has been done and compiled in the last year, which helps to clarify this relationship. This review brings together the most recent literature with the previous research to help healthcare providers to better assess and manage medication therapy in older adults. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent evidence confirms a synergistic negative effect of polypharmacy and malnutrition on outcomes of older adults. In addition, several drug classes, including common antihypertensive agents, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, multivitamins, proton pump inhibitors, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), antiplatelet agents and metformin, have been implicated in important drug-nutrient interactions. These are reviewed in detail here. Ongoing research endeavors are described. SUMMARY: Healthcare practitioners can use this review to identify potentially inappropriate medications and patients at highest risk of experiencing a medication-related adverse reaction in order to systematically deprescribe these high-risk medications.",research

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate potentially inappropriate medications, potential drug-drug interactions, and prescribing practices in elderly ambulatory patients. METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional study on 275 elderly patients attending different outpatient departments. We used the Screening Tool for Older Person's Prescriptions criteria version two to identify potentially inappropriate medications, IBM Micromedex, to categorize potential drug-drug interactions as major and moderate. World Health Organization prescribing indicators were used to evaluate prescribing practices. RESULTS: The prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications in 275 prescriptions was 21.9%. Diclofenac was the most common inappropriate drug (n=23). Metoprolol is the second most inappropriate drug (n=12). Amlodipine and clopidogrel, aspirin and furosemide, and aspirin and spironolactone together accounted for 71.42% of major interactions (n=15). Atorvastatin and clopidogrel was the most common moderate drug-drug interaction in our study (n=24). The average number of drugs per encounter, the percentage of drugs with a generic name, and the percentage of drugs from the essential drugs list must be improved. CONCLUSION: There is a need to provide awareness through education about the explicit criteria to identify potentially inappropriate medications and prescribing indicators that aid in rational prescribing in the elderly.",research

Abstract: PURPOSE: Polypharmacy is prevalent in older adults starting cancer treatment and associated with potentially inappropriate medications (PIM), potential drug-drug interactions (DDI), and drug-cancer treatment interactions (DCI). For a large cohort of vulnerable older adults with advanced cancer starting treatment, we describe patterns of prescription and nonprescription medication usage, the prevalence of PIM, and the prevalence, severity, and type of DDI/DCI. METHODS: This secondary analysis used baseline data from a randomized study enrolling patients aged ≥70 years with advanced cancer starting a new systemic cancer treatment (University of Rochester Cancer Center [URCC] 13059; PI: Mohile). PIM were categorized using 2019 Beers criteria and Screening Tool of Older Persons' Prescriptions. Potential DDI/DCI were evaluated using Lexi-Interact Online. Medication classification followed the World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical system. Bivariate associations were evaluated between sociodemographic and geriatric assessment (GA) measures and medication measures. Chord diagrams and network analysis were used to understand and describe DDI/DCI. RESULTS: Among 718 patients (mean age 77.6 years), polypharmacy (≥5 medications), excessive polypharmacy (≥10 medications), and ≥1 PIM were identified in 61.3%,14.5%, and 67.1%, respectively. Cardiovascular medications were the most prevalent (47%), and nonprescription medications accounted for 26% of total medications and 40% of PIM. One-quarter of patients had ≥1 potential major DDI not involving cancer treatment, and 5.4% had ≥1 potential major DCI. Each additional medication increased the odds of a potential major DDI and DCI by 39% and 12%, respectively.",research

Abstract: AIMS: To present an updated overview on the safety of concurrent use of food, herbal or dietary supplement and warfarin. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed on 5 databases from inception up to 31 December 2019. These interactions were classified depending on the likelihood of interaction and supporting evidences. RESULTS: A total of 149 articles describing 78 herbs, food or dietary supplements were reported to interact with warfarin. These reports described potentiation with 45 (57.7%) herbs, food or dietary supplements while 23 (29.5%) reported inhibition and 10 (12.8%) reported limited impact on warfarin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Twenty unique herb and dietary supplements also reported to result in minor bleeding events, such as purpura and gum bleeding as well as major events such as intracranial bleeding that led to death. CONCLUSION: While most food, herbs and supplements can be safely taken in moderation, healthcare professionals should be aware of the increased risk of bleeding when taking several food and herbs. These include Chinese wolfberry, chamomile tea, cannabis, cranberry, chitosan, green tea, Ginkgo biloba, ginger, spinach, St. John's Wort, sushi and smoking tobacco.

Abstract: Over 70% of Americans take some form of dietary supplement every day, and the supplement industry is currently big business, with a gross of over $28 billion. However, unlike either foods or drugs, supplements do not need to be registered or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prior to production or sales. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, the FDA is restricted to adverse report monitoring postmarketing. Despite widespread consumption, there is limited evidence of health benefits related to nutraceutical or supplement use in well-nourished adults. In contrast, a small number of these products have the potential to produce significant toxicity. In addition, patients often do not disclose supplement use to their physicians. Therefore, the risk of adverse drug-supplement interactions is significant. An overview of the major supplement and nutraceutical classes is presented here, together with known toxic effects and the potential for drug interactions.",research

Abstract: Drug interactions can have significant consequences for public health, especially given the growing importance of readily available dietary supplements. The same applies to the consumption of fruit and fruit juices, which are often praised for their health benefits, but which can generate drug interactions. These are well known and documented in the case of grapefruit, which should not be taken with certain medications. Grapefruit contains flavonoids and furanocoumarins, which are responsible for various interactions with the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. However, for young children and the elderly, fruit juices are often used to facilitate treatment. This review examines commonly used fruit juices, particularly from citrus, apple, and red fruits, and discusses potential interactions, disadvantages, and advantages, as well as the chemical structures involved in interactions with cytochromes P-450, P-glycoprotein, and organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP), responsible for sometimes dangerous changes in bioavailability or potential accumulation of drugs in the body.",research

Published: 2019

Abstract: Probiotics have been used to treat a variety of diseases for decades; however, what is the rationale for their application? Such a treatment was first proposed in the early nineteenth century based on observations of decreased bifidobacterial populations in children suffering from diarrhea, suggesting that oral intake of bifidobacteria could replete this subpopulation of the microbiota and improve health. Since then, studies have shown modifications in the gut or skin microbiota in the course of a variety of diseases and suggested positive effects of certain probiotics. Most studies failed to report any impact on the microbiota. The impact of probiotics as well as of bacteria colonizing food does not reside in their ability to graft in the microbiota but rather in sharing genes and metabolites, supporting challenged microbiota, and directly influencing epithelial and immune cells. Such observations argue that probiotics could be associated with conventional drugs for insulin resistance, infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases, and psychiatric disorders and could also interfere with drug metabolism. Nevertheless, in the context of a plethora of probiotic strains and associations produced in conditions that do not allow direct comparisons, it remains difficult to know whether a patient would benefit from taking a particular probiotic. In other words, although several mechanisms are observed when studying a single probiotic strain, not all individual strains are expected to share the same effects. To clarify the role of probiotics in the clinic, we explored the relation between probiotics and the gut and skin microbiota.",research

Abstract: Riboflavin (RF) is a water-soluble member of the B-vitamin family. Sufficient dietary and supplemental RF intake appears to have a protective effect on various medical conditions such as sepsis, ischemia etc., while it also contributes to the reduction in the risk of some forms of cancer in humans. These biological effects of RF have been widely studied for their anti-oxidant, anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive and anti-cancer properties. Moreover, the combination of RF and other compounds or drugs can have a wide variety of effects and protective properties, and diminish the toxic effect of drugs in several treatments. Research has been done in order to review the latest findings about the link between RF and different clinical aberrations. Since further studies have been published in this field, it is appropriate to consider a re-evaluation of the importance of RF in terms of its beneficial properties.",research

DOACs were initially considered drugs with no significant food interactions; however, clinical observations from daily practice have proved otherwise as interactions with food ingredients have been reported. Food, dietary supplements or herbs may contain substances that, when administered concomitantly with DOACs, can potentially affect the plasma concentration of the drugs. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the clinical significance of drug-food interactions of DOACs, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban.

Abstract: Use of herbal medications and supplements has experienced immense growth over the last two decades, with retail sales in the USA exceeding $13 billion in 2021. Since the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994 reduced FDA oversight, these products have become less regulated. Data from 2012 shows 18% of U.S. adults used non-vitamin, non-mineral natural products. Prevalence varies regionally, with higher use in Western states. Among preoperative patients, the most commonly used herbal medications included garlic, ginseng, ginkgo, St. John's wort, and echinacea. However, 50-70% of surgical patients fail to disclose their use of herbal medications to their physicians, and most fail to discontinue them preoperatively. Since herbal medications can interact with anesthetic medications administered during surgery, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA) recommend stopping herbal medications 1-2 weeks before elective surgical procedures. Potential adverse drug effects related to preoperative use of herbal medications involve the coagulation system (e.g., increasing the risk of perioperative bleeding), the cardiovascular system (e.g., arrhythmias, hypotension, hypertension), the central nervous system (e.g., sedation, confusion, seizures), pulmonary (e.g., coughing, bronchospasm), renal (e.g., diuresis) and endocrine-metabolic (e.g., hepatic dysfunction, altered metabolism of anesthetic drugs). During the preoperative evaluation, anesthesiologists should inquire about the use of herbal medications to anticipate potential adverse drug interactions during the perioperative period.",research

Abstract: Statin therapy has a very important role in decreasing cardiovascular risk, and treatment non-compliance may therefore be a concern in high cardiovascular risk patients. Myotoxicity is a frequent side effect of statin therapy and one of the main causes of statin discontinuation, which limits effective treatment of patients at risk of or with cardiovascular disease. Because of the high proportion of patients on statin treatment and the frequency of statin-related myotoxicity, this is a subject of concern in clinical practice. However, statin-related myotoxicity is probably underestimated because there is not a gold standard definition, and its diagnosis is challenging. Moreover, information about pathophysiology and optimal therapeutic options is scarce. Therefore, this paper reviews the knowledge about the definition, pathophysiology and predisposing conditions, diagnosis and management of statin-related myotoxicity, and provides a practical scheme for its management in clinical practice.",research

Abstract: Food supplements and herbal products are increasingly popular amongst consumers. This leads to increased risks of interactions between prescribed drugs and these products containing bioactive ingredients. From 1991 up to 2014, 55 cases of suspected adverse drug reactions due to concomitant intake of health-enhancing products and drugs were reported to Lareb, the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre. An overview of these suspected interactions is presented and their potential mechanisms of action are described. Mainly during the metabolism of xenobiotics and due to the pharmacodynamics effects interactions seem to occur, which may result in adverse drug reactions. Where legislation is seen to distinct food and medicine, legislation concerning these different bioactive products is less clear-cut. This can only be resolved by increasing the molecular knowledge on bioactive substances and their potential interactions. Thereby potential interactions can be better understood and prevented on an individual level. By considering the dietary pattern and use of bioactive substances with prescribed medication, both health professionals and consumers will be increasingly aware of interactions and these interactive adverse effects can be prevented.",research

Design: This mouse study has implicated four investigational arms dedicated to control, Salvia officinalis aqueous extract, Salvia lavandulaefolia-encapsulated essential oil and a mix thereof (Cognivia™) for 2 weeks of administration. Cognitive functions have been assessed throughout Y-maze and Morris water maze models. The impact of supplementation on lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, neurogenesis, neuronal activity, neurotrophins, neurotrophin receptors, CaM kinase II and glucocorticoid receptors has been assessed via post-interventional tissue collection. Results: All Salvia groups had a significant effect on Y-maze markers on day 1 of administration. Only the mix of two Salvia species demonstrated significant improvements in Morris water maze markers at the end of administration. Considering all biological and histological markers, we did not observe any significant effect of S. officinalis, S. lavandulaefolia and a mix of Salvia supplementation on lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress and neuronal plasticity (neurogenesis, neuronal activity, neurotrophins). Interestingly, CaM kinase II protein expression is significantly increased in animals supplemented with Salvia.",research

Authors: Emily C Keats, Batool A Haider, Emily Tam et al. Published: Mar 2019

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Multiple-micronutrient (MMN) deficiencies often coexist among women of reproductive age in low- and middle-income countries. They are exacerbated in pregnancy due to the increased demands of the developing fetus, leading to potentially adverse effects on the mother and baby. A consensus is yet to be reached regarding the replacement of iron and folic acid supplementation with MMNs. Since the last update of this Cochrane Review in 2017, evidence from several trials has become available. The findings of this review will be critical to inform policy on micronutrient supplementation in pregnancy. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits of oral multiple-micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy on maternal, fetal and infant health outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: For this 2018 update, on 23 February 2018 we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and reference lists of retrieved studies. We also contacted experts in the field for additional and ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: All prospective randomised controlled trials evaluating MMN supplementation with iron and folic acid during pregnancy and its effects on pregnancy outcomes were eligible, irrespective of language or the publication status of the trials. We included cluster-randomised trials, but excluded quasi-randomised trials. Trial reports that were published as abstracts were eligible. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.",research

Of these 20 trials, 19 were conducted in low- and middle-income countries and compared MMN supplements with iron and folic acid to iron, with or without folic acid. One trial conducted in the UK compared MMN supplementation with placebo. In total, eight trials were cluster-randomised.MMN with iron and folic acid versus iron, with or without folic acid (19 trials)MMN supplementation probably led to a slight reduction in preterm births (average risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.01; 18 trials, 91,425 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and babies considered small-for-gestational age (SGA) (average RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.97; 17 trials; 57,348 participants; moderate-quality evidence), though the CI for the pooled effect for preterm births just crossed the line of no effect. MMN reduced the number of newborn infants identified as low birthweight (LBW) (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.91; 18 trials, 68,801 participants; high-quality evidence). We did not observe any differences between groups for perinatal mortality (average RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.11; 15 trials, 63,922 participants; high-quality evidence). MMN supplementation led to slightly fewer stillbirths (average RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.04; 17 trials, 97,927 participants; high-quality evidence) but, again, the CI for the pooled effect just crossed the line of no effect.

We found that results were consistent with the main analyses for all outcomes. We explored heterogeneity through subgroup analyses by maternal height, maternal body mass index (BMI), timing of supplementation, dose of iron, and MMN supplement formulation (UNIMMAP versus non-UNIMMAP).

MMN supplementation in pregnancy led to a reduction in babies considered LBW, and probably led to a reduction in babies considered SGA. In addition, MMN probably reduced preterm births. No important benefits or harms of MMN supplementation were found for mortality outcomes (stillbirths, perinatal and neonatal mortality). These findings may provide some basis to guide the replacement of iron and folic acid supplements with MMN supplements for pregnant women residing in low- and middle-income countries.",research

Authors: Russel J Reiter, Luiz Gustavo De Almeida Chuffa, Vinícius Augusto Simão et al. Published: Dec 2024

Abstract: Significant advancements have been made in cancer therapy; however, limitations remain with some conventional approaches. Adjuvants are agents used alongside primary treatments to enhance their efficacy and the treatment outcomes of patients. Modern lifestyles contribute to deficiencies in melatonin and vitamin D. Limited sun exposure affects vitamin D synthesis, and artificial light at night suppresses melatonin production. Both melatonin and vitamin D possess anti‑inflammatory, immune‑boosting and anticancer properties, rendering them potential adjuvants of interest. Studies suggest melatonin and vitamin D supplementation may address antioxidant imbalances in lip, oral and pharyngeal cancers. Moreover, promising results from breast, head and neck, brain, and osteosarcoma research indicate potential for tumor growth inhibition, improved survival, and a better quality of life of patients with cancer. The radioprotective properties of melatonin and vitamin D are another exciting area of exploration, potentially enhancing radiotherapy effectiveness while reducing side effects. For its part, the sleep‑promoting effects of melatonin may indirectly benefit patients with cancer by influencing the immune system. Thus, the prevalence of vitamin D and melatonin deficiencies highlights the importance of supplementation, as lower levels can worsen side‑effects from cancer treatments. The present review explores the potential of combining melatonin and vitamin D as synergistic adjuvants for cancer therapy. These agents have shown promise individually in cancer prevention and treatment, and their combined effects warrant investigation.",research

Abstract: This study explores the potential use of ChatGPT, an AI-based language model, in assessing herbal-drug interactions (HDi) to enhance clinical decision-making. HDi can pose significant health risks by reducing drug efficacy or causing unwanted side effects. Clinical pharmacists play a key role in identifying these HDIs, and currently, there are limited tools available for checking drug interactions. The research focuses on a case study of a rectal adenocarcinoma patient treated with capecitabine and 26 supplements, which contain a total of 80 herbal substances. ChatGPT 3.5 was asked three questions regarding potential HDIs: ""Are there possible HDIs?"", ""What is the pharmacokinetic mechanism?"", and ""What is the bibliographic source of the interaction?"". The results were reviewed by an oncology clinical pharmacist and compared to existing databases and independent bibliographic research. The findings highlight ChatGPT's advantage in processing large amounts of data quickly, with 16% of interactions classified as ""unlikely"", confirmed by the pharmacist. However, 73% of the suggested mechanisms were false positives, and 4% were categorized as ""hallucinations"". Additionally, most of the bibliographic sources provided by ChatGPT were outdated or unavailable. While ChatGPT proves useful for initial HDI screening, its limitations include outdated data (last updated in January 2022), lack of access to private databases, and occasional inaccuracies. Further applications of AI in this area are recommended, though expert validation remains essential in the clinical decision-making process.",research

Abstract: By the turn of the twenty-first century, the use of nutraceuticals became increasingly popular in both humans and animals due to their easy access, cost-effectiveness, and tolerability with a wide margin of safety. While some nutraceuticals are safe, others have a toxic potential. For a large number of nutraceuticals, no toxicity/safety data are available due to a lack of pharmacological/toxicological studies. The safety of some nutraceuticals can be compromised via contamination with toxic plants, metals, mycotoxins, pesticides, fertilizers, drugs of abuse, etc. Knowledge of pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic studies appears to play a pivotal role in safety and toxicity assessment of nutraceuticals. Interaction studies are essential to determine efficacy, safety, and toxicity when nutraceuticals and therapeutic drugs are used concomitantly. This chapter describes various aspects of nutraceuticals, particularly their toxic potential, and the factors influencing their safety.",research

Published: 2019

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Vitamin D and magnesium (Mg) are some of the most studied topics in medicine with enormous implications for human health and disease. Majority of the adults are deficient in both vitamin D and magnesium but continue to go unrecognized by many health care professionals. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: Mg and vitamin D are used by all the organs in the body, and their deficiency states may lead to several chronic medical conditions. Studies described in the literature regarding these disease associations are contradictory, and reversal of any of these conditions may not occur for several years after adequate replacement. One should consider the supplementation therapy to be preventative rather than curative at this time. DATA SOURCES: PubMed search of several reported associations between vitamin D and Mg with diseases. RESULTS: Vitamin D and Mg replacement therapy in elderly patients is known to reduce the nonvertebral fractures, overall mortality, and the incidence of Alzheimer dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D screening assay is readily available, but the reported lower limit of the normal range is totally inadequate for disease prevention. Based on the epidemiologic studies, ∼75% of all adults worldwide have serum 25(OH)D levels of <30 ng/mL. Because of the recent increase in global awareness, vitamin D supplementation has become a common practice, but Mg deficiency still remains unaddressed. Screening for chronic magnesium deficiency is difficult because a normal serum level may still be associated with moderate to severe deficiency. To date, there is no simple and accurate laboratory test to determine the total body magnesium status in humans. Mg is essential in the metabolism of vitamin D, and taking large doses of vitamin D can induce severe depletion of Mg.",research

Published: Jul 2017

Abstract: The most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulants worldwide are the vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin. Factors affecting the pharmacokinetics of VKAs are important because deviations from their narrow therapeutic window can result in bleedings due to over-anticoagulation or thrombosis because of under-anticoagulation. In addition to pharmacodynamic interactions (e.g., augmented bleeding risk for concomitant use of NSAIDs), interactions with drugs, foods, herbs, and over-the-counter medications may affect the risk/benefit ratio of VKAs. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) including Factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) and thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) are poised to replace warfarin. Phase-3 studies and real-world evaluations have established that the safety profile of DOACs is superior to those of VKAs. However, some pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions are expected. Herein we present a critical review of VKAs and DOACs with focus on their potential for interactions with drugs, foods, herbs and over-the-counter medications.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This review provides a summary of the currently available clinical data on drug-drug interactions (DDIs) involving over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. It aims to educate and increase awareness among health care providers and to support decisions in daily practice. METHODS: An extensive literature search was performed using bibliographic databases available through PubMed.gov. An initial structured search was performed using the keywords ""drug-drug-interaction AND (over-the-counter OR OTC),"" without further restrictions except for the language. The initial results were screened for all described DDIs involving OTC drugs, and further information was gathered specifically on these drugs using dedicated database searches and references found in the bibliography from the initial hits. RESULTS: From more than 1200 initial hits (1972-June 2021), 408 relevant publications were screened for DDIs involving OTC drugs, leading to 2 major findings: first, certain types of drug regimens are more prone to DDIs or have more serious DDI-related consequences, such as antiretroviral, anti-infective, and oral anticancer therapies. Second, although most DDIs involve OTC drugs as the perpetrators, some prescription drugs (statins or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors) that currently have OTC status can be identified as the victims in DDIs. The following groups were identified to be frequently involved in DDIs: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, food supplements, antacids, proton-pump inhibitors, H2 antihistamines, laxatives, antidiarrheal drugs, and herbal drugs. CONCLUSIONS: The most significant finding was the lack of high-quality evidence for commonly acknowledged interactions. High-quality interaction studies involving different phenotypes in drug metabolism (cytochrome P450) and distribution (transporters) are urgently needed.",research

Abstract: Use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) and over-the-counter (OTC) medications are very common among HIV-infected patients. These products can cause clinically significant drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with antiretroviral (ARV) medications, thereby increasing risk for negative outcomes such as toxicity or loss of virologic control. Areas covered: This article provides an updated review of the different mechanisms by which CAM and OTC products are implicated in DDIs with ARV medications. Expert commentary: Much of the literature published to date involves studies of CAMs interacting with older ARV agents via the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system. However, the HIV treatment and prevention arsenal is continually evolving. Furthermore, our elucidation of the role of non-CYP450 mediated DDIs with ARV medications is greatly increasing. Therefore, clinicians are well served to understand the various mechanisms and extent by which new ARV therapies may be involved in drug interactions with CAMs and OTC medications.",research

Abstract: Consumption of plant-derived natural products and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs is increasing on a global scale, and studies of phytochemical-OTC drug interactions are becoming more significant. The intake of dietary plants and herbs rich in phytochemicals may affect drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) and transporters. These effects may lead to alterations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of OTC drugs when concomitantly administered. Some phytochemical-drug interactions benefit patients through enhanced efficacy, but many interactions cause adverse effects. This review discusses possible mechanisms of phytochemical-OTC drug interactions mediated by phase I and II DMEs and phase III transporters. In addition, current information is summarized for interactions between phytochemicals derived from fruits, vegetables, and herbs and OTC drugs, and counseling is provided on appropriate and safe use of OTC drugs.",research

Abstract: Oncology patients undergoing radiation treatment and chemotherapy routinely use prescription and/or over-the counter medications either as part of pre-existing comorbid conditions or in the context of conventional treatment management. A growing amount of data suggest that commonly used pharmaceuticals possess antioxidant properties, which may also partially explain some of their therapeutic efficacy. Clinical research is continuing on how such agents interact during chemotherapy and radiation when oxidative mechanisms of action are involved. Historically, such discussions centered on the category of dietary supplements, natural health products, fruits and vegetables, along with established protectant medications. Evidence confirms that some pharmaceutical agents exhibit antioxidant properties similar to dietary supplements, protectants, and may hence hinder the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Awareness by both healthcare providers and patients in this area is often lacking. After reviewing some of the more common and well-established pharmaceuticals, which include those prescribed during cancer treatment, caution needs to be advised especially in regards to the use of corticosteroids, as long-term randomized outcome studies ensuring safety in this area are still outstanding.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as apixaban, are the most commonly prescribed anticoagulants, with advantages in that they do not require routine monitoring. However, less frequent contact with healthcare professionals may contribute to poor patient knowledge about potential interactions between over-the-counter (OTC) products and DOACs. OBJECTIVE: Determine the prevalence of use of OTC products (OTC medications and dietary supplements) with potentially serious apixaban interactions and assess patient knowledge of potential interactions. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Academic-affiliated outpatient medical practices in northern and southern California. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 791 English- or Spanish-speaking patients prescribed apixaban. MEASUREMENTS: Use and knowledge of OTC medications and dietary supplements with potentially serious apixaban interactions. RESULTS: Almost all respondents (n = 771; 97.5%) reported OTC product use. Of respondents, 33% (n = 266) took at least one OTC product with potentially serious apixaban interactions daily/most days and 53 (6.7%) took multiple products (mean = 2.6 [SD = 2.6]).

Abstract: Over-the-counter (OTC) products such as pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, vitamins, and herbal remedies are widely available and copiously used by older adults for health maintenance and symptom management. Owing to physiology, multimorbidity, and polypharmacy, this population is particularly vulnerable to inappropriate use of OTC products, adverse effects, and drug interactions. While OTC pharmaceuticals are bound by FDA-approved standards, dietary supplements are regulated differently, resulting in variable quality and increased possibility for adulteration. Internationally, standards for OTC products vary widely. Accessible educational information, improved provider-patient communication, and revision of regulatory policy could improve safety for older adult users of OTC products.",research

Resources for avoiding disease-drug interactions in patients with rare conditions, such as myasthenia gravis, glucose-6-phosphate deficiency, mitochondriopathies and long QT-syndrome are given. We also discuss methods for avoiding disease-drug interactions in clinical practice. These include awareness, regular diagnosis- and drug-history taking, consulting the product information, good communication between healthcare providers and patient education.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Heartburn and other symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux occur in ~30% of survey respondents in multiple countries worldwide. Heartburn and acid regurgitation are common complaints in the pharmacy, where patients frequently seek relief through medication and advice. The growing number of proton-pump inhibitors available in the over-the-counter setting provides an efficacious choice to patients experiencing frequent heartburn. Pharmacists can assist patients in their treatment decisions whilst inquiring about alarm symptoms that should prompt a physician referral. Aim of the review Provide pharmacists with a review of current clinical research and expert guidelines on use of over-the-counter proton-pump inhibitors. METHODS: This narrative review was conducted to identify publications relevant to the following themes: overview of available treatments for frequent episodes of heartburn/acid regurgitation; treatment algorithms providing guidance on when to use over-the-counter proton-pump inhibitors; and the role of the pharmacist in the use of over-the-counter proton-pump inhibitors. RESULTS: Frequent symptoms of acid reflux, such as heartburn and acid regurgitation, can interfere substantially with daily life activities. Proton-pump inhibitors are the most efficacious treatment for frequent reflux symptoms and are recommended as an appropriate initial treatment in uncomplicated cases.

Abstract: Various herbal medicines have been used around the world for more than 5,000 years. Herbal medicines, or herbal supplements, are defined as any products originating from plants and used to preserve or recover health. In the United States, the popularity of herbal supplements has increased in the last several decades. Many physicians do not ask patients about herbal supplement use, and one-third of patients do not inform their physician about supplement use. However, physicians should ask, because although many supplements are considered low risk and safe, some have significant risks of adverse effects. For example, St John's wort (",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) can negatively affect pharmacotherapy. However, pediatric DDI studies are scarce. We undertook an exploratory study to investigate prevalence and clinical relevance of DDIs between cytostatic and noncytostatic drugs in outpatient pediatric oncology patients. PROCEDURE: After informed consent and inclusion, the following information was collected: currently prescribed noncytostatic and cytostatic drugs, comorbidities, and use of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs), and dietary supplements. All medication was screened for DDIs according to two databases: Micromedex RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were included (median age 8.9 years). A total of 67 different DDIs were counted (66 in Micromedex CONCLUSIONS: This study resulted in a selection of 11 potentially clinically relevant DDIs for 73 outpatients in our pediatric oncology department. Interventions were formulated in close collaboration between physicians and clinical pharmacists. Future research should focus on assessing DDIs concerning QTc-interval prolongation.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The escalating use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) raises concerns, particularly among geriatric patients taking multiple medications. Notably, the doubled chance of major drug interactions between prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs in older adults underscores the need for further research. This study aimed to evaluate clinically significant CAM and prescription medication interactions in a geriatric clinic, emphasizing the growing importance of understanding CAM implications in health care. METHODS: A 2-year cross-sectional study, approved by the Institutional Review Board, enrolled 420 participants aged 65 and older from a geriatric primary care clinic. Participants completed a survey, and pharmacy students conducted chart reviews to evaluate potential CAM products and prescription medication interactions. RESULTS: Among the 420 participants-who were predominantly White females and who were taking supplements, OTC medications, or both-15.6% experienced potential drug interactions.  CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the significant use of CAM and/or OTC medications, particularly among vulnerable older adults, revealing a concerning 15.6% rate of potential drug interactions. The findings emphasized the need for awareness among health care practitioners and standardized CAM surveys to enhance accuracy and patient safety.",research

Abstract: Background The risks associated with over-the-counter medication are often underestimated by consumers. The incorrect use of certain medications can lead to significant patient harm. Inappropriate use can be prevented by pharmaceutical counselling. Objective To determine the number and nature of drug-related problems in over-the-counter medication with a special emphasis on high-risk over-the-counter medications. Setting Fifty-two community pharmacies in Finland. Method This observational study was conducted as a questionnaire survey. The pharmacists working in participating pharmacies documented the observed drug-related problems and pharmacy interventions in over-the-counter medication during 1 week using an electronic study form based on the Westerlund drug-related problem classification system. Main outcome measure The prevalence of drug-related problems and problem types in different medication categories. Results The 52 community pharmacies documented 339 drug-related problems in 0.6% of over-the-counter customers, the most common problem being ""Uncertainty about the indication for the drug"" (39.2%). A significant proportion of the documented problems (26.3%) concerned high-risk over-the-counter medications, and the majority of these cases were associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (21.8%). In total, pharmacies made 641 interventions to resolve the drug-related problems. For majority of drug-related problems (87%), pharmacist's intervention involved counselling.

Published: Sep 2024

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to provide an overview of common drug-drug interactions (DDIs) associated with prostate cancer treatments and outline recommendations for managing polypharmacy. DATA SOURCES: A literature search of PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL was carried out to identify pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes caused by DDIs that are relevant for prostate cancer patients, DDIs between prostate cancer therapies and co-administered medications (both prescription and over-the-counter), and measures to prevent DDIs. Medication package inserts were used to identify the impact of DDI on the prostate cancer therapy and suggested interventions. DATA SUMMARY: No DDIs are expected for the LHRH agonists leuprolide acetate, histrelin, goserelin, or leuprolide mesylate. However, DDIs have been reported for GnRH antagonists, anti-androgens, PARP inhibitors, and taxanes. Although there are no confirmed DDIs for sipuleucel-T to date, it is not generally recommended to use sipuleucel-T concurrently with immunosuppressive medications. Interventions to prevent DDIs include the use of software that can detect clinically significant DDIs, up-to-date medication reconciliation, the inclusion of dedicated clinical pharmacists in cancer treatment teams, and patient/caregiver education. CONCLUSIONS: Prostate cancer patients have a high risk of potential DDIs due to numerous new anti-cancer therapies, the increased use of treatment combinations, and the likelihood of comorbid conditions also requiring drug therapy. Drug-drug interaction screening software, up-to-date medication reconciliation, inclusion of oncology pharmacists on healthcare teams, and patient/caregiver education will aid the development of treatment plans that focus on achieving an optimal risk-benefit profile whilst reducing the risk of DDIs.",research

Abstract: Ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced photoageing of the skin is associated with characteristic clinical features including a sallow complexion, deep, coarse wrinkles and a loss of elasticity. Remodelling of the dermal extracellular matrix (ECM) with changes to fibrillar collagens, elastic fibres and glycosaminoglycans is likely to be a major contributing factor to these particular clinical signs. Over-the-counter (OTC) topical formulations are one popular management strategy for preventing and/or repairing photoaged skin, most commonly targeting wrinkles as these are often the most concerning clinical feature. Due to the cosmetic nature of such formulations, evidence of their clinical efficacy and mechanism of action is often limited. However, these formulations usually contain putative active ingredients which individually have been subject to in vitro and in vivo investigation for efficacy as photoageing interventions. This review highlights commonly found ingredients within OTC formulations and assesses the evidence for: (i) their efficacy in clinically and histologically improving photoaged skin; (ii) the potential mechanisms of action; and (iii) their ability to act synergistically with complementary ingredients to enhance the clinical outcome.",research

Published: Dec 2017

Abstract: The number of older HIV-infected people is growing due to increasing life expectancies resulting from the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Both HIV and aging increase the risk of other comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and some malignancies, leading to greater challenges in managing HIV with other conditions. This results in complex medication regimens with the potential for significant drug-drug interactions and increased morbidity and mortality. Area covered: We review the metabolic pathways of ART and other medications used to treat medical co-morbidities, highlight potential areas of concern for drug-drug interactions, and where feasible, suggest alternative approaches for treating these conditions as suggested from national guidelines or articles published in the English language. Expert commentary: There is limited evidence-based data on ART drug interactions, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the older HIV-infected population. Choosing and maintaining effective ART regimens for older adults requires consideration of side effect profile, individual comorbidities, interactions with concurrent prescriptions and non-prescription medications and supplements, dietary patterns with respect to dosing, pill burden and ease of dosing, cost and affordability, patient preferences, social situation, and ART resistance history. Practitioners must remain vigilant for potential drug interactions and intervene when there is a potential for harm.",research

Published: Dec 2019

Abstract: Clinically relevant adverse drug reactions differ between men and women. The underlying physiological and pharmacological processes contributing to these differences are infrequently studied or reported. As gene expression, cellular regulatory pathways, and integrated physiological functions differ between females and males, aggregating data from combined groups of men and women obscures the ability to detect these differences. This paper summarizes how genetic sex, that is, the presence of sex chromosomes XY for male or XX for female, and the influence of sex hormones affect transporters, receptors, and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Changing levels of sex steroids throughout life, including increases at puberty, changes with pregnancy, and decreases with age, may directly and indirectly affect drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination. The direct and indirect effects of sex steroids in the form of exogenous hormones such as those used in hormonal contraceptives, menopausal hormone treatments, transgender therapy, and over-the-counter performance enhancing drugs may interfere with metabolism of other pharmaceuticals, and these interactions may vary by dose, formulation, and mode of delivery (oral, injection, or transdermal) of the steroid hormones. Few drugs have sex-specific labeling or dosing recommendations. Furthermore, there is limited literature evaluating how the circulating levels of sex steroids impact drug efficacy or adverse reactions. Such research is needed in order to improve the understanding of the impact of sex hormones on pharmacological therapies, particularly as medicine moves toward individualizing treatments.",research

Abstract: Current demographic data clearly show that the North American population is aging, and projections suggest that the percentage of older people will increase. The elderly often suffer from multiple chronic conditions that affect their quality of life, use of health services, morbidity and mortality. Also, in those of advanced age, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many drugs are altered. Polypharmacy increases the incidence of adverse drug reactions and drug interactions in this population. Thus, the dentist must be continually aware of the pharmacologic status of each patient and consider the likelihood of interactions between drugs prescribed by the dentist, drugs prescribed by the physician and drugs that are self-administered, including over-the-counter medications and natural supplements. In this article, we discuss pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes in the elderly patient, polypharmacy and the changes in prescribing for our dental patients. Specific emphasis is placed on the drugs commonly prescribed by dentists: local anesthetics, analgesics and antibiotics.",research

Abstract: Although drugs can be an essential and lifesaving component of the care of adult patients, their use frequently is accompanied by adverse effects and life-threatening adverse drug reactions that can result in significant disability and mortality. The potential for drug-related severe morbidity and mortality is compounded during periods of hospitalization, when high-risk drugs such as anticoagulants or insulin are used, and when care in an intensive care unit is required. Patient factors in adults that can increase the risk of drug harms include immunosuppression, cognitive impairment, depression, alcoholism and other substance abuse disorders, chronic kidney disease, hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathies, limited English proficiency, institutional/nursing home care, and underinsurance or lack of insurance. Physician factors that can increase the risk of drug harms include inappropriate prescribing of drugs (including to pregnant and breastfeeding women), failure to appropriately discontinue/deprescribe drugs, insufficient drug reconciliation, failure to coordinate care among multiple prescribing clinicians, and failure to elicit and incorporate into health histories and clinical decision-making the widespread use of nonprescription drugs, herbal products, and dietary supplements.",research

Abstract: University students experience high prevalence of mental health problems and exacerbation of mental health difficulties, including sleep disturbances and stress during their studies. Stress and poor sleep quality and/or insomnia are interlinked outcomes for this population. The aim was to conduct a systematic review, and meta-analyses, of the relationships between sleep quality and/or insomnia with stress in students. Full-text articles of studies exploring the associations of stress with poor sleep quality and/or insomnia in undergraduate students using validated tools and published in peer-reviewed journals were eligible for inclusion. Thirty-four studies, resulting in 37 effect sizes, included and all were suitable for meta-analysis. The weighted pooled effect size between sleep quality and stress was for 0.39 (25 studies, n = 10,065), whereas a slightly higher pooled association of 0.41 was demonstrated for insomnia and stress (12 studies, n = 5564.5). Pooled associations show moderate effects for associations between sleep quality, insomnia and stress in undergraduate students. High heterogeneity in meta-analyses was found, suggesting the findings should be considered cautiously. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies exploring sleep difficulties across the academic year, whilst university services should consider psychoeducation for stress and sleep in university students, especially during transition to university.",research

Abstract: Patients with insomnia frequently use acupuncture as an alternative treatment to pharmacotherapy globally. The aim of this paper is to assess the effect of acupuncture on insomnia. Seven medical databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CNKI, RISS, NDSL, and OASIS, were used to identify studies published through July 09, 2020. Twenty-four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this qualitative review comparing acupuncture to either pharmacotherapy or sham-acupuncture therapy. Methodological quality was assessed, using the Cochrane risk of bias (ROB). In the subsequent quantitative meta-analysis of studies comparing acupuncture versus pharmacotherapy, fifteen RCTs demonstrated that acupuncture had a significant effect on patients with insomnia as assessed by the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) (RR: -0.74; 95% CI: -1.07 to -0.40; [Formula: see text] ¡0.0001; [Formula: see text] = 89%; [Formula: see text] = 1475). A subgroup analysis showed that there was no significant effect after weeks 1 and 2, but six studies found that acupuncture had a significant effect insomnia at week 3 (RR: -0.97; 95% CI: -1.65 to -0.28; [Formula: see text] = 0.006; [Formula: see text] = 91%; [Formula: see text] = 463) and nine studies demonstrated a significant effect at week 4 (RR: -0.70; 95% CI: -1.15 to -0.25; [Formula: see text] = 0.002; [Formula: see text] = 85%; [Formula: see text] = 594).

Abstract: Insomnia is one of the most common and burdensome disorders in adults. We compared and ranked insomnia medication on the basis of their efficacy and tolerability. We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis of placebo-controlled or head-to-head randomized controlled trials for primary insomnia in adults comparing 20 drugs. We searched eight databases and seven trial registers from inception to March 1st, 2022. Primary outcomes included sleep latency (SL), awake time after sleep onset (WASO) and discontinuation for adverse events (AED), and secondary outcomes included total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), sleep quality (SQ) and adverse events (ADE). Pooled standardized mean differences or odds ratios with 95% credible intervals were estimated using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random-effects. Differences among trial findings were explored in subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Confidence in evidence was assessed using GRADE. The PROSPERO registered number is CRD42020182144. We identified 22,538 records and included 69 studies (17,319 patients). Orexin receptor antagonists (ORAs) are more efficacious than benzodiazepine-like drugs (Z-drugs) and placebo for WASO and SE, and better than melatonin receptor agonists (MRAs) for SL, WASO and SE. ORAs ranked the best in SL (SUCRA value: 0.84), WASO (0.93), TST (0.86) and SE (0.96). Lemborexant and daridorexant (two ORAs) showed greater efficacy than placebo for SL, WASO, and TST, with good tolerability. Z-drugs were more efficacious than placebo for SL, WASO, TST and SE, but with higher risk to safety. Zaleplon and eszopiclone had better efficacy than placebo for TST and SQ respectively. MRAs may also be efficacious for sleep-onset insomnia with good safety.",research

Abstract: Almost 70% of patients with mental disorders report sleep difficulties and 30% fulfill the criteria for insomnia disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the first-line treatment for insomnia according to current treatment guidelines. Despite this circumstance, insomnia is frequently treated only pharmacologically especially in patients with mental disorders. The aim of the present meta-analysis was to quantify the effects of CBT-I in patients with mental disorders and comorbid insomnia on two outcome parameters: the severity of insomnia and mental health. The databases PubMed, CINHAL (Ebsco) und PsycINFO (Ovid) were searched for randomized controlled trials on adult patients with comorbid insomnia and any mental disorder comparing CBT-I to placebo, waitlist or treatment as usual using self-rating questionnaires as outcomes for either insomnia or mental health or both. The search resulted in 1994 records after duplicate removal of which 22 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included for the meta-analysis. The comorbidities were depression (eight studies, 491 patients), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD, four studies, 216 patients), alcohol dependency (three studies, 79 patients), bipolar disorder (one study, 58 patients), psychosis (one study, 50 patients) and mixed comorbidities within one study (five studies, 189 patients). The effect sizes for the reduction of insomnia severity post treatment were 0.5 (confidence interval, CI, 0.3-0.8) for patients with depression, 1.5 (CI 1.0-1.9) for patients with PTSD, 1.4 (CI 0.9-1.9) for patients with alcohol dependency, 1.2 (CI 0.8-1.7) for patients with psychosis/bipolar disorder, and 0.8 (CI 0.1-1.6) for patients with mixed comorbidities.",research

There were no significant effects on comorbid symptoms at follow-up. Together, these significant, stable medium to large effects indicate that CBT-I is an effective treatment for patients with insomnia and a comorbid mental disorder, especially depression, PTSD and alcohol dependency. CBT-I is also an effective add-on treatment with the aim of improving mental health in patients with depression, PTSD, and symptom severity in outpatients with mixed diagnoses. Thus, in patients with mental disorders and comorbid insomnia, given the many side effects of medication, CBT-I should be considered as a first-line treatment.",research

Abstract: In the management of insomnia, physicians and patients are seeking alternative therapeutics to sleeping pills, in addition to sleep hygiene and cognitive behavioural therapy. Bright light therapy (LT) has proven its efficacy in circadian and mood disorders. We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis according to Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines and using the databases Medline, Cochrane, and Web of Science, with a special focus on light therapy and insomnia. Twenty-two studies with a total of 685 participants were included, five of which with a high level of proof. Meta-analysis was performed with 13 of them: light therapy for insomnia compared with control conditions significantly improved wake after sleep onset (WASO: SMD = -0.61 [-1.11, -0.11]; p = 0.017; weighted difference of 11.2 min ±11.5 based on actigraphy, and SMD = -1.09 [-1.43, -0.74] (p < 0.001) weighted difference of -36.4 min ±15.05) based on sleep diary, but no other sleep measures such as sleep latency, total sleep time (TST), or sleep efficiency. Qualitative analysis of the review showed some improvement mainly in subjective measures. Morning light exposure advanced sleep-wake rhythms and evening exposure led to a delay. No worsening was observed in objective nor subjective measures, except for TST in one study with evening exposure. A light dose-response may exist but the studies' heterogeneity and publication bias limit the interpretation. To conclude, light therapy shows some effectiveness for sleep maintenance in insomnia disorders, but further research is needed to refine the light parameters to be chosen according to the type of insomnia, in the hope of developing personalised therapeutics.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Menopause is the time that marks passing 12 months after the last menstruation cycle in women between ages 40-50. Menopausal women often experience depression and insomnia that significantly impact their overall well-being and quality of life. This systematic review aims to determine the effects of different therapeutic physiotherapy modalities on insomnia and depression in perimenopausal, menopausal, and post-menopausal women. METHODOLOGY: After identifying our inclusion/exclusion criteria, we conducted a database search in Ovid Embase, MIDRIS, PubMed, Cochrane, and ScienceOpen, where 4007 papers were identified. By using EndNote software, we excluded duplicates, unrelated, and non-full text papers. Adding more studies from manual search, we finally included 31 papers including 7 physiotherapy modalities: exercise, reflexology, footbath, walking, therapeutic and aromatherapy massage, craniofacial message, and yoga. RESULTS: Reflexology, yoga, walking and aromatherapy massage showed an overall significant impact on decreasing insomnia and depression in menopausal women. Most of exercise and stretching interventions also showed improvement in sleep quality but inconsistent findings regarding depression. However, insufficient evidence was found regarding the effect of craniofacial massage, footbath, and acupressure on improving sleep quality and depression in menopausal women. CONCLUSION: Using non-pharmaceutical interventions such as therapeutic and manual physiotherapy have an overall positive impact on reducing insomnia and depression in menopausal women.",research

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this systematic review is to provide supporting evidence for a clinical practice guideline on the use of behavioral and psychological treatments for chronic insomnia disorder in adult populations. METHODS: The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of 9 experts in sleep medicine and sleep psychology. A systematic review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials that addressed behavioral and psychological interventions for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. Statistical analyses were performed to determine if the treatments produced clinically significant improvements in a range of critical and important outcomes. Finally, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process was used to evaluate the evidence for making specific treatment recommendations. RESULTS: The literature search identified 1,244 studies; 124 studies met the inclusion criteria, and 89 studies provided data suitable for statistical analyses. Evidence for the following interventions is presented in this review: cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, brief therapies for insomnia, stimulus control, sleep restriction therapy, relaxation training, sleep hygiene, biofeedback, paradoxical intention, intensive sleep retraining, and mindfulness. This review provides a detailed summary of the evidence along with the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits vs harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations.",research

Abstract: Problems with sleep are reported to be common after stroke but the incidence and prevalence of insomnia and insomnia symptoms following stroke is not yet established. The aim of this review was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the incidence and prevalence of insomnia and insomnia symptoms in individuals affected by stroke. We searched seven main electronic databases to identify studies until September 25, 2018. No studies examining incidence of post-stroke insomnia were identified. Twenty-two studies on prevalence of insomnia or insomnia symptoms including individuals with stroke were included with fourteen studies suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis indicated pooled prevalence of 38.2% (CI 30.1-46.5) with significantly higher prevalence estimates for studies using non-diagnostic tools, 40.70% (CI 30.96-50.82) compared to studies using diagnostic assessment tools 32.21% (CI 18.5-47.64). Greater insomnia symptoms were indicated in those with comorbid depression and anxiety. The prevalence of both insomnia and insomnia symptoms are considerably higher in stroke survivors compared to the general population. Studies investigating the incidence, insomnia symptom profile and changes in insomnia prevalence over time are needed to inform clinical practice and to encourage tailored interventions that consider this symptomatology.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Magnesium supplementation is often purported to improve sleep; however, as both an over-the-counter sleep aid and a complementary and alternative medicine, there is limited evidence to support this assertion. The aim was to assess the effectiveness and safety of magnesium supplementation for older adults with insomnia. METHODS: A search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine, clinicaltrials.gov and two grey literature databases comparing magnesium supplementation to placebo or no treatment. Outcomes were sleep quality, quantity, and adverse events. Risk of bias and quality of evidence assessments were carried out using the RoB 2.0 and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approaches. Data was pooled and treatment effects were quantified using mean differences. For remaining outcomes, a modified effects direction plot was used for data synthesis. RESULTS: Three randomized control trials (RCT) were identified comparing oral magnesium to placebo in 151 older adults in three countries. Pooled analysis showed that post-intervention sleep onset latency time was 17.36 min less after magnesium supplementation compared to placebo (95% CI - 27.27 to - 7.44, p = 0.0006). Total sleep time improved by 16.06 min in the magnesium supplementation group but was statistically insignificant. All trials were at moderate-to-high risk of bias and outcomes were supported by low to very low quality of evidence.

Abstract: Insomnia is common, is associated with major adverse medical and mental health outcomes, has a negative impact on quality of life, and has significant economic consequences. However, little is known about the global insomnia burden. This systematic review estimated the global prevalence of insomnia in adults. PubMed and Embase were searched (terms ""insomnia,"" ""prevalence,"" and ""general population"") to identify relevant peer-reviewed studies (final search 2-3 Sep 2024). Included studies had the highest data quality and lowest risk of bias, and reported clinically relevant insomnia prevalence in the general population. Insomnia prevalence estimates were applied to United Nations (UN) population data using a country-specific study (if available) or the highest-quality study (if no country-specific study). Of 1651 potential records, 18 studies (262,582 participants) were included. Thirty-one of 237 UN/World Bank-recognized countries/territories had a suitable nation-specific adult insomnia prevalence estimate. 852,325,091 adults (95 % confidence interval 830,354,161-874,309,252) were estimated to have insomnia (global prevalence: 16.2 %) and 414,967,941 were estimated to have severe insomnia (7.9 %). Insomnia and severe insomnia were more prevalent in females versus males across all age groups. The high global prevalence of insomnia disorder reinforces the need for comprehensive public health and clinical sleep health initiatives worldwide. REGISTRATION: PROSPERO: CRD42024581410.",research

Abstract: We conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses to evaluate the efficacy of melatonin versus placebo or other hypnotic agents in improving sleep quality and quantity in patients with chronic insomnia. A literature search on Ovid-MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library was performed up to November 2020. Sleep onset latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep quality and quality of life were examined as outcomes. We identified 24 randomized controlled trials of chronic insomnia including four studies of patients with comorbid insomnia. All studies were compared with placebo. Due to heterogeneity, we conducted subgroup analyses by age group. In non-comorbid insomnia, melatonin was only significantly effective in sleep onset latency and total sleep time in children and adolescents. In adults group, melatonin was not significantly effective in improving sleep onset latency, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency. In comorbid insomnia, melatonin significantly improved sleep onset latency in all age groups, but there was only one study in adults group. In conclusion, melatonin did not appear to be effective in adults but might be effective in children and adolescents with chronic insomnia for both comorbid insomnia and non-comorbid insomnia.

Abstract: Insomnia disorder (ID) has become the second-most common mental disorder. Despite burgeoning evidence for increased high-frequency electroencephalography (EEG) activity and cortical hyperarousal in ID, the detailed spectral features of this disorder during wakefulness and different sleep stages remain unclear. Therefore, we adopted a meta-analytic approach to systematically assess existing evidence on EEG spectral features in ID. Hedges's g was calculated by 148 effect sizes from 24 studies involving 977 participants. Our results demonstrate that, throughout wakefulness and sleep, patients with ID exhibited increased beta band power, although such increases sometimes extended into neighboring frequency bands. Patients with ID also exhibited increased theta and gamma power during wakefulness, as well as increased alpha and sigma power during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In addition, ID was associated with decreased delta power and increased theta, alpha, and sigma power during NREM sleep. The EEG measures of absolute and relative power have similar sensitivity in detecting spectral features of ID during wakefulness and REM sleep; however, relative power appeared to be a more sensitive biomarker during NREM sleep. Our study is the first statistics-based review to quantify EEG power spectra across stages of sleep and wakefulness in patients with ID.",research

Abstract: Previous research has identified insomnia as a predictor for the onset of depression. The aim of this meta-analysis is to investigate whether insomnia also predicts the onset of other mental disorders. Longitudinal studies were eligible for inclusion if they investigated insomnia at baseline (including nighttime- and daytime-symptoms) as a predictor of the later onset of psychopathology within a follow-up time-frame of at least 12 mo. Thirteen primary studies were included. The results suggest that insomnia is a significant predictor for the onset of depression (10 studies, OR 2.83, CI 1.55-5.17), anxiety (six studies, OR 3.23, CI 1.52-6.85), alcohol abuse (two studies, OR 1.35, CI 1.08-1.67, and psychosis (one study, OR 1.28, CI 1.03-1.59). The overall risk of bias in the primary studies was moderate. This meta-analysis provides evidence that insomnia increases the risk for psychopathology. A future research agenda should include more prospective studies using established diagnostic criteria, assessing insomnia at baseline and including long-term follow-up intervals evaluating a wider range of mental disorders. In addition, prospective long-term interventional studies investigating the efficacy of insomnia treatment for the prevention of mental disorders are called for.",research

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Insomnia is a common sleep disorder. There are many clinical-intervention methods for treating this condition, but thus far, the most effective method has not been determined. METHODS: We conducted a network meta-analysis by including random evidence of insomnia improvement in people over 18 years old, without other physical diseases. From January 1, 1990 to June 15, 2022, we searched multiple electronic databases for randomized controlled trials of different insomnia-related, clinical-intervention methods. R software was used to analyze 10 indices, in order to evaluate the effect of sleep improvement. Primary outcomes comprised Pittsburgh sleep quality-index (PSQI) scores and insomnia severity-index (ISI) scores. RESULTS: Finally, 122 randomized controlled trials were included in our study. For the PSQI scores, we found the sequence of intervention measures by effect to be as follows: electroacupuncture, acupuncture, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), essential oils, herbal medicine, traditional Western medicine, Tai Chi and Baduanjin, music, supplements, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), and exercise. The results for ISI were similar to those for PSQI, but with slight differences. CONCLUSION: Our research results indicate that various measures have a certain effect on improving sleep, among which the effect of instruments is more prominent. The curative effect of placebo groups was better than that of blank control groups. There is essentially no statistical difference in detailed classification within the same intervention category.",research

Abstract: Despite the success of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and recent advances in pharmacotherapy, many patients with insomnia do not sufficiently respond to available treatments. This systematic review aims to present the state of science regarding the use of brain stimulation approaches in treating insomnia. To this end, we searched MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO from inception to 24 March 2023. We evaluated studies that compared conditions of active stimulation with a control condition or group. Outcome measures included standardized insomnia questionnaires and/or polysomnography in adults with a clinical diagnosis of insomnia. Our search identified 17 controlled trials that met inclusion criteria, and assessed a total of 967 participants using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial electric stimulation, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation or forehead cooling. No trials using other techniques such as deep brain stimulation, vestibular stimulation or auditory stimulation met the inclusion criteria. While several studies report improvements of subjective and objective sleep parameters for different repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial electric stimulation protocols, important methodological limitations and risk of bias limit their interpretability. A forehead cooling study found no significant group differences in the primary endpoints, but better sleep initiation in the active condition. Two transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation trials found no superiority of active stimulation for most outcome measures. Although modulating sleep through brain stimulation appears feasible, gaps in the prevailing models of sleep physiology and insomnia pathophysiology remain to be filled.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Anxiety conditions are debilitating and prevalent throughout the world. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an effective, acceptance-based behavioral therapy for anxiety. However, there are treatment barriers (eg, financial, geographical, and attitudinal), which prevent people from accessing it. To overcome these barriers, internet-delivered ACT (iACT) interventions have been developed in recent years. These interventions use websites to deliver ACT information and skill training exercises on the Web, either as pure self-help or with therapist guidance. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to examine the therapeutic impact of iACT on all anxiety conditions. METHODS: The EMBASE, MEDLINE, ProQuest Central, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched up to September 2018. The titles and abstracts of remaining records after deduplication were screened by 2 authors with a total of 36 full-text articles being retained for closer inspection next to eligibility criteria. Empirical studies of all designs, population types, and comparator groups were included if they appraised the impact of iACT treatment on any standardized measure of anxiety. Included studies were appraised on methodological quality and had their data extracted into a standardized coding sheet. Findings were then tabulated, and a narrative synthesis was performed because of the heterogeneity found between studies. RESULTS: A total of 20 studies met inclusion criteria. There were 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 9 uncontrolled pilot studies. Participants across all studies were adults.",research

A total of 18 studies reported significant anxiety reduction after iACT treatment. This was observed in studies that delivered iACT with (n=13) or without (n=5) therapist guidance. The average attrition rate across all included studies during the active iACT treatment phase was 19.19%. In the 13 studies that assessed treatment satisfaction, participants on average rated their iACT experience with above average to high treatment satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that iACT can be an efficacious and acceptable treatment for adults with GAD and general anxiety symptoms. More RCT studies are needed to corroborate these early iACT findings using empirical treatments in active control groups (eg, internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy). This would potentially validate the promising results found for SAD and IAD as well as address the full spectrum of anxiety disorders.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent mental health conditions and are managed predominantly in primary care. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of psychological and pharmacological treatments in countries with universal healthcare, and investigated the influence of treatment provider on the efficacy of psychological treatment. METHOD: PubMed, Cochrane, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Scopus were searched in April 2017 for controlled studies of evidence-based anxiety treatment in adults in primary care, published in English since 1997. Searches were repeated in April 2020. We synthesised results using a combination of meta-analysis and narrative methods.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are used to guide decision-making, especially regarding complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies that are unfamiliar to orthodox healthcare providers. This systematic review aimed to critically review and summarise CAM recommendations associated with anxiety management included in the existing CPGs. METHODS: Seven databases, websites of six international guidelines developing institutions, and the  RESULTS: Ten CPGs were included, with reporting rates between 51.4 and 88.6%. Seven of these were of moderate to high methodological quality. Seventeen CAM modalities were implicated, involving phytotherapeutics, mind-body practice, art therapy, and homeopathy. Applied relaxation was included in 70% CPGs, which varied in degree of support for its use in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. There were few recommendations for other therapies/products. Light therapy was not recommended for use in generalised anxiety disorder, and  CONCLUSION: Available guidelines are limited in providing logically explained graded CAM recommendations for anxiety treatment and care. A lack of high-quality evidence and multidisciplinary consultation during the guideline development are two major reasons. High quality and reliable clinical evidence and the engagement of a range of interdisciplinary stakeholders are needed for future CPG development and updating.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The growing worldwide prevalence of individuals with anxiety disorders has increased needs for mental health services. Due to limited number of mental health providers and community resources, especially in low-income countries, individuals often seek services from primary care settings. Through collaborative care models, services via telemedicine address the mental health provider shortage. While previous reviews show telemedicine effectively treats mental illness, a gap exists for reviews on videoconferencing psychological therapy for anxiety treatment. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to summarize videoconferencing psychological therapy for anxiety disorder treatment. METHODS: Database searches were performed with PubMed, PsychINFO and Embase. Inclusion criteria identified controlled and uncontrolled studies evaluating videoconferencing psychological therapy. Studies were appraised using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment tool. Data collected included research design, sample size, intervention details, outcome results, intervention effect size and differences between videoconferencing psychological therapy and face-to-face therapy. RESULTS: The search revealed 1253 articles, with 21 meeting inclusion criteria. Sample sizes ranged from 1 to 121 participants; cognitive-behavioral therapy was most commonly evaluated. Participants' diagnoses included panic disorder with and without agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, social phobia and hypochondriasis. Three studies occurred in outpatient health care settings. Fourteen studies reported statistically significant improvement on anxiety measures; 11 reported clinically significant improvements.",research

Abstract: CONTEXT: Anxiety disorders have a far-reaching impact on society, with profound implications on both mental and physical health. In response, there is growing interest in manual therapy modalities, with emerging research suggesting their potential to alleviate related symptoms. OBJECTIVES: To establish a consensus regarding manual therapy modalities for addressing anxiety symptoms, a systematic review of current literature was conducted. METHODS: A literature search was conducted between May and August 2023, utilizing a systematic search on both PubMed and Google Scholar, adhering to the defined inclusion criteria. In addition, information was gathered utilizing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Both authors (KLW and TH) conducted the literature review. The inclusion criteria include articles written in English, peer-reviewed, anxiety conditions documented, and manual therapy delivered by a respectfully qualified professional. Manual therapy modalities include massage therapy, osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), foot reflexology, acupressure, manual therapy, healing touch, therapeutic touch, and gentle touch. After initial data collection, both researchers independently screened articles utilizing two metrics: a level of evidence (LOE) table and a screening criterion incorporating unique elements from the search process. The quality of the included articles was assessed utilizing Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT). When reviewer discrepancies arose, authors reread full-text studies and discussed the inclusion and exclusion criteria to achieve consensus. RESULTS: The data searches identified 8,979 articles, with 239 articles remaining after duplicates and nonapplicable articles were removed.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Anxiety is common in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and is associated with an increased risk for adverse outcomes. There has been a relative paucity of studies concerning treatment of anxiety in patients with CHD. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review to organize and assess research into the treatment of anxiety in patients with CHD. METHODS: We searched CCTR/CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL for randomized clinical trials conducted before October 2016 that measured anxiety before and after an intervention for patients with CHD. RESULTS: A total of 475 articles were subjected to full text review, yielding 112 publications that met inclusion criteria plus an additional 7 studies from reference lists and published reviews, yielding 119 studies. Sample size, country of origin, study quality, and demographics varied widely among studies. Most studies were conducted with nonanxious patients. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were the most frequently used instruments to assess anxiety. Interventions included pharmacological, counseling, relaxation-based, educational, or ""alternative"" therapies. Forty (33% of total) studies reported that the interventions reduced anxiety; treatment efficacy varied by study and type of intervention. Elevated anxiety was an inclusion criterion in only 4 studies, with inconsistent results. CONCLUSION: Although there have been a number of randomized clinical trials of patients with CHD that assessed anxiety, in most cases anxiety was a secondary outcome, and only one-third found that symptoms of anxiety were reduced with treatment. Future studies need to target anxious patients and evaluate the effects of treatment on anxiety and relevant clinical endpoints.",research

Abstract: Anxiety disorders are disorders involving cognition. Research on cognition in youth with anxiety can focus on cognitive content (e.g., self-talk) as well cognitive functioning. The present review examines domains of cognitive functioning (i.e., episodic memory, language, attention, executive functioning, motor skills, and visual functioning) in youth diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. A database search of Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed yielded 28 studies that met inclusion criteria of youth aged 17 years or younger, a sample diagnosed with a principal anxiety disorder and a comparison sample of controls, a comparison between those samples, and use of a behavioral measure of neuropsychological performance. Findings did not identify any cognitive functioning strengths for anxious youth. Deficits were found in two domains (i.e., receptive language and motor skills) whereas no deficits were found in attention, visuospatial skills and one domain of executive functioning (i.e., inhibition). Most domains had mixed findings. Additional analysis indicated that anxiety disorders in youth are not associated with diminished IQ. Directions for future research are identified including (a) the prioritization of studies with larger, representative samples (b) the role of cognitive functioning as a predictor of anxiety treatment outcome (c) the examination of the effect of treatment on cognitive performance, and (d) the course of anxiety and potential impairment in cognitive functioning.",research

Published: Sep 2019

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Previous studies indicate that early symptomatic improvement, typically observed during the first 4 weeks of psychological therapy, is associated with positive treatment outcomes for a range of mental health problems. However, the replicability, statistical significance, and magnitude of this association remain unclear. AIM: The current study reviewed the literature on early response to psychological interventions for adults with depression and anxiety symptoms. METHODS: A systematic review and random effects meta-analysis were conducted, including studies found in Medline, PsychINFO, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and through reference lists and reverse citations. RESULTS: Twenty-five eligible studies including 11,091 patients measured early response and examined associations with posttreatment outcomes. It was possible to extract and/or calculate effect size data from 15 studies to conduct a meta-analysis. A large pooled effect size (g = 0.87 [95% confidence interval: 0.63-1.10], p < .0001) indicated that early responders had significantly better posttreatment outcomes compared to cases without early response, and this effect was larger in anxiety (g = 1.37) compared to depression (g = 0.76) measures. Most studies were of good quality and there was no evidence of publication bias. The main limitations concerned insufficient statistical reporting in some studies, which precluded their inclusion in meta-analysis, and it was not possible to examine effect sizes according to different outcome questionnaires. CONCLUSION: There is robust and replicated evidence that early response to therapy is a reliable prognostic indicator for depression and anxiety treatment outcomes.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and can affect disease outcomes, including quality of life and success of disease treatment. Successful management of psychiatric comorbidities may improve outcomes, though the effectiveness of existing treatments in IBD is unknown. METHODS: We searched multiple online databases from inception until March 25, 2015, without restrictions on language, date, or location of publication. We included controlled clinical trials conducted in persons with IBD and depression or anxiety. Two independent reviewers reviewed all abstracts and full-text articles and extracted information including trial and participant characteristics. We also assessed the risk of bias. RESULTS: Of 768 unique abstracts, we included one trial of pharmacological anxiety treatment in IBD (48 participants), which found an improvement in anxiety symptoms (p < 0.001). There was a high risk of bias in this trial. We found no controlled clinical trials on the treatment of depression in persons with IBD and depression and no controlled clinical trials reporting on psychological interventions for anxiety or depression in IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Only one trial examined an intervention for anxiety in adults with IBD and no trials studied depression in adults with IBD.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM: Depression and anxiety can cause social, behavioral, occupational, and functional impairments if not controlled and managed. Mobile-based self-care applications can play an essential and effective role in controlling and reducing the effects of anxiety disorders and depression. The aim of this study was to design and develop a mobile-based self-care application for patients with depression and anxiety disorders with the goal of enhancing their mental health and overall well-being. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study we designed a mobile-based application for self -management of depression and anxiety disorders. In order to design this application, first the education- informational needs and capabilities were identified through a systematic review. Then, according to 20 patients with depression and anxiety, this education-informational needs and application capabilities were approved. In the next step, the application was designed. RESULTS: In the first step, 80 education-information needs and capabilities were identified. Finally, in the second step, of 80 education- informational needs and capabilities, 68 needs and capabilities with a mean greater than and equal to 3.75 (75%) were considered in application design. Disease control and management, drug management, nutrition and diet management, recording clinical records, communicating with physicians and other patients, reminding appointments, how to improve lifestyle, quitting smoking and reducing alcohol consumption, educational content, sedation instructions, introducing health care centers for depression and anxiety treatment and recording activities, personal goals and habits in a diary were the most important features of this application.",research

Abstract: Pre-injury anxiety disorder may be a risk factor for poor outcomes following sportsrelated concussion. A systematic review was performed to characterize the relationship between pre-injury anxiety disorder and post-concussion symptom presentation and recovery time after sports-related concussions among children, adolescents, and young adults. A PRISMA-compliant literature search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and Scopus for articles published up to 25 January 2024. The initial query yielded 1358 unique articles. Articles that analyzed the relationship between pre-injury anxiety disorder and post-concussion symptoms and recovery time were included. A final cohort of 11 articles was extracted, comprising a total of 8390 study participants, of whom 921 had a history of pre-injury anxiety disorder. Pre-injury anxiety disorder was associated with prolonged time to return to sports activity and an increased incidence of physical, emotional, cognitive, and sleep-related symptoms. While the results of this review suggest an association between pre-injury anxiety disorder and post-concussion symptoms and recovery time, future studies should be more stringent regarding standardized anxiety disorder definitions, longitudinal assessment of post-concussion symptoms, anxiety disorder subtypes, and anxiety treatment history.",research

Abstract: Mental health is a global public concern that contributes raising disability and premature death. Anxiety undertakes around 3.6% of the global population, while psychological stress is a condition associated to anxiety with a prevalence of 36.5%. Treatment for both mental conditions consist mainly of psychological therapy and pharmacotherapy, but the long-term drugs use can trigger adverse effects. Growing evidence shows the effect of specific food compounds on stress and anxiety treatment. The aim of this systematic review is to describe the molecular mechanisms related to dietary polyphenols administration from food matrix (considering food, juices or herbal/food extracts) and their effects on stress and/or anxiety, as well as review the available clinical evidence. Search was based on PRISMA Guidelines using peer-reviewed journal articles sourced from PubMed and Web of Science. A total of 38 articles were considered as eligible. The major effects for anxiety management were: reduction of oxidative stress and inflammation; HPA axis modulation; and regulation of some serotonergic/adrenergic pathways. There is a very limited evidence to conclude about the real effect of dietary polyphenols on stress. Although pharmacological treatment for mood disorders is essential, alternative therapies are necessary using non-pharmacological compounds to improve the long-term treatment effectiveness.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are the most common mental disorders worldwide. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to review silymarin and silibinin effects and underlying mechanisms in the central nervous system (CNS) for depression and anxiety treatment. METHODS: The research protocol was prepared based on following the PRISMA statement. An extensive search was done in essential databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science (ISI), Embase, and Scopus. Considering the study inclusion and exclusion criteria, 17 studies were finally included. The desired information was extracted from the studies and recorded in Excel, and the consequences and mechanisms were reviewed. RESULTS: Silymarin and silibinin upregulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and improved neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferation in the cortex and hippocampus. They also increased neurochemical serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE) levels. Silymarin and silibinin reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) formation and increased glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities. In addition, silymarin and silibinin reduced interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and IL-12β, reducing tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) induced neuroinflammation. CONCLUSION: Silymarin and silibinin exert anti-depression and anxiolytic effects by regulating neurotransmitters, endocrine, neurogenesis, and immunologic systems. Therefore, as natural and complementary medicines, they can be used to reduce the symptoms of depression and anxiety; However, more clinical studies are needed in this field.",research

Abstract: Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental health issues in childhood, yet most children do not receive treatment. With recent advances in technology, a growing number of digital anxiety interventions are becoming accessible. This study is the first meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of digital cognitive-behavioral anxiety interventions for individuals under the age of 18. Five electronic databases (PsycNET, Web of Science, Science Direct, Pub Med, SAGE Journals.) were systematically searched in 2021. Inclusion criteria were: randomized control trials with a wait list no treatment control, standalone to blended care with minimal therapist involvement, diagnosed anxiety disorder or elevated levels of anxiety, outcome anxiety levels had to be assessed by a clinician, or the patients themselves by a validated anxiety measure. We assessed and controlled for publication bias, and considered the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Eighteen studies were found eligible, which examined 1290 participants in total. Pooled effect sizes using a random-effects model yielded low overall effect for self-ratings (g = 0.28, k = 18, p < 0.001, 95% CI [0.14; 0.41]), and medium effect for ratings of clinicians (g = 0.66, k = 13, p < 0.001, 95% CI [0.50; 0.80]) as well as for parental report (g = 0.49, k = 16, p < 0.001, 95% CI [0.29; 0.69]). We found that the effects were homogenous across studies. Further examining potential moderating factors of treatment efficacy is needed in future research, as well as conducting studies that compare traditional methods of care to their digital counterparts.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study examined the extent to which social anxiety treatment studies report the demographic characteristics of their participants. One hundred and 56 treatment studies published in English between 2001 and 2012 articles were collected. METHODS: Each study was evaluated on whether or not it reported information on gender, age, race, relationship status, education, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, and disability and also the extent to which the racial composition of the sample was described. RESULTS: The majority of studies reported information on age (96.2%) and gender (94.2%), but the percentage of studies that reported anything else is much lower: race (50.0%), education (42.3%), relationship status (37.8%), socioeconomic status (5.1%), disability (2.6%), and sexual orientation (1.3%). One third (34.0%) of studies reported the race of all participants in their samples, while the remaining reported no information or information for only a subset of participants (e.g. ""mostly white""). CONCLUSIONS: Participants of social anxiety disorder treatment studies generally are not described beyond their age and gender. Standards for reporting participant characteristics of treatment studies (similar to standards for reporting the methodology of treatment studies) could improve clinical researchers' and clinicians' ability to evaluate the external validity of this body of work.",research

Abstract: With the advent of human neuroimaging, researchers were drawn to the idea that by better understanding the human brain, more effective mental health interventions could be developed. It has been more than 20 years since the first functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies were conducted to examine changes in brain activation with anxiety-related treatments and more than 60 studies have since been published in this vein. For the current review, we conduct a systematic review of this literature, focusing on adult studies using task-based fMRI to measure brain activation changes with pharmacologic or psychotherapy interventions for phobia, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Neuroscientific theories of anxiety-related disorders and their treatment have focused on prefrontal-insula-amygdala networks. Treatment-related decreases in amygdala and/or anterior insula activation were identified as the most consistent finding across disorders, with the most consistent results reported for specific phobia. Directionality of change and specific regions implicated in the prefrontal cortex were inconsistent across studies. The potential importance for probing other networks and processes as mechanisms of anxiety treatment was recognized, such as striatal regions underlying inhibitory learning or reward responsivity. Future treatment-fMRI research related to anxiety disorders would benefit from larger sample sizes, use of more nuanced computational approaches, and increased focus on replication.",research

Authors: Sarah M Schippers, Christina Hajewski, Natalie A Glass et al. Published: 2018

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to systematically review available literature reporting vessel patency and how this correlates with cold symptoms following the treatment of a single forearm artery injury when the hand remains perfused. The outcomes of those treated by ligation were compared to those treated with vessel repair. METHODS: Electronic databases including PubMed, Embase (Elsevier) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Willey) were searched for studies that reported the outcomes of patients who underwent either ligation or repair of single vessel injuries to hands that remained perfused at time of presentation. Level of evidence was determined by two independent reviewers. Studies were then sorted based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and application of inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 19 studies were included for statistical analysis. The patency of repaired vessels was calculated (with comparison between those with radial versus ulnar repair) as was the prevalence of cold symptoms in both ligation (or repairs that went on to occlusion) and repair groups. RESULTS: The average patency of radial and ulnar artery repairs was 68.39% and 65.56% respectively. There was no significant difference between the success rates of these repair groups (pooled estimates for odd ratios was 1.02, p=0.867). The average incidence of cold symptoms in those who underwent ligation (or repair that when on to occlusion) and those that had patent repairs were 19.82% and 17.27% respectively. There was no significant difference between the incidence of cold symptoms between these groups (pooled estimate for proportion of patients with cold symptoms was 0.223, p=0.573).",research

There was also no significant difference in the prevalence of cold sensitivity in patients who underwent vessel ligation compared to those who underwent repair (and subsequently remained patent). These results support the conclusion of there being no clear benefit to attempting repair of a single vessel, although further studies are needed given the often incomplete reporting of clinical outcomes in this patient population. Additionally, though a cost-benefit analysis was not included in this review, exploring this aspect of the decision making process could be valuable.Level of Evidence: IV.",research

Authors: Sterre van der Ziel, Elske Hogendoorn, Brian A Jorge et al. Published: Mar 2025

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Young children frequently experience physical symptoms, such as common cold, vaccination pain or a playground injury. Picture books about physical symptoms and illness are a source of information for young children. This study assessed the nature and causes of and responses to physical symptoms depicted in Dutch children's picture books. METHODS: A systematic search for Dutch picture books for children between the ages of 2 and 8 years about physical symptoms or illness was conducted in public library catalogues in the Netherlands, with terms such as 'pain' and 'doctor'. Only picture books with a fictional storyline, in which the main character experienced symptoms or illness, were included. A content analysis was conducted by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: Fifty-five books met the inclusion criteria. The most common symptoms were injuries (29%), cold symptoms (21%), fatigue/malaise (14%) and fever (11%). Causes were mostly unknown (41%), due to accidents (38%) or infections (18%). Accidents were always caused by the main character. In 89% of the picture books, remedies were necessary to resolve the symptoms, including bandages (36%), bedrest (33%), medical interventions (33%) or medication (27%). Fifty-six percent of the books depicted seeking medical care. Four themes regarding the morals of the stories were identified: the seemingly scary hospital or doctor, the responsibility of the main character to engage in coping strategies, the importance of social contacts, and illness gains after possible unpleasantness of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The picture books about physical symptoms and illness in our sample depicted various symptoms, limited causes and a range of responses.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) impact all age groups and have a significant economic and social burden on society, worldwide. Most URTIs are mild and self-limiting, but due to the wide range of possible causative agents, including Rhinovirus (hRV), Adenovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Coronavirus and Influenza, there is no single and effective treatment. Over-the-counter (OTC) remedies, including traditional medicines and those containing plant derived substances, help to alleviate symptoms including inflammation, pain, fever and cough. PURPOSE: This systematic review focuses on the role of the major plant derived substances in several OTC remedies used to treat cold symptoms, with a particular focus on the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels involved in pain and cough. METHODS: Literature searches were done using Pubmed and Web of Science, with no date limitations, using the principles of the PRISMA statement. The search terms used were 'TRP channel AND plant compound', 'cough AND plant compound', 'cough AND TRP channels AND plant compound', 'cough AND P2X3 AND plant compound' and 'P2X3 AND plant compound' where plant compound represents menthol or camphor or eucalyptus or turpentine or thymol. RESULTS: The literature reviewed showed that menthol activates TRPM8 and may inhibit respiratory reflexes reducing irritation and cough. Menthol has a bimodal action on TRPA1, but inhibition may have an analgesic effect. Eucalyptus also activates TRPM8 and inhibits TRPA1 whilst down regulating P2X3, aiding in the reduction of cough, pain and airway irritation. Camphor inhibits TRPA1 and the activation of TRPM8 may add to the effects of menthol.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are standardized questionnaires for the assessment of health outcomes directly from the patient. A systematic evaluation of the quality of PROMs for acute bronchitis (AB) and acute cough due to (lower) respiratory tract infection or common cold has not yet been performed. The present study aimed to systematically review the quality of available PROMs for AB and acute cough due to (lower) respiratory tract infection or common cold for use in adults and children. METHODOLOGY: Embase, PubMed and Web of Science were searched for studies reporting on the development and/or validation of any PROMs for AB and acute cough due to (lower) respiratory tract infection or common cold. We assessed the methodological quality of each included study, evaluated the quality of measurement properties per PROM and study, and graded the evidence according to the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) methodology. Based on the overall evidence, we derived recommendations for use of the instruments. RESULTS: We included three studies on three PROMs for adults measuring disease severity (Acute Bronchitis Severity Score (ABSS); Symptom Diary) and cough-related quality of life (Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ-acute)). For children, we included two studies on two PROMs assessing quality of life (Parent-proxy Children's Acute Cough-specific QoL Questionnaire (PAC-QoL CONCLUSIONS: None of the identified PROMs can be unrestrictedly recommended for use in future research. For adults, the LCQ-acute appears the most suitable tool warranting further validation.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Since there is still no definitive conclusion regarding which non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are most effective and safe in viral respiratory infections, we decided to evaluate the efficacy and safety of various NSAIDs in viral respiratory infections so that we can reach a conclusion on which NSAID is best choice for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A search was performed in Medline (via PubMed), Embase and CENTRAL databases until 23 March 2020. Clinical trials on application of NSAIDs in viral respiratory infections were included. RESULTS: Six clinical trials were included. No clinical trial has been performed on COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome infections. Studies show that ibuprofen and naproxen not only have positive effects in controlling cold symptoms, but also do not cause serious side effects in rhinovirus infections. In addition, it was found that clarithromycin, naproxen and oseltamivir combination leads to decrease in mortality rate and duration of hospitalisation in patients with pneumonia caused by influenza. CONCLUSION: Although based on existing evidence, NSAIDs have been effective in treating respiratory infections caused by influenza and rhinovirus, since there is no clinical trial on COVID-19 and case-reports and clinical experiences are indicative of elongation of treatment duration and exacerbation of the clinical course of patients with COVID-19, it is recommended to use substitutes such as acetaminophen for controlling fever and inflammation and be cautious about using NSAIDs in management of COVID-19 patients until there are enough evidence. Naproxen may be a good choice for future clinical trials.",research
