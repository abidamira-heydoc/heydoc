The uterus, or womb, is the place where a fetus grows during pregnancy . In an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg grows in the wrong place outside the uterus. It usually occurs in the fallopian tubes. These tubes carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus. Sometimes, an ectopic pregnancy can occur in the ovaries, abdominal cavity, or the lower part of the uterus (cervix). Ectopic pregnancies can't end in a healthy pregnancy because the egg cannot grow.

Some birth defects like cleft lip or neural tube defects are structural problems that can be easy to see. Others, like heart disease , are found using special tests. Birth defects can range from mild to severe. How a birth defect affects a child's life depends mostly on which organ or body part is involved and how severe the defect is. What causes birth defects? For some birth defects, researchers know the cause. But for many birth defects, the exact cause is unknown. Researchers think that most birth defects are caused by a complex mix of factors, which can include: Genetics. One or more genes might have a change or mutation that prevents them from working properly. For example, this happens in Fragile X syndrome . With some defects, a gene or part of the gene might be missing. Chromosomal problems. In some cases, a chromosome or part of a chromosome might be missing. This is what happens in Turner syndrome . In other cases, such as with Down syndrome , the child has an extra chromosome. Exposures to medicines , chemicals, or other toxic substances . For example, alcohol misuse can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders . Infections during pregnancy .

HIV harms your immune system by destroying a type of white blood cell that helps your body fight infection. This puts you at risk for other infections and diseases. What is AIDS? AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. It happens when the body's immune system is badly damaged because of the virus. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS. How does HIV spread? HIV is spread through certain body fluids from a person who has HIV. This can happen: By having unprotected vaginal or anal sex with a person who has HIV. ""Unprotected"" means not using condoms or medicine to treat or prevent HIV. This is the most common way that it spreads. By sharing drug needles. Through contact with the blood of a person with HIV. From mother to fetus during pregnancy . From mother to baby during, childbirth, or breastfeeding. Who is at risk for HIV infection? Anyone can get HIV, but certain groups have a higher risk of getting it: People who have another sexually transmitted infection (STI). Having an STI can increase your risk of getting or spreading HIV. People who inject drugs with shared needles. Gay and bisexual men. Black/African Americans and Hispanic/Latino Americans. They make up a higher proportion of new HIV diagnoses and people with HIV, compared to other races and ethnicities. People who engage in risky sexual behaviors, such as not using condoms or medicine to prevent or treat HIV. Factors such as stigma, discrimination, income, education, and geographic region can also affect people's risk for HIV. What are the symptoms of HIV? The first signs of HIV infection may be flu-like symptoms: Fever Chills Rash Night sweats (heavy sweating during sleep) Muscle aches Sore throat Fatigue Swollen lymph nodes Mouth ulcers These symptoms may come and go within two to four weeks. This stage is called acute HIV infection.",condition

Often, there are no symptoms during this stage. If it is not treated, eventually the virus will weaken your body's immune system. Then the infection will progress to AIDS. This is the late stage of HIV infection. Because your immune system is badly damaged, your body cannot fight off other infections, called opportunistic infections (OIs). OIs are infections that happen more frequently or are more severe in people who have weakened immune systems. Some people may not feel sick during the earlier stages of HIV infection. So the only way to know for sure whether you have HIV is to get tested. How do I know if I have HIV? A blood test can tell if you have HIV infection. Your health care provider can do the test, or you can use a home testing kit. You can also use the CDC Testing Locator to find free testing sites. What are the treatments for HIV? There is no cure for HIV infection, but it can be treated with medicines. This is called antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART can make HIV infection a manageable chronic condition. It also reduces the risk of spreading the virus to others. Most people with HIV live long and healthy lives if they get ART as soon as possible and stay on it. It's also important to take care of yourself. Making sure that you have the support you need, living a healthy lifestyle, and getting regular medical care can help you enjoy a better quality of life . Can HIV infection be prevented? You can reduce the risk of getting or spreading HIV by: Getting tested for HIV. Choosing less risky sexual behaviors. This includes limiting the number of sexual partners you have and using latex condoms every time you have sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.

Growth disorders are problems that prevent children from developing normal height, weight, sexual maturity or other features. Very slow or very fast growth can sometimes signal a gland problem or disease. The pituitary gland makes growth hormone, which stimulates the growth of bone and other tissues. Children who have too little of it may be very short. Treatment with growth hormone can stimulate growth. People can also have too much growth hormone. Usually the cause is a pituitary gland tumor, which is not cancer. Too much growth hormone can cause gigantism in children, where their bones and their body grow too much.

It secretes digestive juices into the small intestine through a tube called the pancreatic duct. The pancreas also releases the hormones insulin and glucagon into the bloodstream. Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. It happens when digestive enzymes start digesting the pancreas itself. Pancreatitis can be acute or chronic. Either form is serious and can lead to complications. Acute pancreatitis occurs suddenly and usually goes away in a few days with treatment. It is often caused by gallstones . Common symptoms are severe pain in the upper abdomen, nausea, and vomiting. Treatment is usually a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and medicines to relieve pain. Chronic pancreatitis does not heal or improve. It gets worse over time and leads to permanent damage. The most common cause is heavy alcohol use . Other causes include cystic fibrosis and other inherited disorders, high levels of calcium or fats in the blood, some medicines, and autoimmune conditions . Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and oily stools. Treatment may also be a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids, medicines to relieve pain, and nutritional support.

Respiratory failure is a condition in which your blood doesn't have enough oxygen or has too much carbon dioxide. Sometimes you can have both problems. When you breathe, your lungs take in oxygen. The oxygen passes into your blood, which carries it to your organs. Your organs, such as your heart and brain, need this oxygen-rich blood to work well. Another part of breathing is removing the carbon dioxide from the blood and breathing it out. Having too much carbon dioxide in your blood can harm your organs. What causes respiratory failure? Conditions that affect your breathing can cause respiratory failure. These conditions may affect the muscles, nerves, bones, or tissues that support breathing. Or they may affect the lungs directly. These conditions include: Diseases that affect the lungs , such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), cystic fibrosis , pneumonia , pulmonary embolism , and COVID-19 Conditions that affect the nerves and muscles that control breathing, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), muscular dystrophy , spinal cord injuries , and stroke Problems with the spine, such as scoliosis (a curve in the spine). They can affect the bones and muscles used for breathing. Damage to the tissues and ribs around the lungs. An injury to the chest can cause this damage. Drug or alcohol overdose Inhalation injuries , such as from inhaling smoke (from fires) or harmful fumes What are the symptoms of respiratory failure? The symptoms of respiratory failure depend on the cause and the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood. A low oxygen level in the blood can cause shortness of breath and air hunger (the feeling that you can't breathe in enough air). Your skin, lips, and fingernails may also have a bluish color. A high carbon dioxide level can cause rapid breathing and confusion. Some people who have respiratory failure may become very sleepy or lose consciousness.",condition

Your health care provider will diagnose respiratory failure based on: Your medical history A physical exam, which often includes Listening to your lungs to check for abnormal sounds Listening to your heart to check for arrhythmia Looking for a bluish color on your skin, lips, and fingernails Diagnostic tests, such as Pulse oximetry, a small sensor that uses a light to measure how much oxygen is in your blood. The sensor goes on the end of your finger or on your ear. Arterial blood gas test, a test that measures the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in your blood. The blood sample is taken from an artery, usually in your wrist. Once you are diagnosed with respiratory failure, your provider will look for what is causing it. Tests for this often include a chest x-ray. If your provider thinks you may have arrhythmia because of the respiratory failure, you may have an EKG (electrocardiogram). This is simple, painless test that detects and records your heart's electrical activity. What are the treatments for respiratory failure? Treatment for respiratory failure depends on: Whether it is acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing) How severe it is What is causing it Acute respiratory failure can be a medical emergency. You may need treatment in intensive care unit at a hospital. Chronic respiratory failure can often be treated at home.

All of these hormones do many important jobs, including: Turning food into energy and managing blood sugar levels Balancing salt and water Keeping blood pressure normal Responding to illness and stress (your ""fight or flight"" response) Timing when and how fast a child develops sexually Supporting pregnancy What are adrenal gland disorders? When you have an adrenal gland disorder, your body makes too much or too little of one or more hormones. The symptoms depend on the type of problem you have and how much it affects the hormone levels in your body. There are many types of adrenal gland disorders, including: Addison's Disease - a condition in which the adrenal glands don't make enough cortisol Cushing's Syndrome - a condition caused by too much cortisol in the body, often from taking steroid medicines for a long time Aldosterone-producing adenoma - a benign tumor (not cancer) that makes too much aldosterone and may cause serious high blood pressure Hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma - an inherited condition causing different types of tumors that make adrenaline and other hormones. Some tumors may become cancerous. Adrenal gland cancer - cancerous tumors, including adrenocortical carcinoma and neuroblastoma Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) - a group of inherited disorders in which the adrenal glands don't make enough cortisol. The most common type is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (also called CAH1) . In the United States, newborn babies get a blood test to see if they have CAH.",condition

Changes in genes (mutations). These changes can cause the adrenal glands to make too much or too little of one or more hormones. Infections In many cases the cause of the problem isn't clear. How are adrenal gland disorders diagnosed? Health care providers use different tests to check for adrenal disorders depending on your symptoms and health history. For example, you may have tests of your blood, urine (pee), or saliva (spit). These tests check your hormone levels. Your provider may order x-rays , CT scans , or MRI scans to look for tumors.

Leukodystrophies are a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS is made up of your brain and spinal cord. Leukodystrophies damage the white matter of your CNS. The white matter includes: Nerve fibers, also called axons, which connect your nerve cells Myelin, a layer of proteins and fatty materials that covers and protects the nerve fibers. It also helps speed up signals between the nerve cells. When the white matter is damaged, it can slow down or block the signals between nerve cells. This can cause many different symptoms, including trouble with movement , vision , hearing , and thinking. There are over 50 types of leukodystrophies. Some types are present at birth, while others may not cause symptoms until a child becomes a toddler. A few types mainly affect adults. Most types get worse over time. What causes leukodystrophies? Leukodystrophies are caused by genetic changes. These changes are usually inherited, meaning that they are passed from parent to child. What are the symptoms of leukodystrophies? The symptoms of leukodystrophies depend on the type; they can include a gradual loss of: Muscle tone Balance and mobility Walking Speech Ability to eat Vision Hearing Behavior There can also be other symptoms, such as: Learning disabilities Bladder issues Breathing problems Developmental disabilities Muscle control disorders Seizures How are leukodystrophies diagnosed?

Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. For example, there are vaccines to protect against diseases caused by: Viruses , like the ones that cause the flu and COVID-19 Bacteria , including tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis What are the types of vaccines? There are several types of vaccines: Live-attenuated vaccines use a weakened form of the germ. Inactivated vaccines use a killed version of the germ. Subunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines use only specific pieces of the germ, such as its protein, sugar, or casing. Toxoid vaccines use a toxin (harmful product) made by the germ. mRNA vaccines use messenger RNA, which gives your cells instructions for how to make a protein (or piece of a protein) of the germ. Viral vector vaccines use genetic material, which gives your cells instructions for making a protein of the germ. These vaccines also contain a different, harmless virus that helps get the genetic material into your cells. These vaccines may work in different ways, but they all spark an immune response. The immune response is the way your body defends itself against substances it sees as foreign or harmful. These substances include germs that can cause disease. What happens in an immune response? There are different steps in the immune response: When a germ invades, your body sees it as foreign. Your immune system helps your body fight off the germ. Your immune system also remembers the germ. It will attack the germ if it ever invades again. This ""memory"" protects you against the disease that the germ causes. This type of protection is called immunity. What are immunization and vaccination? Immunization is the process of becoming protected against a disease. But it can also mean the same thing as vaccination, which is getting a vaccine to become protected against a disease. Why are vaccines important?",condition
medlineplus_0056_2,Vaccines,MedlinePlus,https://medlineplus.gov/vaccines.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Vaccines are important because they protect you against many diseases. These diseases can be very serious. So getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease. For a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would. But vaccines don't just protect you. They also protect the people around you through community immunity. What is community immunity? Community immunity, or herd immunity, is the idea that vaccines can help keep communities healthy. Normally, germs can travel quickly through a community and make a lot of people sick. If enough people get sick, it can lead to an outbreak. But when enough people are vaccinated against a certain disease, it's harder for that disease to spread to others. This type of protection means that the entire community is less likely to get the disease. Community immunity is especially important for people who can't get certain vaccines. For example, they may not be able to get a vaccine because they have weakened immune systems. Others may be allergic to certain vaccine ingredients. And newborn babies are too young to get some vaccines. Community immunity can help to protect them all. Are vaccines safe? Vaccines are safe . They must go through extensive safety testing and evaluation before they are approved in the United States. What is a vaccine schedule? A vaccine, or immunization, schedule lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. It includes who should get the vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes the vaccine schedule. It's important for both children and adults to get their vaccines according to the schedule.

To infect a cell, HIV has to bind to two types of molecules on the cell's surface. Blocking either of these molecules prevents HIV from entering the cells. Attachment inhibitors bind to a specific protein on the outer surface of HIV. This prevents HIV from entering the cell. Pharmacokinetic enhancers are another type of medicine. They are sometimes taken along with certain other HIV medicines. Pharmacokinetic enhancers increase the effectiveness of the other medicine. They work by slowing the breakdown of the other medicine. This allows that medicine to stay in the body longer at a higher concentration. There are also multidrug combinations , which include a combination of two or more different types of HIV medicines.

NAFLD is a type of fatty liver disease that is not related to heavy alcohol use. There are two kinds: Simple fatty liver, in which you have fat in your liver but little or no inflammation or liver cell damage. Simple fatty liver typically does not get bad enough to cause liver damage or complications. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), in which you have inflammation and liver cell damage, as well as fat in your liver. Inflammation and liver cell damage can cause fibrosis, or scarring, of the liver. NASH may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer . What is alcoholic fatty liver disease?

But if you have a food allergy, your immune system mistakenly reacts to certain foods as if they were harmful. This reaction is usually mild. But in some cases, it can be serious or even life-threatening. A food intolerance is different than a food allergy. If you have a food intolerance, you also have symptoms when you eat that food. But these are typically just digestive symptoms such as bloating and gas . Also, an intolerance is not an immune system reaction. Most food allergies are caused by: Cow's milk Chicken eggs Crustacean shellfish, such as shrimp, crab, lobster, and crayfish Fish Peanuts Sesame Soy Tree nuts, such as almonds, walnuts, pecans Wheat People with a food allergy may be allergic to more than one type of food. Who is more likely to develop a food allergy? Both children and adults can have food allergies. Some children will outgrow their food allergies. And sometimes people can develop food allergies as adult. Certain factors can make you more likely to have a food allergy. They include: Having eczema , a disease that causes inflammation, redness, and irritation of the skin. Your immune system also plays a role in eczema. Having asthma or other allergies , such as hay fever . Your genes. Certain genes may influence the development of food allergies. And you are more likely to have food allergies if someone in your family has allergies, asthma, or eczema. What are the symptoms of food allergies? If you are allergic to a food you have eaten, you may have a variety of symptoms. These symptoms are not always the same for every person.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency, or AATD) is an inherited condition that raises your risk for lung and liver disease. If you have this condition, your body doesn't make enough alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). AAT is made by your liver. It helps protect your lungs from inflammation and irritating substances you might breathe in, such as smoke. If your liver doesn't make enough AAT, your lungs may be more easily damaged from smoking , pollution , or dust from the environment. This can lead to a serious lung condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ). AAT deficiency may also cause a liver disease called cirrhosis . This is more common in children who have AAT deficiency. What causes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency)? AAT deficiency is a genetic disorder . That means it's caused by changes in your genes, which may also be called gene variants or mutations. Your genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. AAT deficiency is caused by changes in the SERPINA1 gene , which carries instructions for making the AAT protein. These gene changes are inherited from your parents, so AAT deficiency tends to run in families: If you have two mutated copies of the gene, it means you have a condition called AAT deficiency. People with this disorder have a higher risk of getting lung disease or liver damage before the age of 45. If you have one mutated copy of the gene, you are a carrier of AAT deficiency. In these cases, this means you are at slightly higher risk of developing lung disease, especially if you have other risk factors, such as being a smoker. You could still pass the mutated gene on to your children. There are a few gene changes that cause AAT deficiency. These gene changes can: Decrease the amount of AAT protein your liver makes. Prevent your liver from making any AAT.",condition

Anesthesia is the use of medicines, called anesthetics, to prevent pain during surgery and other medical procedures. Medicine may be given by injection, inhalation, topical lotion, spray, eye drops, or a skin patch. Anesthesia can cause a loss of feeling, awareness, or both. Sedation may be used with anesthesia. Unlike full anesthesia, sedation doesn't make you completely unconscious, and recovery is faster. It helps reduce pain, keep you calm, and make you less aware during procedures such as minor surgeries, endoscopies , imaging , or dental work. Levels of sedation include: Minimal sedation. You are awake but more relaxed. Moderate sedation (conscious sedation). You may feel sleepy and not remember much, but you can still respond when spoken to or touched. Deep sedation. You are very drowsy and may respond only to repeated or stronger stimulation. What is anesthesia used for? Anesthesia may be used for: Minor procedures, such as filling a tooth. Childbirth or procedures such as colonoscopies . Minor and major surgeries. In some cases, a dentist, nurse, or doctor may give you an anesthetic. In other cases, you may need an anesthesiologist. This is a doctor who specializes in giving anesthesia. What are the types of anesthesia? There are several different types of anesthesia: Local anesthesia numbs a small area like a tooth or a cut that needs stitches. You are awake during local anesthesia. Regional anesthesia numbs a larger area, like an arm, a leg, or everything below the waist. You may be awake during the procedure, or you may be given sedation. It may be used during childbirth, a Cesarean delivery (C-section), or minor surgeries. General anesthesia affects your whole body. It feels like a deep sleep, but you do not feel anything.

Angioplasty is a procedure to improve blood flow in coronary arteries that have become narrow or blocked. Your coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart. If you have coronary artery disease , a sticky material called plaque builds up in your coronary arteries. Plaque is made of cholesterol , calcium, and other substances in your blood. Over time, it can narrow your arteries or fully block them. When this happens, some parts of your heart don't get enough blood. Angioplasty widens the blocked part of your artery so more blood can get through. It is also called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). What conditions does angioplasty treat? Doctors (usually a heart specialist called a cardiologist) use angioplasty to: Reduce chest pain from blockages in the coronary arteries. This type of pain is called angina . There are different types of angina. Angioplasty treats certain types. Limit damage to the heart during or right after a heart attack . In this case, angioplasty is an emergency treatment. Angioplasty does not cure coronary artery disease. To help prevent more plaque blockages , you'll need to take any prescribed medicines, eat healthy foods, and get regular exercise . What happens during angioplasty? Most people have angioplasties in a hospital in a special room called a cardiac catheterization, or cath, lab. You will be awake and lying down. You'll get medicine to help you relax through an intravenous (IV) line. This is a small tube that goes into a vein in your hand or arm. Angioplasty is done through a blood vessel in your arm, wrist, or groin. Your doctor will: Make a small opening in that area to insert a thin tube (a catheter) into a blood vessel. Thread the tube through the vessel to your heart, using x-rays as a guide. Inject contrast dye inside your arteries. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the x-rays.

This makes the artery wider and improves blood flow. Sometimes put a small, mesh tube into the artery to help keep it open. The tube is called a stent. Some stents have a coating of medicine that helps prevent blood clots from forming. What happens after an angioplasty? If you had an angioplasty for chest pain, you'll go to a recovery room for a few hours. You may stay in the hospital overnight. Your doctor will probably prescribe medicines to prevent blood clots . Most people can return to their usual activities after a week. If you had an emergency angioplasty for a heart attack, you'll need to stay in the hospital for about a few more days. Are there any risks from angioplasty? Angioplasty is very safe, but every invasive procedure comes with risks. You may get a bruise , feel sore, or have some bleeding where the tubes were inserted.

Healthy lifestyle changes can help reduce high blood pressure: Losing weight Being physically active Managing stress Reducing sodium in your diet Avoiding alcohol , tobacco , and illegal drugs Getting enough sleep What if lifestyle changes alone cannot lower blood pressure? Sometimes lifestyle changes alone cannot control or lower your high blood pressure. In that case, your health care provider may prescribe blood pressure medicines. How do blood pressure medicines work? The most commonly used blood pressure medicines work in different ways to lower blood pressure: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) keep your blood vessels from narrowing as much and allows blood to move through them with less pressure. Beta blockers help your heart beat slower and with less force. This means that your heart pumps less blood through your blood vessels. Beta blockers are typically used only as a backup option or if you also have certain other conditions. Calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows the blood vessels to relax. Diuretics remove extra water and sodium (salt) from your body. This lowers the amount of fluid in your blood. Diuretics are often used with other high blood pressure medicines, sometimes in one combined pill. Often, two or more medicines work better than one.

Heart valve disease happens when one or more of your heart valves don't work well. Your heart has four valves: the tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, and aortic valves. The valves have flaps that open and close. The flaps make sure that blood flows in the right direction through your heart and to the rest of your body. When your heart beats, the flaps open to let blood through. Between heartbeats they close to stop the blood from flowing backwards. If one or more of your heart valves doesn't open or close correctly, it can affect your blood flow and strain your heart. Fortunately, treatment helps most valve diseases. What are the types of heart valve diseases? Heart valves can have three basic kinds of problems: Regurgitation , or backflow, happens when the flaps of a valve don't close tightly. This allows the blood to leak backwards. A common cause of regurgitation is prolapse, where the flaps of the valve flop or bulge back. Prolapse most often affects the mitral valve . Stenosis happens when the flaps of a valve become thick, stiff, or stuck together. This prevents the heart valve from opening all the way. Not enough blood can pass through the valve. Aortic valve stenosis is a common type of stenosis. It affects the valve that controls blood flow into the large artery that carries blood out of the heart to the body. Atresia happens when a heart valve did not form properly and does not have an opening for blood to pass through. Sometimes a valve can have both regurgitation and stenosis. What causes heart valve diseases? Some people are born with heart valve disease. This is called congenital heart valve disease. It can happen alone or along with other congenital heart defects . Heart valve disease can also develop over time as you get older or have certain conditions that affect the heart. Who is more likely to develop heart valve diseases? Your chance of having heart valve disease is higher if: You are older.",condition

You have or have had other conditions that affect your heart and blood vessels. These include: Rheumatic fever. An untreated strep throat can become rheumatic fever, which can harm the heart valves. The damage may not show up for years. Today, most people take antibiotics to cure strep throat before it can cause heart valve damage. Endocarditis . This is a rare infection in the lining of the heart and heart valves. It is usually caused by bacteria in the bloodstream. A heart attack. Heart failure . Coronary artery disease , especially when it affects the aorta (the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the body). High blood pressure. High blood cholesterol . Diabetes . Obesity and overweight. Lack of physical activity . A family history of early heart disease: A father or brother who had heart disease younger than 55. A mother or sister who had heart disease younger than 65. You were born with an aortic valve that wasn't formed right. Sometimes this will cause problems right away. Other times, the valve may work well enough for years before causing problems. What are the symptoms of heart valve diseases? Many people live their whole lives with a heart valve that doesn't work perfectly and never have any problems. But heart valve disease may get worse slowly over time. You may develop signs and symptoms, such as: Shortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air) Fatigue Swelling in your feet, ankles, abdomen (belly), or the veins in your neck Chest pain when you're physically active Arrhythmia , a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat Dizziness or fainting If you don't get treatment for heart valve disease, the symptoms and strain on your heart may keep getting worse.

Your health care provider may listen to your heart with a stethoscope and hear that your heart makes abnormal sounds, such as a click or a heart murmur. These sounds may mean a valve isn't working normally. The provider will usually refer you to a cardiologist, a doctor who specializes in heart diseases. The doctor will also listen to your heart and will do a physical exam. You will also likely need to have one or more heart tests . What are the treatments for heart valve diseases? Most heart valve problems can be treated successfully. Treatment may include: Medicines to control your symptoms and keep your heart pumping well Heart-healthy lifestyle changes to treat other related heart conditions Surgery to repair or replace a valve It's possible that you may need surgery, even if you don't have symptoms. Fixing the valve can help prevent future heart problems. There are many ways to do heart valve surgery. You and your doctor can decide what's best for you, based on your valve problem and general health. Heart valve repair surgery has fewer risks than heart valve replacement. So, when repair is possible, it's preferred over valve replacement. In some cases, valve replacement is necessary. There are 2 types of replacement valves: Biologic valves made from pig, cow, or human tissue. These valves tend to wear out after 10 to 15 years, but some may last longer. Mechanical (human-made) valves usually don't wear out. But with a mechanical valve, you usually have to take blood thinners for the rest of your life to prevent blood clots.

Aphasia is a language disorder that makes it hard for you to read, write, and say what you mean to say. Sometimes it makes it hard to understand what other people are saying, too. Aphasia is not a disease. It's a symptom of damage to the parts of the brain that control language. The signs of aphasia depend on which part of the brain is damaged. There are four main types of aphasia: Expressive aphasia is when you know what you want to say, but you have trouble saying or writing your thoughts. Receptive aphasia affects your ability to read and understand speech. You can hear what people say or see words on a page, but you have trouble making sense of what they mean. Global aphasia is the loss of almost all language ability. You can't speak, understand speech, read, or write. Anomic or amnesia aphasia is when you have trouble using the right words for certain things, people, places or events. In some cases, aphasia may get better on its own. But it can be a long-term condition. There's no cure, but treatment may help improve language skills. What causes aphasia? Aphasia happens from damage to one or more parts of the brain involved with language. The damage may be from: Stroke , which is the most common cause of aphasia Brain tumor Brain infection or inflammation Brain injury Other brain disorders or neurologic diseases that affect the brain and get worse over time, such as dementia Who is more likely to develop aphasia? Anyone can have aphasia at any age, but most people with aphasia are middle-aged or older. Most aphasia happens suddenly from a stroke or brain injury. Aphasia from a brain tumor or other brain disorder may develop slowly over time. How is aphasia diagnosed?

These tests measure how much the brain damage has affected the ability to talk, read, write, and understand. In most cases, the tests are done by a speech-language pathologist or speech therapist (a specialist who treats speech and communication disorders ). What are the treatments for aphasia? Some people fully recover from aphasia without treatment. But most people should begin speech-language therapy to treat aphasia as soon as possible. Treatment may be one-on-one with a speech therapist or in a group. Therapy using a computer may also be helpful. The specific therapy depends on the type of language loss that a person has. It may include exercises in reading, writing, following directions, and repeating what the therapist says. Therapy may also include learning how to communicate with gestures, pictures, smartphones, or other electronic devices. Family participation may be an important part of speech therapy. Family members can learn to help with recovery in many ways, such as: Using simpler language Including the person with aphasia in conversations Repeating or writing down key words to help communicate more clearly Language abilities may continue to improve over many years. In general, people recover their ability to understand language more fully than their ability to speak.

An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. Your heart beats too quickly, too slowly, or with an irregular pattern. Changes in the electrical signals that control your heartbeat cause arrhythmias. When your heart beats faster than normal, it's called tachycardia . When your heart beats too slowly, it's called bradycardia . When the signal to beat comes too early, it's called a premature or extra heartbeat . It may feel like your heart skipped a beat. There are many types of arrhythmias. Arrhythmias may affect the upper or lower chamber of your heart. The most common type of arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation , which causes an irregular and fast heartbeat. Some arrhythmias are harmless, such as when your heart rate speeds up during exercise and slows down when you sleep. But if you have a frequent irregular rhythm, it may mean your heart isn't pumping enough blood into your body. Getting treatment and following a heart-healthy lifestyle can help control arrhythmias. It may also help prevent heart damage that can trigger some heart arrhythmias. What causes an arrhythmia?

Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are defects in your vascular system . Your vascular system is your body's network of blood vessels. It includes your: Arteries, which carry oxygen-rich blood from your heart to your tissues and organs. Veins, which carry the blood and waste products back to your heart. Capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels that connect your small arteries to your small veins. An AVM is an abnormal tangle of arteries and veins. They are connected to each other, with no capillaries between them. Without the capillaries, the blood flow from the arteries goes directly into the veins at a faster rate than normal. Because of this, the nearby tissue does not get all the oxygen it would normally get. This lack of oxygen can lead to tissue damage and the death of nerve cells and other cells. The fast rate of blood flow can also increase the blood pressure inside the arteries and veins. This can weaken the arteries and veins. A weakened artery or blood vessel could burst or leak blood. What causes arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)? AVMs are rare. The cause of AVMs is unknown. Most of the time, people are born with them. But sometimes they can appear shortly after birth or later in life. What are the symptoms of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)? The symptoms of AVM will depend on where the AVM is located.

This cloudiness blocks light from reaching the back of the eye, making it harder to see clearly. A cataract can affect one or both eyes, but it doesn't spread from one eye to the other. Cataracts usually develop slowly. As they get worse, your vision can become blurry or dim. Brighter lighting or new eyeglasses may help at first, but if cataracts begin to interfere with your daily activities, you may need cataract surgery.

You may have them every day or only once in a while. When you are having an asthma attack, your symptoms get much worse. The attacks may come on gradually or suddenly. Sometimes they can be life-threatening. They are more common in people who have severe asthma. If you are having asthma attacks, you may need a change in your treatment. How is asthma diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose asthma: Physical exam Medical history Lung function tests , including spirometry, to test how well your lungs work Tests to measure how your airways react to specific exposures. During this test, you inhale different concentrations of allergens or medicines that may tighten the muscles in your airways. Spirometry is done before and after the test. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) tests to measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effort Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests to measure levels of nitric oxide in your breath when you breathe out. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that your lungs are inflamed. Allergy skin or blood tests, if you have a history of allergies. These tests check which allergens cause a reaction from your immune system. What are the treatments for asthma?

Genetics and environment likely play a role in which children get asthma. An asthma attack can happen when your child is exposed to an asthma trigger. An asthma trigger is something that can set off or worsen asthma symptoms. Different triggers can cause different types of asthma: Allergic asthma is caused by allergens. Allergens are substances that cause an allergic reaction. They can include Dust mites Mold Pets Pollen from grass, trees, and weeds Waste from pests such as cockroaches and mice Nonallergic asthma is caused by triggers that are not allergens, such as Breathing in cold air Certain medicines Household chemicals Infections such as colds and the flu Outdoor air pollution Tobacco smoke Exercise-induced asthma happens during physical exercise, especially when the air is dry Asthma triggers may be different for each child and can change over time.

Your immune system protects you from disease and infection by attacking germs that get into your body, such as viruses and bacteria. Your immune system can tell that the germs aren't part of you, so it destroys them. If you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks the healthy cells of your organs and tissues by mistake. There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases. They can affect almost any part of your body. For example, alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease of the skin that causes hair loss. Autoimmune hepatitis affects the liver. In type 1 diabetes , the immune system attacks the pancreas. And in rheumatoid arthritis , the immune system can attack many parts of the body, including the joints, lungs, and eyes. What causes autoimmune diseases? No one is sure why autoimmune diseases happen. But you can't catch them from other people. Autoimmune diseases do tend to run in families, which means that certain genes may make some people more likely to develop a problem. Viruses, certain chemicals, and other things in the environment may trigger an autoimmune disease if you already have the genes for it. Who is at risk for autoimmune diseases? Millions of Americans of all ages have autoimmune diseases. Women develop many types of autoimmune diseases much more often than men. And if you have one autoimmune disease, you are more likely to get another. What are the symptoms of autoimmune diseases? The symptoms of an autoimmune disease depend on the part of your body that's affected. Many types of autoimmune diseases cause redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which are the signs and symptoms of inflammation. But other illnesses can cause the same symptoms.

Hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid, happens when your thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormones to meet your body's needs. Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way the body uses energy. These hormones affect nearly every organ in your body and control many of your body's most important functions. For example, they affect your breathing, heart rate, weight, digestion, and moods. Without enough thyroid hormones, many of your body's functions slow down. But there are treatments that can help. What causes hypothyroidism? Hypothyroidism has several causes. They include: Hashimoto's disease, an autoimmune disorder where your immune system attacks your thyroid. This is the most common cause. Thyroiditis, inflammation of the thyroid Congenital hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism that is present at birth Surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid Radiation treatment of the thyroid Certain medicines In rare cases, a pituitary disease or too much or too little iodine in your diet Who is at risk for hypothyroidism?

Sometimes it can cause trouble with breathing or swallowing. Because hypothyroidism develops slowly, many people don't notice symptoms of the disease for months or even years. What other problems can hypothyroidism cause? Hypothyroidism can contribute to high cholesterol . In rare cases, untreated hypothyroidism can cause myxedema coma. This is a condition in which your body's functions slow down to the point that it becomes life-threatening. During pregnancy, hypothyroidism can cause complications , such as premature birth , high blood pressure in pregnancy , and miscarriage . It can also slow the baby's growth and development . How is hypothyroidism diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, including asking about your symptoms A physical exam Thyroid tests , such as TSH , T3 , T4 , and thyroid antibody blood tests Imaging tests , such as a thyroid scan, ultrasound , or radioactive iodine uptake test. A radioactive iodine uptake test measures how much radioactive iodine your thyroid takes up from your blood after you swallow a small amount of it. What are the treatments for hypothyroidism? The treatment for hypothyroidism is medicine to replace the hormone that your own thyroid can no longer make. About 6 to 8 weeks after you start taking the medicine, you will get a blood test to check your thyroid hormone level. Your health care provider will adjust your dose if needed. Each time your dose is adjusted, you'll have another blood test. Once you find the right dose, you will probably get a blood test in 6 months.",condition

Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a condition in which the heart suddenly stops beating. When that happens, blood stops flowing to the brain and other vital organs. If it is not treated, SCA usually causes death within minutes. But quick treatment with a defibrillator may be lifesaving. How is sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) different from a heart attack? A heart attack is different from an SCA. A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart is blocked. During a heart attack, the heart usually doesn't suddenly stop beating. With an SCA, the heart stops beating. Sometimes an SCA can happen after or during recovery from a heart attack. What causes sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? Your heart has an electrical system that controls the rate and rhythm of your heartbeat. An SCA can happen when the heart's electrical system is not working right and causes irregular heartbeats. Irregular heartbeats are called arrhythmias . There are different types. They may cause the heart to beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm. Some can cause the heart to stop pumping blood to the body; this is the type that causes SCA. Certain diseases and conditions can cause the electrical problems that lead to SCA. They include: Ventricular fibrillation , a type of arrhythmia where the ventricles (the heart's lower chambers) don't beat normally. Instead, they beat very fast and very irregularly. They can't pump blood to the body. This causes most SCAs. Coronary artery disease (CAD) , also called ischemic heart disease. CAD happens when the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. It is often caused by the buildup of plaque , a waxy substance, inside the lining of larger coronary arteries. The plaque blocks some or all of the blood flow to the heart. Some types of physical stress can cause your heart's electrical system to fail, such as Intense physical activity in which your body releases the hormone adrenaline.",condition

Major blood loss Severe lack of oxygen Certain inherited disorders which can cause arrhythmias or problems with the structure of your heart Structural changes in the heart , such as an enlarged heart due to high blood pressure or advanced heart disease. Heart infections can also cause changes to the structure of the heart. Who is at risk for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? You are at higher risk for SCA if you: Have coronary artery disease (CAD). Most people with SCA have CAD. But CAD usually doesn't cause symptoms, so they may not know that they have it. Are older; your risk increases with age Are a man; it is more common in men than women Are Black or African American, especially if you have other conditions such as diabetes , high blood pressure, heart failure , or chronic kidney disease Have a personal history of heartbeats that aren't regular (arrhythmia) Have a personal or family history of SCA or inherited disorders that can cause arrhythmia Have a problem with drug or alcohol use Have had a heart attack Have heart failure What are the symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? Usually, the first sign of SCA is loss of consciousness ( fainting ). This happens when the heart stops beating. Some people may have a racing heartbeat or feel dizzy or light-headed just before they faint. And sometimes people have chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea, or vomiting in the hour before they have an SCA. How is sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) diagnosed? SCA happens without warning and requires emergency treatment. Health care providers rarely diagnose SCA with medical tests as it's happening. Instead, it is usually diagnosed after it happens. Providers do this by ruling out other causes of a person's sudden collapse.",condition

The cardiologist may ask you to get various heart health tests to see how well you heart is working. He or she will work with you to decide whether you need treatment to prevent SCA. What are the treatments for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? SCA is an emergency. A person having SCA needs to be treated with a defibrillator right away. A defibrillator is a device sends an electric shock to the heart. The electric shock can restore a normal rhythm to a heart that's stopped beating. To work well, it needs to be done within minutes of the SCA. Most police officers, emergency medical technicians, and other first responders are trained and equipped to use a defibrillator. Call 9-1-1 right away if someone has signs or symptoms of SCA. The sooner you call for help, the sooner lifesaving treatment can begin. What should I do if I think that someone has had an SCA? Many public places such as schools, businesses, and airports have automated external defibrillators (AEDs). AEDs are special defibrillators that untrained people can use if they think that someone has had SCA. AEDS are programmed to give an electric shock if they detect a dangerous arrhythmia. This prevents giving a shock to someone who may have fainted but isn't having SCA. If you see someone who you think has had SCA, you should give cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) until defibrillation can be done. People who are at risk for SCA may want to consider having an AED at home. Ask your cardiologist to help you decide whether having an AED in your home might help you. What are the treatments after surviving sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? If you survive SCA, you'll likely be admitted to a hospital for ongoing care and treatment. In the hospital, your medical team will closely watch your heart. They may give you medicines to try to reduce the risk of another SCA.",condition

These procedures help restore blood flow through narrowed or blocked coronary arteries. Often, people who have had SCA get a device called an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) . This small device is surgically placed under the skin in your chest or abdomen. An ICD uses electric pulses or shocks to help control dangerous arrhythmias. Can sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) be prevented? You may be able to lower your risk of SCA by following a heart-healthy lifestyle .

Hyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid, happens when your thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs. Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way the body uses energy. These hormones affect nearly every organ in your body and control many of your body's most important functions.

This is the most common cause. Thyroid nodules, which are growths on your thyroid. They are usually benign (not cancer). But they may become overactive and make too much thyroid hormone. Thyroid nodules are more common in older adults. Thyroiditis, inflammation of the thyroid. It causes stored thyroid hormone to leak out of your thyroid gland. Too much iodine. Iodine is found in some medicines, cough syrups, seaweed and seaweed-based supplements. Taking too much of them can cause your thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone. Too much thyroid medicine.

A radioactive iodine uptake test measures how much radioactive iodine your thyroid takes up from your blood after you swallow a small amount of it. What are the treatments for hyperthyroidism? The treatments for hyperthyroidism include medicines, radioiodine therapy, and thyroid surgery: Medicines for hyperthyroidism include Antithyroid medicines, which cause your thyroid to make less thyroid hormone. You probably need to take the medicines for 1 to 2 years. In some cases, you might need to take the medicines for several years. This is the simplest treatment, but it is often not a permanent cure. Beta blocker medicines, which can reduce symptoms such as tremors, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness. They work quickly and can help you feel better until other treatments take effect. Radioiodine therapy is a common and effective treatment for hyperthyroidism. It involves taking radioactive iodine by mouth as a capsule or liquid. This slowly destroys the cells of the thyroid gland that produce thyroid hormone. It does not affect other body tissues. Almost everyone who has radioactive iodine treatment later develops hypothyroidism. This is because the thyroid hormone-producing cells have been destroyed. But hypothyroidism is easier to treat and causes fewer long-term health problems than hyperthyroidism. Surgery to remove part or most of the thyroid gland is done in rare cases.

For more in-depth information, see our health professional fact sheet . What are vitamin A and carotenoids and what do they do? Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in many foods. Vitamin A is important for normal vision, the immune system , reproduction, and growth and development. Vitamin A also helps your heart, lungs , and other organs work properly. Carotenoids are pigments that give yellow, orange, and red fruits and vegetables their color. Your body is able to convert some carotenoids into vitamin A. There are two different sources for vitamin A: Preformed vitamin A is found in fish, organ meats (such as liver ), dairy products, and eggs. Provitamin A carotenoids are turned into vitamin A by your body. They are found in fruits, vegetables, and other plant-based products. The most common provitamin A carotenoid in foods and dietary supplements is beta-carotene . How much vitamin A do I need? The amount of vitamin A you need depends on your age and sex. Average daily recommended amounts of preformed vitamin A and provitamin A carotenoids are listed below in micrograms (mcg) of retinol activity equivalents (RAE).

Vitamin A is available in dietary supplements , usually in the form of retinyl acetate or retinyl palmitate (preformed vitamin A), beta-carotene (provitamin A), or a combination of preformed and provitamin A. Most multivitamin/mineral supplements contain vitamin A. Dietary supplements that contain only vitamin A are also available. Am I getting enough vitamin A? Vitamin A deficiency is rare in the United States because most people get enough vitamin A from the foods they eat. However, vitamin A deficiency is common in many developing countries, especially in young children. Certain groups of people are more likely than others to have trouble getting enough vitamin A: Premature infants Infants, young children, pregnant women, and breastfeeding women in developing countries People with cystic fibrosis People with Crohn’s disease , ulcerative colitis , or celiac disease What happens if I don’t get enough vitamin A? The most common sign of vitamin A deficiency is an eye condition called xerophthalmia. Xerophthalmia is the inability to see in low light, and it can lead to blindness if it isn’t treated . A long-term deficiency of vitamin A can also lead to a higher risk of respiratory diseases (such as pneumonia ) and infections (such as measles and diarrhea ).

What are some effects of vitamin A on health? Scientists are studying vitamin A to understand how it affects health. Here are some examples of what this research has shown. Cancer People who eat a lot of foods containing vitamin A or beta-carotene might have a lower risk of certain kinds of cancer. However, studies do not show that vitamin A or beta-carotene supplements help prevent cancer or lower the chances of dying of cancer. In fact, some studies find that in people who smoke or used to smoke, high doses of beta-carotene supplements can increase the risk of lung cancer and death. Age-related macular degeneration Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the loss of central vision as people age. It’s the most common cause of vision loss in older people. Studies show that a supplement containing vitamins C and E, zinc , and copper with or without beta-carotene helps slow down the rate of vision loss in people with AMD who are at high risk of developing advanced AMD. The same supplement, containing lutein and zeaxanthin instead of beta-carotene, reduces the risk of progression to advanced AMD even more and eliminates the increased risk of lung cancer from high doses of beta-carotene. Measles In developing countries where vitamin A deficiency is common, children with measles are more likely to have severe symptoms and may die from the disease. In these children, taking vitamin A supplements can help prevent new cases of measles but probably doesn’t lower their risk of dying of measles. Can vitamin A be harmful? Yes, high intakes of some forms of vitamin A can be harmful.

Most people in the United States get enough vitamin B12 from the foods they eat. However, some people have trouble absorbing vitamin B12 from food. The body absorbs vitamin B12 from food in a two-step process. First, hydrochloric acid in the stomach separates vitamin B12 from the protein that it’s attached to. Second, the freed vitamin B12 then combines with a protein made by the stomach, called intrinsic factor , and the body absorbs them together. Vitamin B12 in dietary supplements isn’t attached to protein and doesn’t require the first step. However, B12 in supplements does need to combine with intrinsic factor to be absorbed. People with pernicious anemia , an autoimmune disease , can’t make intrinsic factor. As a result, they have trouble absorbing vitamin B12 from foods and dietary supplements. Vitamin B12 deficiency affects between 3% and 43% of older adults. Your doctor can test your vitamin B12 level to see if you have a deficiency. Certain groups of people may not get enough vitamin B12 or have trouble absorbing it: Many older adults don’t have enough hydrochloric acid in their stomach to absorb the vitamin B12 that’s naturally present in food.",supplement

People with an autoimmune disease called atrophic gastritis might not absorb enough vitamin B12 because they make too little hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor in their stomach. People with pernicious anemia do not make the intrinsic factor needed to absorb vitamin B12. As a result, they have trouble absorbing vitamin B12 from foods and dietary supplements. Doctors usually treat pernicious anemia with vitamin B12 shots, although very high doses of vitamin B12 given by mouth might also be effective. People who have had some types of stomach or intestinal surgery (for example, to lose weight or to remove part or all of the stomach) might not make enough hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor to absorb vitamin B12. People with disorders of the stomach and small intestine , such as celiac disease or Crohn’s disease , might not absorb enough vitamin B12. People who eat little or no animal foods, such as vegetarians and vegans , might not get enough vitamin B12 from their diets. Only animal foods have vitamin B12 naturally.

Some foods and beverages that are fortified with vitamin C. To find out if vitamin C has been added to a food product, check the product labels . The vitamin C content of food may be reduced by prolonged storage and by cooking. Steaming or microwaving may lessen cooking losses. Fortunately, many of the best food sources of vitamin C, such as fruits and vegetables, are usually eaten raw. What kinds of vitamin C dietary supplements are available? Most multivitamins have vitamin C. Vitamin C is also available alone as a dietary supplement or in combination with other nutrients. The vitamin C in dietary supplements is usually in the form of ascorbic acid, but some supplements have other forms, such as sodium ascorbate, calcium ascorbate, other mineral ascorbates, and ascorbic acid with bioflavonoids. Research has not shown that any form of vitamin C is better than the other forms. Am I getting enough vitamin C? Most people in the United States get enough vitamin C from foods and beverages. However, certain groups of people are more likely than others to have trouble getting enough vitamin C: People who smoke and those who are exposed to secondhand smoke , in part because smoke increases the amount of vitamin C that the body needs to repair damage caused by free radicals. People who smoke need 35 mg more vitamin C per day than nonsmokers. Infants who are fed evaporated or boiled cow's milk because cow's milk has very little vitamin C and heat can destroy vitamin C. Cow's milk is not recommended for infants under 1 year of age. Breast milk and infant formula have adequate amounts of vitamin C. People who eat a very limited variety of food.

People who get little or no vitamin C (below about 10 mg per day) for many weeks can get scurvy . Scurvy causes fatigue , inflammation of the gums, small red or purple spots on the skin, joint pain, poor wound healing, and corkscrew hairs. Additional signs of scurvy include depression as well as swollen, bleeding gums and loosening or loss of teeth. People with scurvy can also develop anemia . Scurvy is fatal if it is not treated . What are some effects of vitamin C on health? Scientists are studying vitamin C to understand how it affects health. Here are several examples of what this research has shown. Cancer prevention and treatment People with high intakes of vitamin C from fruits and vegetables might have a lower risk of getting many types of cancer, such as lung , breast, and colon cancer . However, taking vitamin C supplements, with or without other antioxidants, doesn't seem to protect people from getting cancer. It is not clear whether taking high doses of vitamin C is helpful as a treatment for cancer. Vitamin C's effects appear to depend on how it is administered to the patient. Oral doses of vitamin C can't raise blood levels of vitamin C nearly as high as intravenous doses given through injections . A few studies in animals and test tubes indicate that very high blood levels of vitamin C might shrink tumors . However, more research is needed to determine whether high-dose intravenous vitamin C helps treat cancer in people. Vitamin C dietary supplements and other antioxidants might interact with chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer. People being treated for cancer should talk with their oncologist before taking vitamin C or other antioxidant supplements, especially in high doses. Cardiovascular disease People who eat lots of fruits and vegetables seem to have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease .",supplement

However, scientists aren't sure whether vitamin C itself, either from food or supplements, helps protect people from cardiovascular disease. It is also not clear whether vitamin C helps prevent cardiovascular disease from getting worse in people who already have it. Age-related macular degeneration and cataracts Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) and cataracts are two of the leading causes of vision loss in older people. Researchers do not believe that vitamin C and other antioxidants affect the risk of getting AMD. However, research suggests that vitamin C combined with other nutrients might help slow AMD progression . In a large study among older people with AMD who were at high risk of developing advanced AMD, those who took a daily dietary supplement with 500 mg vitamin C, 80 mg zinc , 400 International Units ( IU ) vitamin E , 15 mg beta-carotene , and 2 mg copper for about 6 years had a lower chance of developing advanced AMD. They also had less vision loss than those who did not take the dietary supplement. People who have or are developing the disease might want to talk with their doctor about taking dietary supplements. The relationship between vitamin C and cataract formation is unclear. Some studies show that people who get more vitamin C from foods have a lower risk of getting cataracts. However, further research is needed to clarify this association and to determine whether vitamin C supplements affect the risk of getting cataracts. The common cold Although vitamin C has long been a popular remedy for the common cold , research shows that for most people, vitamin C supplements do not reduce the risk of getting the common cold. However, people who take vitamin C supplements regularly might have slightly shorter colds or somewhat milder symptoms when they do have a cold.",supplement

Vitamin C dietary supplements can interact or interfere with medicines that you take. Here are several examples: Vitamin C dietary supplements might interact with cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. It is not clear whether vitamin C might have the unwanted effect of protecting tumor cells from cancer treatments or whether it might help protect normal tissues from getting damaged. If you are being treated for cancer, check with your health care provider before taking vitamin C or other antioxidant supplements, especially in high doses.

For more in-depth information, see our health professional fact sheet . For information on vitamin D and COVID-19, see Dietary Supplements in the Time of COVID-19 . What is vitamin D and what does it do? Vitamin D is a nutrient you need for good health. It helps your body absorb calcium , one of the main building blocks for strong bones. Together with calcium, vitamin D helps protect you from developing osteoporosis , a disease that thins and weakens the bones and makes them more likely to break. Your body needs vitamin D for other functions too. Your muscles need it to move, and your nerves need it to carry messages between your brain and your body. Your immune system needs vitamin D to fight off invading bacteria and viruses . How much vitamin D do I need? The amount of vitamin D you need each day depends on your age. Average daily recommended amounts are listed below in micrograms (mcg) and International Units ( IU ). Life Stage Recommended Amount Birth to 12 months 10 mcg (400 IU) Children 1–13 years 15 mcg (600 IU) Teens 14–18 years 15 mcg (600 IU) Adults 19–70 years 15 mcg (600 IU) Adults 71 years and older 20 mcg (800 IU) Pregnant and breastfeeding teens and women 15 mcg (600 IU) What foods provide vitamin D? Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D. Fortified foods provide most of the vitamin D in the diets of people in the United States. Check the Nutrition Facts label for the amount of vitamin D in a food or beverage. Almost all of the U.S. milk supply is fortified with about 3 mcg (120 IU) vitamin D per cup. Many plant-based alternatives such as soy milk, almond milk, and oat milk are similarly fortified, but foods made from milk, like cheese and ice cream, are usually not fortified. Vitamin D is added to many breakfast cereals and to some brands of orange juice, yogurt, margarine, and other food products.",supplement

Beef liver, egg yolks, and cheese have small amounts of vitamin D. Mushrooms provide a little vitamin D. Some mushrooms have been exposed to ultraviolet light to increase their vitamin D content. Can I get vitamin D from the sun? Your body makes vitamin D when your bare skin is exposed to the sun. Most people get at least some vitamin D this way. However, clouds, smog, old age, and having dark-colored skin reduce the amount of vitamin D your skin makes. Also, your skin does not make vitamin D from sunlight through a window. Ultraviolet radiation from sunshine can cause skin cancer , so it’s important to limit how much time you spend in the sun. Although sunscreen limits vitamin D production, health experts recommend using sunscreen with a sun protection factor ( SPF ) of 15 or more when you’re out in the sun for more than a few minutes. What kinds of vitamin D dietary supplements are available? Vitamin D is found in multivitamin/mineral supplements. It is also available in dietary supplements containing only vitamin D or vitamin D combined with a few other nutrients. The two forms of vitamin D in supplements are D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol). Both forms increase vitamin D in your blood, but D3 might raise it higher and for longer than D2. Because vitamin D is fat soluble, it is best absorbed when taken with a meal or snack that includes some fat. Am I getting enough vitamin D? Because you get vitamin D from food, sunshine, and dietary supplements, one way to know if you’re getting enough is a blood test that measures the amount of vitamin D in your blood. In the blood, a form of vitamin D known as 25-hydroxyvitamin D is measured in either nanomoles per liter (nmol/L) or nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). One nmol/L is equal to 0.4 ng/mL. So, for example, 50 nmol/L is the same as 20 ng/mL.",supplement

Levels below 30 nmol/L (12 ng/mL) are too low and might weaken your bones and affect your health. Levels above 125 nmol/L (50 ng/mL) are too high and might cause health problems. In the United States, most people have adequate blood levels of vitamin D. However, almost one out of four people have vitamin D blood levels that are too low or inadequate for bone and overall health. Some people are more likely than others to have trouble getting enough vitamin D: Breastfed infants . Breast milk alone does not provide infants with an adequate amount of vitamin D. Breastfed infants should be given a supplement of 10 mcg (400 IU) of vitamin D each day. Older adults. As you age, your skin's ability to make vitamin D when exposed to sunlight declines. People who seldom expose their skin to sunshine because they do not go outside or because they keep their body and head covered. Sunscreen also limits the amount of vitamin D your skin produces. People with dark skin. The darker your skin, the less vitamin D you make from sunlight exposure. People with conditions that limit fat absorption , such as Crohn’s disease , celiac disease , or ulcerative colitis . This is because the vitamin D you consume is absorbed in the gut along with fat, so if your body has trouble absorbing fat, it will also have trouble absorbing vitamin D. People with obesity or who have undergone gastric bypass surgery. They may need more vitamin D than other people. What happens if I don’t get enough vitamin D? In children, vitamin D deficiency causes rickets , a disease in which the bones become soft, weak, deformed, and painful. In teens and adults, vitamin D deficiency causes osteomalacia , a disorder that causes bone pain and muscle weakness. What are some effects of vitamin D on health?

Bone health and osteoporosis Long-term shortages of vitamin D and calcium cause your bones to become fragile and break more easily. This condition is called osteoporosis. Millions of older women and men have osteoporosis or are at risk of developing this condition. Muscles are also important for healthy bones because they help maintain balance and prevent falls. A shortage of vitamin D may lead to weak, painful muscles. Getting recommended amounts of vitamin D and calcium from foods (and supplements, if needed) will help maintain healthy bones and prevent osteoporosis. Taking vitamin D and calcium supplements slightly increases bone strength in older adults, but it’s not clear whether they reduce the risk of falling or breaking a bone. Cancer Vitamin D does not seem to reduce the risk of developing cancer of the breast, colon , rectum, or lung . It is not clear whether vitamin D affects the risk of prostate cancer or chance of surviving this cancer. Very high blood levels of vitamin D may even increase the risk of pancreatic cancer . Clinical trials suggest that while vitamin D supplements (with or without calcium) may not affect your risk of getting cancer, they might slightly reduce your risk of dying from this disease. More research is needed to better understand the role that vitamin D plays in cancer prevention and cancer-related death. Heart disease Vitamin D is important for a healthy heart and blood vessels and for normal blood pressure. Some studies show that vitamin D supplements might help reduce blood cholesterol levels and high blood pressure —two of the main risk factors for heart disease. Other studies show no benefits. If you are overweight or have obesity, taking vitamin D at doses above 20 mcg (800 IU) per day plus calcium might actually raise your blood pressure.",supplement

Depression Vitamin D is needed for your brain to function properly. Some studies have found links between low blood levels of vitamin D and an increased risk of depression. However, clinical trials show that taking vitamin D supplements does not prevent or ease symptoms of depression. Multiple sclerosis People who live near the equator have more sun exposure and higher vitamin D levels. They also rarely develop multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease that affects the nerves that carry messages from the brain to the rest of the body. Many studies find a link between low blood vitamin D levels and the risk of developing MS. However, scientists have not actually studied whether vitamin D supplements can prevent MS. In people who have MS, clinical trials show that taking vitamin D supplements does not keep symptoms from getting worse or coming back. Type 2 diabetes Vitamin D helps your body regulate blood sugar levels. However, clinical trials in people with and without diabetes show that supplemental vitamin D does not improve blood sugar levels, insulin resistance , or hemoglobin A1c levels (the average level of blood sugar over the past 3 months). Other studies show that vitamin D supplements don’t stop most people with prediabetes from developing diabetes. Weight loss Taking vitamin D supplements or eating foods that are rich in vitamin D does not help you lose weight. Can vitamin D be harmful? Yes, getting too much vitamin D can be harmful. Very high levels of vitamin D in your blood (greater than 375 nmol/L or 150 ng/mL) can cause nausea , vomiting, muscle weakness, confusion, pain, loss of appetite, dehydration, excessive urination and thirst, and kidney stones .

For more in-depth information, see our health professional fact sheet . What is vitamin E and what does it do? Vitamin E is a fat-soluble nutrient found in many foods. In the body, it acts as an antioxidant , helping to protect cells from the damage caused by free radicals . Free radicals are compounds formed when our bodies convert the food we eat into energy. People are also exposed to free radicals in the environment from cigarette smoke, air pollution, and ultraviolet light from the sun. The body also needs vitamin E to boost its immune system so that it can fight off invading bacteria and viruses . It helps to widen blood vessels and keep blood from clotting within them. In addition, cells use vitamin E to interact with each other and to carry out many important functions. How much vitamin E do I need? The amount of vitamin E you need each day depends on your age.

What kinds of vitamin E dietary supplements are available? Vitamin E supplements come in different amounts and forms. Two main things to consider when choosing a vitamin E supplement are: The amount of vitamin E: Most once-daily multivitamin/mineral supplements provide about 13.5 mg of vitamin E, whereas vitamin E-only supplements commonly contain 67 mg or more. The doses in most vitamin E-only supplements are much higher than the recommended amounts. Some people take large doses because they believe or hope that doing so will keep them healthy or lower their risk of certain diseases. The form of vitamin E: Although vitamin E sounds like a single substance, it is actually the name of eight related compounds in food, including alpha-tocopherol . Each form has a different potency, or level of activity in the body. Vitamin E from natural sources is commonly listed as d -alpha-tocopherol on food packaging and supplement labels. Synthetic (laboratory-made) vitamin E is commonly listed as dl -alpha-tocopherol. The natural form is more potent; 1 mg vitamin E = 1 mg d -alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) = 2 mg dl -alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E). Some food and dietary supplement labels still list vitamin E in International Units ( IUs ) rather than mg. One IU of the natural form of vitamin E is equivalent to 0.67 mg. One IU of the synthetic form of vitamin E is equivalent to 0.45 mg. Some vitamin E supplements provide other forms of the vitamin, such as gamma-tocopherol, tocotrienols, and mixed tocopherols. Scientists do not know if any of these forms are superior to alpha-tocopherol in supplements. Am I getting enough vitamin E? The diets of most Americans provide less than the recommended amounts of vitamin E. Nevertheless, healthy people rarely show any clear signs that they are not getting enough vitamin E (see next question for information on the signs of vitamin E deficiency ).",supplement

Vitamin E deficiency is very rare in healthy people. It is almost always linked to certain diseases in which fat is not properly digested or absorbed . Examples include Crohn's disease , cystic fibrosis , and certain rare genetic diseases such as abetalipoproteinemia and ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED). Vitamin E needs some fat for the digestive system to absorb it. Vitamin E deficiency can cause nerve and muscle damage that results in loss of feeling in the arms and legs, loss of body movement control , muscle weakness, and vision problems. Another sign of deficiency is a weakened immune system. What are some effects of vitamin E on health? Scientists are studying vitamin E to understand how it affects health. Here are several examples of what this research has shown. Heart disease Some studies link higher intakes of vitamin E from supplements to lower chances of developing coronary heart disease . However, the best research finds no benefit. People in these studies are randomly assigned to take vitamin E or a placebo (dummy pill with no vitamin E or active ingredients ) and they don't know which they are taking. Vitamin E supplements do not seem to prevent heart disease, reduce its severity, or affect the risk of death from this disease. Scientists do not know whether high intakes of vitamin E might protect the heart in younger, healthier people who do not have a high risk of heart disease. Cancer Most research indicates that vitamin E does not help prevent cancer and may be harmful in some cases. Large doses of vitamin E have not consistently reduced the risk of colon and breast cancer in studies, for example. A large study found that taking vitamin E supplements (180 mg/day [400 IU]) for several years increased the risk of developing prostate cancer in men.",supplement

However, one study found a link between the use of vitamin E supplements for 10 years or more and a lower risk of death from bladder cancer . Vitamin E dietary supplements and other antioxidants might interact with chemotherapy and radiation therapy . People undergoing these treatments should talk with their doctor or oncologist before taking vitamin E or other antioxidant supplements, especially in high doses. Eye disorders Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), or the loss of central vision in older people, and cataracts are among the most common causes of vision loss in older people. The results of research on whether vitamin E can help prevent these conditions are inconsistent. Among people with AMD who were at high risk of developing advanced AMD, a supplement containing large doses of vitamin E combined with other antioxidants, zinc , and copper showed promise for slowing down the rate of vision loss. Mental function Several studies have investigated whether vitamin E supplements might help older adults remain mentally alert and active as well as prevent or slow the decline of mental function and Alzheimer's disease . So far, the research provides little evidence that taking vitamin E supplements can help healthy people or people with mild mental functioning problems to maintain brain health. Can vitamin E be harmful? Vitamin E that is naturally present in food and beverages is not harmful and does not need to be limited. In supplement form, however, high doses of vitamin E might increase the risk of bleeding (by reducing the blood's ability to form clots after a cut or injury) and of serious bleeding in the brain (known as hemorrhagic stroke ). Because of this risk, the upper limit for adults is 1,000 mg/day for supplements of either natural or synthetic vitamin E.",supplement

In one study, for example, men who took 400 IU (180 mg) of synthetic vitamin E each day for several years had an increased risk of prostate cancer. Does vitamin E interact with medications or other dietary supplements? Vitamin E dietary supplements can interact or interfere with certain medicines that you take. Here are some examples: Vitamin E can increase the risk of bleeding in people taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medicines, such as warfarin (Coumadin).

Severe vitamin K deficiency can cause bruising and bleeding problems because the blood will take longer to clot. Vitamin K deficiency might reduce bone strength and increase the risk of getting osteoporosis because the body needs vitamin K for healthy bones. What are some effects of vitamin K on health? Scientists are studying vitamin K to understand how it affects our health. Here are some examples of what this research has shown. Osteoporosis Vitamin K is important for healthy bones. Some research shows that people who eat more vitamin K-rich foods have stronger bones and are less likely to break a hip than those who eat less of these foods. A few studies have found that taking vitamin K supplements improves bone strength and lessens the chances of breaking a bone, but other studies have not. More research is needed to better understand if vitamin K supplements can help improve bone health and reduce osteoporosis risk. Coronary heart disease Scientists are studying whether low blood levels of vitamin K increase the risk of coronary heart disease , perhaps by making blood vessels that feed the heart stiffer and narrower. More research is needed to understand whether vitamin K supplements might help prevent heart disease. Can vitamin K be harmful? Vitamin K has not been shown to cause any harm.

In dietary supplements, folate is usually in the form of folic acid, but methylfolate (5-MTHF) is also used. Dietary supplements containing 5-MTHF might be better than folic acid for some individuals who have a gene variant called MTHFR C677T because their bodies can use this form more easily. However, all women and teen girls who could become pregnant should get 400 mcg a day of folic acid, not 5-MTHF, even if they have an MTHFR C677T gene variant (see Neural tube defects below). Am I getting enough folate? Most people in the United States get enough folate. However, certain people are more likely than others to have trouble getting enough folate: Teen girls age 14–18 years, women age 19–30 years, and non-Hispanic black women People with alcohol use disorder People with disorders that lower nutrient absorption (such as celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease ) People with an MTHFR gene variant What happens if I don’t get enough folate?

Folate deficiency can also cause open sores on the tongue and inside the mouth as well as changes in the color of the skin, hair, or fingernails. Women who don't get enough folate are at risk of having babies with neural tube defects , such as spina bifida . Folate deficiency can also increase the likelihood of having a premature or low birth weight baby. What are some effects of folate on health? Scientists are studying folate to understand how it affects health. Here are several examples of what this research has shown. Neural tube defects Taking folic acid before becoming pregnant and during early pregnancy helps prevent neural tube defects in babies. Neural tube defects are major birth defects in a baby’s brain ( anencephaly ) or spine (spina bifida). However, about half of all pregnancies are unplanned. Therefore, all women and teen girls who could become pregnant should consume 400 mcg of folic acid daily from supplements, fortified foods, or both—even if they have an MTHFR C677T gene variant—in addition to the folate they get from following a healthy eating pattern. Since 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required food companies to add folic acid to enriched bread, flour, cornmeal, pasta, rice, and other grain products sold in the United States. In 2016, FDA allowed manufacturers to voluntarily add folic acid to corn masa flour. Because most people in the United States eat these foods, folic acid intakes have increased since 1998, and the number of babies born with neural tube defects has decreased. Cancer Folate that is naturally present in food may decrease the risk of several forms of cancer, but folate supplements might have different effects on cancer risk depending on how much the person takes and when.",natural_remedy

For this reason, people should be cautious about taking high doses of folic acid supplements (more than the upper limit of 1,000 mcg), especially if they have a history of colorectal adenomas (which sometimes turn into cancer). More research is needed to understand the roles of dietary folate and folic acid supplements in cancer risk. Depression People with low blood levels of folate might be more likely to have depression. In addition, they might not respond as well to antidepressant treatment as people with normal folate levels. Folate supplements, particularly those that contain 5-MTHF, might make antidepressant medications more effective. However, whether supplements help both people with normal folate levels and those with folate deficiency isn’t clear. More research is needed to better understand the role of folate in depression and whether folate supplements are helpful when used in combination with standard treatment . Heart disease and stroke Folic acid supplements lower levels of homocysteine , an amino acid in the blood that’s linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease , but the supplements don’t directly decrease the risk of heart disease. Some studies have shown that a combination of folic acid with other B-vitamins, however, helps prevent stroke . Dementia, cognitive function, and Alzheimer's disease Folic acid supplements, with or without other B-vitamins, do not seem to improve cognitive function or prevent dementia or Alzheimer’s disease .

Autism spectrum disorder Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects communication and behavior, usually beginning by age 2. People with ASD have limited interests, repetitive behaviors, and difficulty communicating and interacting with others. Some studies have shown that taking recommended amounts of folic acid before and during early pregnancy may help reduce the risk of ASD in the child. However, because the study results are inconclusive, more research is needed to understand the potential role of folic acid in lowering the risk of ASD. Can folate be harmful? Folate that is naturally present in food and beverages is not harmful. However, you should not consume folate in supplements or fortified foods and beverages in amounts above the upper limit, unless recommended by a health care provider. Taking large amounts of folate supplements might hide a vitamin B12 deficiency because these supplements can correct the anemia that the vitamin B12 deficiency causes but not the nerve damage that the vitamin B12 deficiency also causes. The vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to permanent damage of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves . Large doses of folate supplements might also worsen the symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency. High doses of folic acid might increase the risk of colorectal cancer and possibly other cancers in some people. High doses can also lead to more folic acid in the body than it can use, but whether these increased folic acid levels are harmful is not completely clear. The daily upper limits for folate from supplements and fortified foods and beverages are listed below.

For more in-depth information, see our health professional fact sheet . What is calcium and what does it do? Calcium is a mineral your body needs to build and maintain strong bones and to carry out many important functions. Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body. Almost all calcium in the body is stored in bones and teeth, giving them structure and hardness. Your body needs calcium for muscles to move and for nerves to carry messages between your brain and every part of your body. Calcium also helps blood vessels move blood throughout your body and helps release hormones that affect many functions in your body. Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium. How much calcium do I need? The amount of calcium you need each day depends on your age and sex. Average daily recommended amounts are listed below in milligrams (mg). Life Stage Recommended Amount Birth to 6 months 200 mg Infants 7–12 months 260 mg Children 1–3 years 700 mg Children 4–8 years 1,000 mg Children 9–13 years 1,300 mg Teens 14–18 years 1,300 mg Adults 19–50 years 1,000 mg Adult men 51–70 years 1,000 mg Adult women 51–70 years 1,200 mg Adults 71 years and older 1,200 mg Pregnant and breastfeeding teens 1,300 mg Pregnant and breastfeeding women 1,000 mg What foods provide calcium? Calcium is found in many foods. You can get recommended amounts of calcium by eating a variety of foods, including the following: Milk, yogurt, and cheese are the main food sources of calcium for most people in the United States. Canned sardines and salmon with bones contain calcium. Certain vegetables such as kale, broccoli, and Chinese cabbage (bok choi) also contain calcium. Calcium is added to some beverages, including many fruit juices and milk substitutes such as soy and almond beverages, as well as some brands of tofu and ready-to-eat cereals.

However, because people eat them often, what they contribute adds up. What kinds of calcium dietary supplements are available? Calcium is found in many multivitamin/mineral supplements , in calcium supplements, and in supplements that contain calcium and other nutrients such as vitamin D. Check the Supplement Facts label to determine the amount of calcium in the supplement. The two main forms of calcium in dietary supplements are calcium carbonate and calcium citrate. Calcium carbonate is absorbed best when taken with food. Some over-the-counter antacids, such as Tums and Rolaids, also contain calcium carbonate. Calcium citrate is absorbed well on an empty stomach or a full stomach. People with low levels of stomach acid—a condition most common in older people—absorb calcium citrate more easily than calcium carbonate. Other forms of calcium in supplements and fortified foods include calcium sulfate, calcium ascorbate, calcium microcrystalline hydroxyapatite, calcium gluconate, calcium lactate, and calcium phosphate. Calcium is absorbed best when you take 500 mg or less at one time. If you take 1,000 mg/day of calcium from supplements, for example, it is better to take a smaller dose twice a day than to take it all at once. Calcium supplements might cause gas, bloating, and constipation in some people. If you have any of these symptoms , try spreading out the calcium dose throughout the day, taking the supplement with meals, or switching the form of calcium you take. Am I getting enough calcium? Many people in the United States get less than recommended amounts of calcium from food and supplements, especially: Children and teens age 4 to 18 years People who are Black or Asian Adults age 50 years and older living in poverty Certain groups of people are more likely than others to have trouble getting enough calcium, including: Postmenopausal women.",supplement

Scientists are studying calcium to understand how it affects health. Here are several examples of what this research has shown. Bone health in older adults After about age 30, bones slowly lose calcium. In middle age, bone loss speeds up and can lead to weak, fragile bones (osteoporosis) and broken bones. Although bone loss is more common in women, it can affect men too. The health of your bones is measured with a bone mineral density test, which will tell whether your bones are healthy and strong or weak and thin. Some studies have found that calcium supplements with or without vitamin D increase bone mineral density in older adults, but others do not.

Fibrocystic breast disease Although not harmful, fibrocystic breast disease causes lumpy, painful breasts. It mainly affects women of reproductive age but can also occur during menopause . Very high doses of iodine supplements might reduce the pain and other symptoms of fibrocystic breast disease, but more study is necessary to confirm this. Check with your health care provider before taking iodine for this condition, especially because iodine can be unsafe at high doses. Radiation-induced thyroid cancer Nuclear accidents can release radioactive iodine into the environment, increasing the risk of thyroid cancer in people who are exposed to the radioactive iodine, especially children. People with iodine deficiency who are exposed to radioactive iodine are especially at risk of developing thyroid cancer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved potassium iodide as a thyroid-blocking agent to reduce the risk of thyroid cancer in radiation emergencies. Low iodine diets for radioactive iodine treatment Radioactive iodine treatment is used to treat some patients with thyroid cancer. Patients preparing for this treatment are usually told to follow a low iodine diet (50 mcg or less per day) for 1 to 2 weeks before treatment begins. Foods that should be avoided when following a low iodine diet include:* Iodized salt Fish and other seafood, liver, seaweed, milk and milk products, and eggs Bread that is made with iodate dough conditioners (check the ingredient listings on product labels) Maraschino cherries and some red or pink beverages because these products are often made with iodine-containing red dyes Some dietary supplements such as kelp products and many multivitamin/mineral supplements (check the Supplement Facts label to see if iodine is listed).",natural_remedy

Your body uses iron to make hemoglobin , a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body, and myoglobin, a protein that provides oxygen to muscles. Your body also needs iron to make some hormones . How much iron do I need? The amount of iron you need each day depends on your age, your sex, and whether you consume a mostly plant-based diet. Average daily recommended amounts are listed below in milligrams (mg). Vegetarians who do not eat meat, poultry , or seafood need almost twice as much iron as listed in the table because the body doesn’t absorb nonheme iron in plant foods as well as heme iron in animal foods.

What kinds of iron dietary supplements are available? Iron is available in many multivitamin/mineral supplements and in supplements that contain only iron. Iron in supplements is often in the form of ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, ferric citrate, or ferric sulfate. Dietary supplements that contain iron have a statement on the label warning that they should be kept out of the reach of children. Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Am I getting enough iron? Most people in the United States get enough iron. However, certain groups of people are more likely than others to have trouble getting enough iron: Teen girls and women with heavy periods Pregnant women and teens Infants (especially if they are premature or low-birth weight) Frequent blood donors People with cancer , gastrointestinal (GI) disorders , or heart failure What happens if I don't get enough iron? In the short term, getting too little iron does not cause obvious symptoms . The body uses its stored iron in the muscles, liver , spleen , and bone marrow . However, when levels of iron stored in the body become low, iron deficiency anemia sets in. Red blood cells become smaller and contain less hemoglobin. As a result, blood carries less oxygen from the lungs throughout the body. Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include GI upset, weakness, tiredness, lack of energy, and problems with concentration and memory. In addition, people with iron deficiency anemia are less able to fight off germs and infections , to work and exercise, and to control their body temperature. Infants and children with iron deficiency anemia might develop learning difficulties.",supplement

It can also occur in people who do not eat meat, poultry, or seafood; lose blood; have GI diseases that interfere with nutrient absorption; or eat poor diets. What are some effects of iron on health? Scientists are studying iron to understand how it affects health. Iron’s most important contribution to health is preventing iron deficiency anemia and resulting problems. Pregnant women During pregnancy, the amount of blood in a woman's body increases, so she needs more iron for herself and her growing baby. Getting too little iron during pregnancy increases a woman's risk of iron deficiency anemia and her infant's risk of low birth weight, premature birth, and low levels of iron. Getting too little iron might also harm her infant’s brain development. Women who are pregnant should talk with their health care provider and take an iron supplement if recommended. Infants and toddlers Iron deficiency anemia in infancy can lead to delayed psychological development, social withdrawal, and less ability to pay attention. By age 6 to 9 months, full-term infants could become iron deficient unless they eat iron- enriched solid foods or drink iron-fortified formula. Anemia of chronic disease Some chronic diseases —such as rheumatoid arthritis , inflammatory bowel disease , and some types of cancer—can interfere with the body's ability to use its stored iron. Taking more iron from foods or supplements usually does not reduce the resulting anemia of chronic disease because iron is diverted from the blood circulation to storage sites. The main therapy for anemia of chronic disease is treatment of the underlying disease. Can iron be harmful? Yes, iron can be harmful if you get too much.",supplement

Large amounts of iron might also cause more serious effects, including inflammation of the stomach lining and ulcers . High doses of iron can also decrease zinc absorption. Extremely high doses of iron (in the hundreds or thousands of mg) can cause organ failure, coma, convulsions, and death. Child-proof packaging and warning labels on iron supplements have greatly reduced the number of accidental iron poisonings in children. Some people have an inherited condition called hemochromatosis that causes toxic levels of iron to build up in their bodies. Without medical treatment, people with hereditary hemochromatosis can develop serious problems such as liver cirrhosis , liver cancer, and heart disease. People with this disorder should avoid using iron supplements and vitamin C supplements. The daily upper limits for iron include intakes from all sources—food, beverages, and supplements—and are listed below. A doctor might prescribe more than the upper limit of iron to people who need higher doses for a while to treat iron deficiency.

Yes, iron supplements can interact or interfere with medicines and other supplements you take. Here are several examples: Iron supplements can reduce the amount of levodopa that the body absorbs, making it less effective. Levodopa, found in Sinemet and Stalevo, is used to treat Parkinson’s disease and restless leg syndrome . Taking iron with levothyroxine can reduce this medication’s effectiveness .

Phosphorus deficiency is rare in the United States. A phosphorus deficiency can cause loss of appetite, anemia (low red blood cell counts), muscle weakness, coordination problems, bone pain, soft and deformed bones, a higher risk of infection , a feeling of burning or prickling in the skin, and confusion. What are some effects of phosphorus on health? Scientists are studying phosphorus to better understand how it affects health. Here are two examples of what this research has shown. Chronic kidney disease In severe chronic kidney disease , the kidneys stop working properly and can’t get rid of excess phosphorus. Phosphorus then builds up in the blood and can affect bone health and worsen kidney disease, and it might increase the risk of death. Consuming less phosphorus and eating more foods containing calcium might help prevent the side effects of high phosphorus levels in people with severe chronic kidney disease. Cardiovascular disease Some studies show that high blood levels of phosphorus might increase the risk of an irregular heartbeat and of death from heart disease. However, other studies haven’t found a link between phosphorus levels and heart disease risk. More research is needed to understand whether limiting the amount of phosphorus in a person’s diet has any effect on their risk of heart and blood vessel disease. Can phosphorus be harmful? High phosphorus intakes seldom cause problems in healthy people. However, you shouldn’t get more phosphorus than the upper limits from food, beverages, and dietary supplements unless your health care provider recommends doing this. The daily upper limits for phosphorus include intakes from all sources—food, beverages, and supplements—and are listed below in milligrams (mg).",natural_remedy

Yes, phosphorus can interact with medicines that you take, and some medicines can affect phosphorus levels in your body. Here are two examples: Antacids containing aluminum hydroxide or calcium carbonate can reduce the amount of phosphorus your body absorbs . Examples of these antacids are Maalox, Rulox, Rolaids, and Tums. Using these antacids for 3 months or longer can lead to low levels of phosphorus. Some laxatives , such as Fleet Prep Kit #1, contain sodium phosphate and can increase phosphorus levels. Taking more than the recommended dose of these laxatives can be dangerous, especially if you are dehydrated or have kidney disease or heart disease.

Research has not shown that any form of potassium is better than the others. Most dietary supplements provide only small amounts of potassium, no more than 99 mg per serving. Am I getting enough potassium? The diets of many people in the United States provide less than recommended amounts of potassium. Even when food and dietary supplements are combined, total potassium intakes for most people are below recommended amounts. Certain groups of people are more likely than others to have trouble getting enough potassium: People with inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis ) People who use certain medications (such as laxatives or some diuretics ) People with pica (meaning that they eat things that aren’t food, such as clay) What happens if I don't get enough potassium? Getting too little potassium can increase blood pressure, deplete calcium in bones, and increase the risk of kidney stones . Prolonged diarrhea or vomiting, laxative abuse, diuretic use, eating clay, heavy sweating, dialysis , or using certain medications can cause severe potassium deficiency . In this condition, called hypokalemia, blood levels of potassium are very low. Symptoms of hypokalemia include constipation , tiredness, muscle weakness, and not feeling well. More severe hypokalemia can cause increased urination, decreased brain function, high blood sugar levels, muscle paralysis, difficulty breathing, and irregular heartbeat.

People with low intakes of potassium have an increased risk of developing high blood pressure, especially if their diet is high in salt (sodium). Increasing the amount of potassium in your diet and decreasing the amount of sodium might help lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk of stroke. Kidney stones Getting too little potassium can deplete calcium from bones and increase the amount of calcium in urine . This calcium can form hard deposits (stones) in your kidneys, which can be very painful. Increasing the amount of potassium in your diet might reduce your risk of developing kidney stones. Bone health People who have high intakes of potassium from fruits and vegetables seem to have stronger bones. Eating more of these foods might improve your bone health by increasing bone mineral density (a measure of bone strength).

Over time, this can increase the risk of developing insulin resistance and lead to type 2 diabetes . However, more research is needed to fully understand whether potassium intakes affect blood sugar levels and the risk of type 2 diabetes. Can potassium be harmful? Potassium from food and beverages has not been shown to cause any harm in healthy people who have normal kidney function. Excess potassium is eliminated in the urine. However, people who have chronic kidney disease and those who use certain medications can develop abnormally high levels of potassium in their blood (a condition called hyperkalemia).

For more in-depth information, see our health professional fact sheet . What are omega-3 fatty acids and what do they do? Omega-3 fatty acids are found in foods, such as fish and flaxseed, and in dietary supplements , such as fish oil. The three main omega-3 fatty acids are alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). ALA is found mainly in plant oils such as flaxseed, soybean , and canola oils. DHA and EPA are found in fish and other seafood. ALA is an essential fatty acid, meaning that your body can’t make it, so you must get it from the foods and beverages you consume . Your body can convert some ALA into EPA and then to DHA, but only in very small amounts. Therefore, getting EPA and DHA from foods (and dietary supplements if you take them) is the only practical way to increase levels of these omega-3 fatty acids in your body. Omega-3s are important components of the membranes that surround each cell in your body. DHA levels are especially high in retina (eye), brain, and sperm cells. Omega-3s also provide calories to give your body energy and have many functions in your heart, blood vessels , lungs , immune system , and endocrine system (the network of hormone -producing glands ). How much omega-3s do I need? Experts have not established recommended amounts for omega-3 fatty acids, except for ALA. Average daily recommended amounts for ALA are listed below in grams (g). The amount you need depends on your age and sex.

Am I getting enough omega-3s? Most people in the United States get enough ALA from the foods they eat. They also get small amounts of EPA and DHA. Recommended amounts of EPA and DHA have not been established. What happens if I don't get enough omega-3s? A deficiency of omega-3s can cause rough, scaly skin and a red, swollen, itchy rash. Omega-3 deficiency is very rare in the United States. What are some effects of omega-3s on health? Scientists are studying omega-3s to understand how they affect health. People who eat fish and other seafood have a lower risk of several chronic diseases . However, it is not clear whether these health benefits come from simply eating these foods or from the omega-3s in these foods. Here are some examples of what the research has shown. Cardiovascular disease Many studies show that eating fatty fish and other types of seafood as part of a healthy eating pattern helps keep your heart healthy and helps protect you from some heart problems. Getting more EPA and DHA from foods or dietary supplements lowers triglyceride levels, for example.",natural_remedy

For people with heart disease, the AHA recommends consuming about 1 g per day EPA plus DHA, preferably from oily fish, but supplements are an option under the guidance of a health care provider. The AHA does not recommend omega-3 supplements for people who do not have a high risk of cardiovascular disease. Infant health and development During pregnancy and breastfeeding, eating 8 to 12 ounces per week of fish and other seafood may improve your baby’s health. However, it is important to choose fish that are higher in EPA and DHA and lower in mercury. Examples are salmon, herring, sardines, and trout. It is not clear whether taking dietary supplements containing EPA and DHA during pregnancy or breastfeeding affects a baby’s health or development. However, some studies show that taking these supplements may slightly increase a baby’s weight at birth and the length of time the baby is in the womb, both of which may be beneficial. Breast milk contains DHA. Most commercial infant formulas also contain DHA. Cancer prevention Some studies suggest that people who get more omega-3s from foods and dietary supplements may have a lower risk of breast cancer and perhaps colorectal cancer . However, a large clinical trial found that omega-3 supplements did not reduce the overall risk of cancer or the risk of breast, prostate, or colorectal cancers. Other clinical trials in progress will help clarify whether omega-3s affect cancer risk. Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, and cognitive function Some—but not all—research shows that people who consume more omega-3s from food such as fish may have a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, dementia , and other problems with cognitive function . More study of the effects of omega-3s on the brain is needed.",natural_remedy

Studies suggest that people who get higher amounts of omega-3s from the foods they eat may have a lower risk of developing AMD. However, once someone has AMD, taking omega-3 supplements does not keep the disease from getting worse or slow down vision loss. Dry eye disease Dry eye disease occurs when tears don’t provide enough moisture, causing eye discomfort and vision problems. Some studies show that getting more omega-3s from foods or supplements—mainly EPA and DHA—helps relieve symptoms of dry eye disease. However, a large, recent study found that the symptoms of people with dry eye disease who took fish oil supplements of 2,000 mg EPA plus 1,000 mg DHA daily for 1 year did not improve any more than those who took a placebo (a dummy pill). Another study in healthy people found that daily supplements of 460 mg EPA plus 380 mg DHA for 5.3 years did not affect the risk of getting dry eye disease. More research on the effects of omega-3s on dry eye disease is needed. Rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) causes chronic pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of function in the joints. Some clinical trials have shown that taking omega-3 supplements may help manage RA when taken together with standard RA medications and other treatments. For example, people with RA who take omega-3 supplements may need less pain-relief medication, but it is not clear if the supplements reduce joint pain, swelling, or morning stiffness. Other conditions Researchers are studying whether taking omega-3 dietary supplements may help lessen some of the symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder , childhood allergies, and cystic fibrosis .

Any side effects from taking omega-3 supplements are usually mild. They include an unpleasant taste in the mouth, bad breath, heartburn, nausea , stomach discomfort, diarrhea , headache, and smelly sweat. Do omega-3s interact with medications or other dietary supplements? Omega-3 dietary supplements may interact with the medications you take. For example, high doses of omega-3s may cause bleeding problems when taken with warfarin (Coumadin) or other anticoagulant medicines. Talk with your health care provider about possible interactions between omega-3 supplements and your medications. Omega-3s and healthful eating People should get most of their nutrients from food and beverages, according to the federal government’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans . Foods contain vitamins , minerals , dietary fiber , and other components that benefit health. In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible to meet needs for one or more nutrients (for example, during specific life stages such as pregnancy).",natural_remedy

For more in-depth information, see our health professional fact sheet . What are probiotics and what do they do? Probiotics are live microorganisms (such as bacteria and yeasts) that provide health benefits when they are taken in sufficient amounts. They are present in some fermented foods, added to other foods, and available as dietary supplements . Probiotics act mainly in the digestive tract . Once in the digestive tract, probiotics may improve the function of your digestive system and other aspects of health. Probiotic microorganisms are named by their genus , species , and strain. An example of a common probiotic microorganism is Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG. In this case, Lacticaseibacillus is the genus, rhamnosus is the species, and GG is the strain. Other common probiotics include specific strains of Limosilactobacillus reuteri and Saccharomyces boulardii . What foods provide probiotics? Microorganisms are used to produce fermented foods, including yogurt, cheese, sourdough bread, pickles, apple cider vinegar, kombucha, miso, kimchi, and sauerkraut. Yogurt, for example, is made by adding live microorganisms (such as Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus ) to milk. However, while microorganisms are used to make these foods, not all these foods necessarily contain probiotics with proven health benefits. Manufacturers will sometimes add probiotics to unfermented foods, such as cereals, juices, milks, nutrition bars, smoothies, and infant and toddler formulas. If a food contains probiotics, the genus, species, and strain of the probiotic should be listed on the product label. What kinds of probiotic dietary supplements are available? Dietary supplements that are labeled as probiotics may contain different microorganisms, and the number of microorganisms they contain can vary widely between products.",natural_remedy
nih_ods_0027_2,Probiotics,NIH Office of Dietary Supplements,https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Probiotics-Consumer/,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Because some of these supplements may not have been studied, any potential health effects they have may not be known. The Supplement Facts label on a dietary supplement that contains probiotics lists the total weight of the microorganisms in the product. Many product labels also list the number of colony-forming units (CFUs) in a serving. The number of CFUs is a more accurate representation of how many active microorganisms are in a product than the total weight of the microorganisms. Examples of amounts of CFUs that you might see on a label are 1 x 10 9 (1 billion) CFUs and 1 x 10 10 (10 billion) CFUs. Higher CFU counts alone do not necessarily mean that the product has greater health benefits. A product’s health benefits, if any, are determined by both the specific microorganisms (or strains) it contains and the number of CFUs. What are some possible effects of probiotics on health? Scientists are studying probiotics to understand how they affect health. Here are some examples of what this research has shown. Atopic dermatitis Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a skin condition that mostly affects children. People with atopic dermatitis have patches of dry, itchy skin. They also experience red rashes that can come and go, and these rashes may develop sores that ooze or bleed when scratched. Some studies have shown that when pregnant women take probiotics and their infants are given probiotics after birth, the infants might have a lower risk of developing atopic dermatitis and experience less severe symptoms of dermatitis. However, the effects vary depending on the probiotic strain used and whether the mother takes it during pregnancy, the infant is given it after birth, or both. Pediatric acute infectious diarrhea Acute infectious diarrhea in infants and children causes loose or liquid stools and three or more bowel movements within 24 hours. This condition is often caused by a viral infection and can last for up to a week.",natural_remedy

Some studies have shown that certain probiotics shorten bouts of acute diarrhea by about 1 day. Other studies, however, have not shown that probiotics are effective. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea Antibiotics, such as erythromycin and penicillin, can kill beneficial microorganisms that live in the digestive tract, which sometimes results in diarrhea. Some probiotic strains might help reduce the risk of antibiotic- associated diarrhea in children and adults. This is especially true when people start taking these products within 2 days of the first antibiotic dose . Necrotizing enterocolitis Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious and sometimes deadly digestive tract illness that mostly affects preterm babies, especially those who are very small. Some probiotic strains might help reduce the risk of NEC in preterm infants. While these products are sometimes used in hospitals, additional research on their safety and effectiveness is needed because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has raised some concerns about their use in preterm infants. Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease that can affect children and adults. Types of IBD include ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. People with IBD commonly have diarrhea, stomach pain, or bloody stools that are caused by chronic inflammation in the digestive tract. Taking probiotics with medications might slightly reduce the severity of the symptoms of ulcerative colitis, but it does not seem to help people with Crohn’s disease. Irritable bowel syndrome Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder that can affect children and adults, especially women. It causes frequent stomach pain and discomfort, bloating, changes in bowel movement frequency, and diarrhea or constipation . The causes of IBS are unclear, but this condition may be a result of changes in the types of microorganisms in the digestive tract.",natural_remedy

However, the effects vary depending on the probiotic strain used, how long it is used, and the symptom being treated. Hypercholesterolemia Very high levels of cholesterol in the blood (a condition known as hypercholesterolemia) and a buildup of cholesterol in blood vessel walls can block the flow of blood to the heart and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease . This condition can affect people of all ages, but it is most common in people over 40 years of age. Some studies have shown that probiotics can slightly lower the levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, but other studies have found no benefits. More research is needed to understand the effects of probiotics on blood cholesterol. Obesity Some studies have shown that probiotics might slightly reduce body weight or body fat. Other studies have shown that probiotics have no effect or might even increase body weight. More research is needed to understand the effects of probiotics on body weight and body fat. Can probiotics be harmful? Most probiotics have been safely used in foods or dietary supplements for decades. Some of the same types of probiotics have been present in fermented food for thousands of years. In healthy people, probiotics may cause gas, but they rarely cause infections or other health problems. However, probiotics might not be safe for everyone. The FDA has reported that probiotics might cause infections or even life-threatening illness in preterm infants. Probiotics might also cause problems such as bacterial infections in people who are already seriously ill or who have weak immune systems . What should I know about choosing a probiotic?

Some products list the number of CFUs at the time of manufacture whereas others list the number through the expiration date or use-by date. It is worth noting that the number of CFUs in a probiotic can decline over time. Therefore, the number of CFUs that a product contained when it was manufactured does not necessarily reflect the number of CFUs that the product contains when it is purchased or used.

Fact Sheet for Consumers This is a general overview. For more in-depth information, see our health professional fact sheet . What is ashwagandha and what does it do? Ashwagandha is a plant used in traditional Ayurvedic and Unani medicine. It is commonly promoted for sleep, stress, and anxiety as well as cognitive function . Ashwagandha is also known as Withania somnifera , Indian ginseng, and winter cherry. Ashwagandha supplements usually contain extracts made from the plant’s roots or from the roots and leaves. Does ashwagandha work? The health effects of ashwagandha extracts have not been thoroughly studied, but here’s what we have learned from the research so far. Stress and anxiety Ashwagandha extracts might help reduce stress and anxiety. In several studies, people who took ashwagandha for 6 to 8 weeks reported that they felt less stress and anxiety as well as less fatigue and sleeplessness. Ashwagandha also lowered stress hormone levels. In some studies, ashwagandha appeared to be more effective when taken at doses of 500 to 600 milligrams (mg) per day compared with lower doses. Sleep Results from a few small studies suggest that ashwagandha extracts might improve sleep. In these studies, people who had trouble sleeping and took ashwagandha reported that they fell asleep faster, slept longer, and woke up less often during the night. Overall, the benefits for sleep were small, but ashwagandha seemed most helpful when taken at doses of 600 mg per day or more for at least 8 weeks. Is ashwagandha safe? In the studies described above, there were no safety concerns when people used ashwagandha extracts for up to about 3 months.

However, making these lifestyle changes isn’t easy, so you might wonder if taking a dietary supplement that’s promoted for weight loss might help. This fact sheet describes what’s known about the safety and effectiveness of many ingredients that are commonly used in weight-loss dietary supplements . Sellers of these supplements might claim that their products help you lose weight by blocking the absorption of fat or carbohydrates, curbing your appetite, or speeding up your metabolism . However, there’s little scientific evidence that weight-loss supplements work. Many are expensive, some can interact or interfere with medications, and a few might be harmful. If you’re thinking about taking a dietary supplement to lose weight, talk with your health care provider. This is especially important if you have high blood pressure , diabetes , heart disease, liver disease, or other medical conditions. What are the ingredients in weight-loss dietary supplements?

Caffeine Caffeine Caffeine is a stimulant that can make you more alert, give you a boost of energy, burn calories, and increase fat breakdown. Often added to weight-loss dietary supplements, caffeine is found naturally in tea, guarana, kola (cola) nut, yerba mate, and other herbs. The labels of supplements that contain caffeine don't always list it, so you might not know if a supplement has caffeine. Does it work? Weight-loss dietary supplements with caffeine might help you lose a little weight or gain less weight over time. When you use caffeine regularly, however, you become tolerant of it. This tolerance might lessen any effect of caffeine on body weight over time. Is it safe? Caffeine is safe for most adults at doses up to 400‒500 milligrams (mg) a day, but it can make you feel nervous, jittery, and shaky. It can also affect your sleep. At higher doses, it can cause nausea, vomiting, rapid heartbeat, and seizures. Combining caffeine with other stimulant ingredients can increase caffeine's effects. Calcium Calcium Calcium is a mineral you need for healthy bones, muscles, nerves, blood vessels, and many of your body's functions. It's claimed to burn fat and decrease fat absorption. Does it work? Calcium—either from food or in weight-loss dietary supplements—probably doesn't help you lose weight or prevent weight gain. Is it safe? Calcium is safe at the recommended amounts of 1,000 to 1,200 mg a day for adults.

Vitamin D Vitamin D Your body needs vitamin D for good health and strong bones. People who are obese tend to have lower levels of vitamin D, but there is no known reason why taking vitamin D would help people lose weight. Does it work? Vitamin D doesn't help you lose weight. Is it safe? Vitamin D from foods and dietary supplements is safe at the recommended amounts of 15‒20 mcg (600‒800 International Units [IU]) a day for adults. Too much vitamin D (more than 100 mcg [4,000 IU] a day) can be toxic and cause nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and irregular heartbeat.

FDA is the federal agency that oversees dietary supplements in the United States. Unlike over-the-counter and prescription drugs —which must be approved by FDA before they can be sold—dietary supplements don’t require review or approval by FDA before they are put on the market. Also, manufacturers don’t have to provide evidence to FDA that their products are safe or effective before selling these products. When FDA finds an unsafe dietary supplement, it can remove the supplement from the market or ask the supplement maker to recall it.

For more in-depth information, see our health professional fact sheet . What are dietary supplements for exercise and athletic performance and what do they do? If you get regular exercise—and especially if you're an athlete and compete in sporting events—you know that a nutritionally adequate diet and plenty of fluids are important for maximizing your physical performance. You may wonder, however, if dietary supplements could help you train harder, improve performance, or gain a competitive edge. This fact sheet describes what's known about the effectiveness and safety of many ingredients in dietary supplements that are promoted to improve exercise and athletic performance. These products are sometimes called ergogenic aids, but this fact sheet simply refers to them as performance supplements. Sellers of these supplements might claim that their products improve strength or endurance, help you achieve a performance goal more quickly, or increase your tolerance for more intense training. They might also claim that their supplements can help prepare your body for exercise, reduce the chance of injury during training, or assist with recovery after exercise. Performance supplements cannot substitute for a healthy diet, but some of them may have value, depending on the type and intensity of your activity. Other supplements don't seem to work, and a few might be harmful. If you're thinking about taking a performance supplement, talk to your health care provider. If you have a trainer or coach with knowledge of sports medicine, ask them about performance supplements. Talking to an expert is important if you're a teenager or have any medical conditions. It's also important to find out whether medications you take might interact with the performance supplements you're considering.

These products are sold in various forms, such as capsules , tablets, liquids, and powders. This fact sheet describes ingredients in performance supplements below in alphabetical order. You'll learn whether each ingredient is effective and safe and get expert advice about using it. Keep in mind, however, that many performance supplements in the marketplace contain more than one ingredient, and ingredients can work differently when they're combined. Because most ingredient combinations have not been studied, we don't know how effective or safe they are in improving performance. You may be surprised to learn that makers of performance supplements usually don't carry out studies in people to find out whether their products really work and are safe. When studies on performance supplement ingredients and ingredient combinations are done (mainly by researchers at colleges and universities), they often involve small numbers of people taking the supplement for just a few days, weeks, or months. Much of the research is done in young healthy men, but not women, middle-aged and older adults, or teenagers. And often, studies haven't looked at the use of supplement ingredients or combinations in people involved in the same athletic activity as you. For example, the results from a study in weightlifters might not apply to you if you are a distance runner. Ingredients in supplements for exercise and athletic performance INGREDIENT DOES IT WORK? IS IT SAFE? BOTTOM LINE Antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, and coenzyme Q10) Antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, and coenzyme Q10) You breathe in more oxygen when you exercise. As a result, free radicals form and damage muscle cells.",natural_remedy
nih_ods_0049_3,Dietary Supplements for Exercise and Athletic Performance,NIH Office of Dietary Supplements,https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/ExerciseAndAthleticPerformance-Consumer/,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Because antioxidants can reduce free-radical damage to muscle, some people think that taking them in a supplement might reduce muscle inflammation, soreness, and fatigue. Does it work? No. The free radicals that form when you exercise seem to help muscle fibers grow and produce more energy. Antioxidant supplements might actually reduce some of the benefits of exercise, including muscle growth and power output. Also, they have little effect on aerobic fitness and performance in endurance activities like distance running. Is it safe? Everyone needs adequate amounts of vitamin C and vitamin E for good health. Getting too much of these nutrients can be harmful, but the amounts of vitamin C (about 1,000 milligrams) and vitamin E (about 500 International Units [IU]) typically used in studies of performance supplements are below safe upper limits. The side effects from coenzyme Q10 can include tiredness, insomnia, headaches, and some gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort, but these effects tend to be mild. Bottom Line There’s little scientific evidence to support taking supplements containing vitamins C and E or coenzyme Q10 to improve performance if you’re getting adequate amounts of these nutrients from a nutritious diet. Bottom Line : There’s little scientific evidence to support taking supplements containing vitamins C and E or coenzyme Q10 to improve performance if you’re getting adequate amounts of these nutrients from a nutritious diet. Arginine Arginine Arginine is an amino acid in foods that contain protein, like meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, and legumes. A nutritious diet supplies about 4 to 5 grams a day. Supplement sellers claim that taking larger amounts of arginine in supplements improves performance, partly because the body converts it into nitric oxide, which expands blood vessels and increases blood flow.",natural_remedy

Although the research is limited, arginine supplements seem to have little to no effect on strengthening and muscle-building exercises (like bodybuilding) or aerobic activities (like running and cycling). Studies have used 2 to 20 grams a day of arginine for up to 3 months. Is it safe? Arginine supplements seem safe when users take up to 9 grams a day for several days or weeks. Taking more can cause GI discomfort and can slightly lower blood pressure.

Bottom Line : There’s little scientific evidence to support taking arginine supplements to increase strength, improve performance, or help tired and sore muscles recover after exercise. Beetroot or beet juice Beetroot or beet juice Beets and beet juice are among the best food sources of nitrate. Beet juice might improve athletic performance because the body converts some of this nitrate to nitric oxide, which expands blood vessels. This blood vessel expansion increases blood flow and the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to exercising muscle. The expanded blood vessels also speed up the removal of waste products that cause muscle fatigue. Does it work? Many, but not all, studies have found that beet juice can improve performance and endurance in aerobic activities like running, swimming, cycling, and rowing, but whether it helps with strengthening and bodybuilding exercises isn’t known.

Beta-alanine Beta-alanine Beta-alanine is an amino acid in foods such as meat, poultry, and fish. People get up to about 1 gram a day of beta-alanine, depending on their diet. Your body uses beta-alanine to make carnosine in skeletal muscles. When you exercise intensely for several minutes, your muscles produce lactic acid, which reduces muscular force and causes tiredness. Carnosine reduces the buildup of lactic acid. Beta-alanine supplements increase muscle carnosine levels by different amounts, depending on the person. Does it work? Some, but not all, studies have shown that beta-alanine produces small performance improvements in swimming and team sports, like hockey and football, that require high-intensity, intermittent effort over short periods. Whether beta-alanine helps with endurance activities like cycling isn’t clear. It’s also not clear whether beta-alanine mainly benefits trained athletes or recreational exercisers. In most studies, participants took 1.6 to 6.4 grams a day of beta-alanine for 4 to 8 weeks. Is it safe? Taking 800 milligrams or more beta-alanine can cause moderate to severe paresthesia, a tingling, prickling, or burning sensation in your face, neck, back of the hands, and upper trunk. This effect can last 60 to 90 minutes but is not considered serious or harmful.

Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) Your body converts a small amount of leucine, one of the amino acids in foods and protein powders, to HMB. Your liver then converts the HMB into another compound that experts think helps muscle cells restore their structure and function after exercise. HMB also helps build protein in muscle and reduces muscle-protein breakdown. Does it work? It’s hard to know whether you might benefit from using HMB supplements because the research on these supplements has included adults of very different ages and fitness levels who took widely varying doses for different amounts of time. Overall, HMB seems to speed up recovery from exercise that’s intense enough and long enough to cause muscle damage. Therefore, if you’re a trained athlete, you’ll need to exert yourself more than recreationally active people to cause the muscle damage that HMB might help treat. Is it safe?

Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) The amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine are known as BCAAs. Animal foods, like meat, fish, and milk, contain BCAAs. Your muscles can use these three amino acids to provide energy during exercise. Leucine might also help build muscle. Does it work? There’s little evidence that BCAA supplements improve performance in endurance activities like distance running. BCAA supplements might help increase your muscle size and strength together with a weight-training program, but it isn’t clear whether taking BCAA supplements will help you build more muscle than just eating enough high-quality protein foods. Is it safe? A nutritious diet with enough protein can easily provide 10 to 20 grams a day of the BCAAs. Taking up to another 20 grams a day of BCAAs in supplements seems to be safe.

It improves your body’s response to athletic training and helps shorten the time you need to recover after exercise. Protein is made from amino acids. Your body makes some amino acids but needs to get others (known as essential amino acids [EAAs]) from food. Animal foods like meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products contain all of the EAAs. Plant foods like grains and legumes contain different EAAs, so eating a diet containing different types of plant-based foods is one way to get all EAAs. Most protein powders and drinks contain whey, a protein in milk that provides all the EAAs. Does it work? Adequate protein in your diet provides the EAAs necessary for making muscle proteins and reduces the breakdown of proteins in your muscles. Athletes need about 0.5 to 0.9 grams of protein per pound of body weight a day (or about 75 to 135 grams for a person weighing 150 pounds).

This page has resources to help answer your questions about flu vaccines. Prevention steps and strategies Take time to get a flu vaccine. Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine every season, especially people at higher risk . CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccine as the first and most important action in reducing your risk of flu and its potentially serious outcomes. For 2025-2026 flu season , CDC recommends seasonal flu vaccination for children, pregnant women, and adults with only single-dose formulations of flu vaccine that are free of thimerosal as a preservative. Flu vaccines help to reduce the burden of flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths on the health care system each year. (Read more about flu vaccine benefits .) Flu vaccination also has been shown to reduce the severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick. All flu vaccines are designed to protect against three influenza viruses (Visit Vaccine Virus Selection for this season's vaccine composition.) Everyone 6 months and older should get an annual flu vaccine, ideally by the end of October but people should continue to get vaccinated as long as flu viruses pose a threat to their community. Vaccination of people at higher risk of developing serious flu complications is especially important to decrease their risk of severe flu illness. People at higher risk of serious flu complications include young children , pregnant women , people with certain chronic health conditions like asthma , diabetes or heart and lung disease, and people 65 years and older . Vaccination also is important for health care workers and other people who live with or care for people at higher risk of serious flu illness to keep from spreading flu to them.",prevention
cdc_0001_2, ,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevention/index.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"This is especially true for people who work in long-term care facilities, which are home to many of the people most vulnerable to flu. Children younger than 6 months are at higher risk of serious flu illness but are too young to be vaccinated. People who care for infants should be vaccinated instead. Health care providers can support patients in making informed decisions about vaccinations. Take everyday preventive actions to stop the spread of germs. Take actions every day to help stop the spread of germs. Getting a flu vaccine is the most important. Take other preventive actions in addition to vaccination that may help reduce the spread of viruses like flu. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. If you are sick, limit contact with others as much as possible to keep from infecting them. For flu , CDC recommends that people stay home, for at least 24 hours, until both are true: your symptoms are getting better overall, and you have not had fever (and are not using fever-reducing medication). About Preventing Spread of Respiratory Viruses When You're Sick | What To Do If You Get Sick . After these two criteria are met, there are some additional precautions that can be taken to protect others from respiratory illness. These include taking steps for cleaner air and hygiene practices like cleaning frequently touched surfaces. More information is available about core and additional prevention strategies. Cover coughs and sneezes. Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it. Wearing a mask is an additional prevention strategy that you can choose to further protect yourself and others. When worn by a person with an infection, masks reduce the spread of the virus to others. Masks can also protect wearers from breathing in infectious particles from people around them. Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.",prevention

You can improve air quality by bringing in fresh outside air, purifying indoor air, or gathering outdoors. Cleaner air can reduce the risk of exposure to viruses. Treatment Take flu antiviral drugs if your doctor prescribes them. If you are sick with flu, antiviral drugs can be used to treat your illness. Antiviral drugs are different from antibiotics. They are prescription medicines (pills, liquid or an inhaled powder) and are not available over-the-counter. Flu antiviral drugs can make flu illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They may also prevent serious flu complications . For people at higher risk of serious flu illness , treatment with an antiviral drug can mean the difference between having a milder illness and having a very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay. Studies show that flu antiviral drugs work best for treatment when they are started within 2 days of getting sick, but starting them later can still be helpful, especially if the sick person is at higher risk of severe flu illness or is very sick from flu. If you are at higher risk of severe flu illness and get flu symptoms, call your health care provider early so you can be treated with flu antivirals if needed. Follow your doctor's instructions for taking this drug. Flu symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Some people also may have vomiting and diarrhea. People may be infected with influenza virus and have respiratory symptoms without a fever.

A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Anyone who eats undercooked or raw fish or squid is at risk. You can prevent getting anisakiasis by not eating raw or undercooked fish or squid. Overview Anisakiasis (also known as herring worm disease) is a parasitic disease caused by nematodes (worms) that attach to the walls of the esophagus, stomach, or intestine. Anisakiasis is most commonly found in areas where eating raw fish is popular, such as Japan. Because eating undercooked fish is becoming more common, there have been cases in the US, Europe, South America, and other areas of the world. Signs and symptoms People with anisakiasis can experience signs and symptoms such as Abdominal pain Nausea Vomiting Abdominal distention (abnormal abdominal expansion) Diarrhea Blood and mucus in stool Mild fever People can also experience allergic reactions such as Rashes Itching Infrequently anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction) Some people experience a tingling sensation during or after eating raw or undercooked fish or squid. This sensation is actually the worm moving in the mouth or throat. People can often take the worm out of their mouth themselves or cough it up to prevent infection. Some people experience vomiting, which can often expel the worm from the body. How it spreads When certain infected marine mammals (e.g., whales or sea lions) defecate (poop) in the sea, they release eggs. These eggs become infective larvae while in the water. Crustaceans (e.g., crabs, lobsters, shrimps) consume the infective larvae, and then fish or squid consume the crustaceans. When humans eat raw or undercooked infected fish or squid, they consume the nematode larvae, which can invade the gastrointestinal tract. Eventually, the parasite dies and produces an inflamed mass in the esophagus, stomach, or intestine.",condition

Symptoms can include diarrhea and abdominal pain. You can get balantidiasis by consuming food or water contaminated with infective feces. Overview Balantidium coli is an intestinal protozoan parasite that causes the infection called balantidiasis. While this type of infection is uncommon in the United States, humans and other mammals can become infected with Balantidium coli by ingesting infective cysts from food and water that is contaminated by feces. Mostly asymptomatic, Balantidium infection can cause such symptoms as diarrhea and abdominal pain. Balantidium coli infection in humans is rare in the United States. Balantidium coli is found throughout the world, but it is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions and developing countries. Because pigs are an animal reservoir, human infections occur more frequently in areas where pigs are raised, especially if good hygiene is not practiced. Signs and symptoms Most people infected with Balantidium coli experience no symptoms. Balantidium coli infects the large intestine in humans and produces infective microscopic cysts that are passed in the feces, potentially leading to re-infection or infection of others. People compromised immune systems are the most likely to experience more severe signs and symptoms. These include persistent diarrhea, dysentery, abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, and vomiting. If left untreated, perforation of the colon can occur. How it spreads Balantidium coli is transmitted through the fecal-oral route. Humans can become infected by eating and drinking contaminated food and water that has come into contact with infective animal or human fecal matter.",condition

There is no evidence that ticks spread Bartonella infection to people. Cat scratch disease is the most common form of bartonellosis in the United States. Overview Several species of Bartonella bacteria cause disease in people. Infection with any one of these bacteria is referred to broadly as bartonellosis, although some forms of infection also have common names (for example, cat scratch disease). For more information: Bartonella henselae infection (cat scratch disease) Bartonella quintana infection Bartonella bacilliformis infection B. henselae is transmitted by the scratch of domestic or feral cats. Cats can have fleas that carry the bacteria. B. quintana is transmitted by the human body louse. B. bacilliformis is transmitted by bites from infected sand flies. There is no evidence that Bartonella species can be transmitted to people by ticks. Transmission studies with ticks have only used mice and artificial feeding systems which do not demonstrate that a tick can spread bacteria to people or that the bacteria can survive in a tick for any length of time.

Overview Blastocystis is a microscopic parasite found throughout the world. A parasite is an organism (living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. A full understanding of Blastocystis and whether it causes disease in humans is unclear. There are prescription drugs available to treat blastocystosis in people with symptoms. Signs and symptoms Many people with blastocystosis have no symptoms. However, some people who have Blastocystis in their stool (poop) have some of the following symptoms: Watery or loose stools Diarrhea Abdominal pain Anal itching Weight loss Constipation Excess gas In some studies, blastocystosis has also been associated with various skin rashes and hives. How it spreads It is unclear how Blastocystis spreads. However, the number of people infected appears to increase in areas that use unimproved sanitation facilities (when there is no sanitary separation of human waste from human contact). Studies have suggested that risk of infection may increase through: Consuming contaminated food or water. Working at or attending a daycare or childcare facility. Close contact with a wide range of animals. There is little risk of spreading the infection if you practice good personal hygiene, as outlined in the prevention steps.

A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Medication is available to treat capillariasis. Without treatment, the infection can be deadly. Overview Capillariasis is a parasitic infection in humans caused by two species of nematodes (roundworms): Capillaria hepatica (C. hepatica) This infection can lead to hepatitis (liver disease). C. hepatica is rare disease in humans (usually affects rodents and other wild animals). Despite this, there have been human cases reported on all continents except Australia. Capillaria philippinesis (C. philippinesis) This infection can lead to diarrhea and emaciation. C. philippinesis is frequently found in the Philippines (especially the Luzon region) and Thailand. There are occasionally cases reported from other East and Southeast Asian countries. Rarely cases have been reported in Egypt, the Middle East, and Colombia. Signs and symptoms C. hepatica People infected with a single C. hepatica worm or a few worms often have no signs or symptoms. Female worms lay eggs continuously and when infections with multiple worms occur, symptoms can be severe, and may include Hepatitis Anemia Fever Hypereosinophilia Death C. philippinensis When people are first infected with C. philippinensis, they can have the following signs and symptoms: General abdominal pain Diarrhea If the diseases are not treated, later on, people can develop severe disease and experience the following signs and symptoms: Nausea Vomiting Weight loss Death How it spreads C. hepatica C. hepatica can be found in the livers of small rodents, monkeys, and prairie dogs, where it can cause cirrhosis (scarring of the liver). When large carnivores eat these animals, they consume the capillarid eggs, which then pass through their stool (poop).",condition
cdc_0015_2,Capillaria Infection,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/capillaria,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"When the carnivore poops in soil, the eggs become infective in about 30 days, which can then infect other animals and humans. Alternatively, when the infected rodents, monkeys, or prairie dogs die naturally and decompose, eggs from their livers are released into the soil. If humans consume the eggs from the environment, either directly by eating soil (pica) or indirectly through contaminated food or water, the eggs move to the liver and mature to adult worms. C. hepatica can be transmitted human-to-human when eggs are deposited through human feces (poop) into the soil. C. philippinensis C. philippinensis is often found in small, freshwater fish. When humans consume raw or undercooked infected fish, larvae move to the intestine and mature to adult worms. Female worms deposit eggs in the intestine, which are then released through feces. When infected human feces reach freshwater, fish can get infected and the cycle continues. In some cases eggs may hatch within the human intestine, causing hyperinfection (a massive number of adult worms). C. philippinensis is not transmitted from infected humans to other humans; transmission requires the intermediate freshwater fish host. However, adult C. philippinensis worms that grow within the intestine of infected humans can release eggs that hatch into larvae; this could cause hyperinfection in that human host. Left untreated, this can lead to severe disease. Prevention You can take steps to prevent both types of capillariasis: Sanitation and hygiene precautions Use sanitation facilities (toilets and latrines) that are out of reach from animals and will not let feces seep into the water or around food supplies. Wash your hands with soap and warm water after touching or working with soil and before handling food. Teach children the importance of handwashing.

Keep Reading Preventing Cronobacter in Infants Quick facts Fact Until 2024, invasive Cronobacter infection was not on the list of nationally notifiable conditions, and Minnesota and Michigan were the only states that required reporting. Because most states did not require reporting before 2024, rates of Cronobacter infection in the United States are not well understood, and the true number of annual cases is unknown. Listing Cronobacter as a nationally notifiable condition will help us learn more about the true number of cases that occur each year. Evidence 1 suggests Cronobacter infections are most common in infants less than 2 months old and often cause death in this age group. Also, infections among older adults may be more common, although milder, than infections among infants. While cases in older children and adults do occur, these cases are not nationally notifiable, and therefore are not currently collected in routine surveillance. Around 20% of infants with meningitis or bloodstream infections due to Cronobacter in the United States have died 2 . Worldwide, approximately 40% of infants reported to have Cronobacter meningitis or bloodstream infections have died 2 . Typically, CDC receives 2-4 reports of severe Cronobacter infections in infants annually from health departments and has received reports from 32 states. From January 2002 to July 2022, CDC received 76 reports of severe Cronobacter illnesses among infants.

Many people carrying the parasite have no symptoms, but gut-related symptoms have been associated with this parasite in some people. Infection is common in the United States and globally. Resource‎ Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Dientamoeba fragilis page. Signs and symptoms Many people have no symptoms. If symptoms are present, the most common are diarrhea and/or abdominal pain. Other symptoms can include loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Causes It is unclear how D. fragilis spreads. Most likely, people get infected by accidentally swallowing the parasite; this is called fecal-oral transmission. This could be through contaminated food or water, person-to-person, or animal fecal (poop) contact. The D. fragilis parasite is fragile and cannot live very long in the environment (after it passes in feces) or in stomach acid (after it is swallowed). Prevention To prevent infection with D. fragilis , Wash your hands with soap and water after using the toilet, after changing diapers, and before preparing or eating food. Teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection. Diagnosis Your healthcare provider can take a stool (poop) sample and examine it for D. fragilis infection.",condition

Overview Dibothriocephalus latu s, and related species (belonging to the family Diphyllobothriidae, also called fish or broad tapeworms), are the largest tapeworms to infect people. They can grow to up to 30 feet long. Most people infected with fish tapeworms have no symptoms. However, complications can include intestinal obstruction (blockages in the intestines) and gall bladder disease. This happens when the segments of the tapeworm (called proglottids) move or migrate in the body. Several different Diphyllobothriid species infect humans.

A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. The disease affects communities in remote parts of Africa that do not have safe water to drink. There is no treatment nor a vaccine for Guinea worm disease. Overview Dracunculiasis, also known as Guinea worm disease (GWD), is an infection caused by the parasite Dracunculus medinensis. GWD is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) transmitted to people mostly by consuming unsafe water. Unfiltered drinking water from ponds or other stagnant surface water sources can contain near-microscopic crustaceans called copepods (tiny ""water fleas"") that are infected with Guinea worm larvae (immature forms of the Guinea worm). Signs and symptoms People do not usually have GWD symptoms until about one year after infection. Then, a mature pregnant female worm full of larvae creates a blister on the skin through which she will emerge and expel her larvae when she comes in contact with water. A few days to hours before the worm, which can measure up to 3 feet (1 meter) in length, comes out of the skin, a person may develop fever, swelling, and pain in the area. Most worms come out of people's legs and feet, though worms can come out of other body parts, too. Challenges People in remote rural communities who have GWD often lack access to healthcare. When the adult female worm comes out of the skin, it can be very painful, disabling, and take a long time to remove. The emerging worm can cause a wound that may develop a secondary infection. People at risk Anyone who consumes drinking water from a pond or other stagnant water source contaminated with infected copepods is at risk for infection. People's risk for disease can vary. People do not get immunity after GWD, which means they can get it again. GWD transmission also has a seasonal pattern.",condition
cdc_0024_2,Dracunculus medinensis Infection,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/guinea-worm/about/,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"How it spreads Water contact triggers the Guinea worm to release a milky white liquid that contains hundreds of thousands of immature larvae into the water. In ponds and other stagnant water sources, these larvae are then consumed by copepods. People might become infected with Guinea worms by consuming unfiltered drinking water from such water sources containing infected copepods. People and animals might also become infected by eating certain aquatic animals (e.g., fish or frogs) that have swallowed infected copepods. People and animals infected with GWD can then spread the disease when the worm matures and is ready to emerge from the body if they enter ponds and other stagnant water sources that others drink from. Prevention Guinea worm is a disease that has been prioritized for eradication by the World Health Organization. There were an estimated 3.5 million Guinea worm cases occurring annually in 20 African and Asian countries in 1986, but today, through the Guinea Worm Eradication Program (GWEP), only a handful of countries continue to have the disease. GWEP undertakes several water-related and other measures to prevent GWD: Surveillance and case containment Safe water practices, including distribution of cloth and pipe filters to remove copepods, and advocacy for installation or rehabilitation of safe drinking water supplies like borehole wells Vector control Health education and community mobilization Quick facts There were 14 human GWD cases reported in 2023 in Chad, South Sudan, Mali, Cameroon, and Central African Republic. There were 714 animal GWD infections reported in 2023, which is a slight increase compared to 2022 following expanded surveillance activities. WHO has certified 200 countries free from Guinea worm.

High Lp(a) levels run in families. Current treatments for high Lp(a) are limited. What it is High levels of lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a), pronounced “L-P-little-A”) increase your likelihood of having a heart attack, a stroke, and aortic stenosis, especially if you have familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or signs of coronary heart disease. Cholesterol travels through the blood on lipoproteins, which are made of protein and fat. Lipoproteins include low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and Lp(a). Effects High Lp(a) levels increase your likelihood of having a heart attack or stroke, especially if you have FH or signs of coronary heart disease. This is because: Like LDL-cholesterol, Lp(a)-cholesterol can build up in the walls of your blood vessels. This is more likely this is to happen if you have higher Lp(a) levels. These cholesterol deposits, called plaques, can decrease blood flow to your heart, brain, kidneys, lungs, legs, and other parts of your body. Plaques can grow over time or suddenly rupture, blocking blood vessels and leading to heart attacks or strokes. 1 Lp(a) can cause increased clotting, which can lead to rapidly formed blockages in blood vessels. 1 Lp(a) promotes inflammation which increases the likelihood that plaques will rupture. Because of its role in inflammation, high Lp(a) can also lead to narrowing of the aortic valve, called aortic stenosis. 1 Chronic inflammation leads to calcium build up on the valve, causing stiffness. This can result in reduced blood flow if the valve is unable to open completely. In some cases, people with aortic stenosis need surgery or a procedure to replace the aortic valve.

Lp(a) is not routinely included when you get your cholesterol checked. Your healthcare provider has to order the blood test for Lp(a) separately. About a third of people with FH also have high Lp(a) levels, and current recommendations state that people with FH should have their Lp(a) level checked. Treatment Lp(a) levels cannot be controlled by healthy eating and exercising. Lipoprotein apheresis is the only therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating high Lp(a) levels, and it is only approved for people with FH who have LDL≥100 mg/dL, Lp(a)≥60 mg/dL, and coronary or other artery disease.",condition

The taxonomic position of this group has been debated and revised repeatedly; historically, they were considered protozoa and often remain managed by diagnostic parasitology laboratories. Microsporidia are characterized by the production of resistant spores that vary in size (usually 1—4 µm for medically-important species). They possess a unique organelle, the polar tubule or polar filament, which is coiled inside the spore as demonstrated by its ultrastructure. Microsporidia also possess degenerated mitochondria called mitosomes and lack a conventional Golgi apparatus. To date, more than 1400 species belonging to over 200 genera have been described as parasites infecting a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. There are at least 15 microsporidian species that have been identified as human pathogens; the vast majority of cases being caused by Enterocytozoon bieneusi, followed by some Encephalitozoon species ( E. cuniculi, E. hellem , E. intestinalis ( =Septata intestinalis )). Other less frequently reported agents include members of the genera Anncaliia (= Brachiola ) ( A. algerae , A. connori, A. vesicularum ), Microsporidium ( M . ceylonensis , M. africanum ), Trachipleistophora ( T. hominis, T. anthropophthera ), Nosema ocularum , Pleistophora ronneafiei , Vittaforma corneae (= Nosema corneae ), Tubulinosema acridophagus , and an unknown species likely belonging to Endoreticulatus .",condition
cdc_0032_2,Microsporidia Infection,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/microsporidiosis/index.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Life Cycle View Larger The infective form of microsporidia is the resistant spore, which can persist in the environment for months The spore then germinates, rapidly everting its polar tubule which contacts the eukaryotic host cell membrane . The spore then injects the infective sporoplasm into the host cell through the polar tubule . Inside the cell, the sporoplasm enters the proliferative phase marked by extensive multiplication via merogony (binary fission or multiple fission), creating meronts . The location of this developmental stage within the host cell varies by genus; it can occur either in direct contact with the host cell cytosol ( Enterocytozoon, Nosema ), inside a parasitophorous vacuole of unknown origin ( Encephalitozoon ), in a parasite-secreted envelope ( Pleistophora, Trachipleistophora ), or surrounded by the host cell endoplasmic reticulum ( Endoreticulatus, Vittaforma ) . Following the proliferative phase, meronts undergo sporogony in which the thick spore wall and invasion apparatus develop, creating sporonts and eventually mature spores when all organelles are polarized. When the spores increase in number and completely fill the host cell cytoplasm, the cell membrane is disrupted and spores are released to the surroundings . These free mature spores can infect new cells thus continuing the cycle. Mature spores of intestinal-localizing species may be shed in feces, although the route of transmission remains uncertain for many species. Exposure to spores in water or in soil appears to be a potentially major route, based on the finding of spores in these sources along with case histories. E. bieneusi and V. corneae have been identified in surface waters, and spores of Nosema sp. (and likely A. algerae ) have been identified in ditch water.

Enterocytozoon bieneusi is generally considered a human parasite, but has been detected in swine, primates, cattle, cats, dogs, and several other mammals. Some, but not all, of these animal-derived strains appear to represent zoonotic genotypes. Encephalitozoon cuniculi is endemic in several captive and wild rabbit populations. It has also occasionally been found in domestic dogs, cats, foxes, captive monkeys, and mink. Birds, especially psittacines (parrots, parakeets, love birds, budgerigars, etc.), may represent reservoirs for Encephalitozoon hellem . Unlike the other two important members of the genus, E. intestinalis is only rarely identified in animals other than humans. The host range of the other microsporidia known to infect humans is not as well known. No animal reservoir has been identified for Vittaforma cornea.

Historically it has been observed in severely immunocompromised persons, particularly among persons with AIDS, however the implementation of effective anti-retroviral therapies has reduced the incidence in this group considerably. Cases are also known to occur in immunocompetent individuals.",condition

The most widely used staining technique is the Chromotrope 2R method or its modifications. This technique stains the spore and the spore wall a bright pinkish red. Often, a darker-staining equatorial band is seen in the middle of the spore. This technique, however, is lengthy and time consuming and requires about 90 min.",condition

The spores stain dark violet and the equatorial band is enhanced. In some cases dark staining Gram positive granules are also clearly seen. Chemofluorescent agents such as Calcofluor white are also useful in the quick identification of spores in fecal smears. The spores measure from 0.8 to 1.4 µm in the case of Enterocytozoon bieneusi , and 1.5 to 4 µm in Anncaliia algerae , Encephalitozoon spp., Vittaforma corneae , and Nosema spp. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is still the gold standard and is necessary for the identification of the microsporidian species, which is based on internal features of the spore such as the number of polar tubule coils. However, TEM is expensive, time consuming, and not feasible for routine diagnosis. Immunofluorescence Assays (IFA) IFAs are available for microsporidia using monoclonal and/or polyclonal antibodies. Molecular Methods (PCR) The CDC offers molecular identification of Enterocytozoon bieneusi , Encephalitozoon intestinalis , Encephalitozoon hellem and Encephalitozoon cuniculi using species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Molecular identification of other microsporidia species can be attempted using genera-specific primers and sequencing analysis on a case-by-case basis.

It is often called the ""brain-eating ameba"" because it can infect the brain and destroy brain tissue. Brain infections caused by Naegleria fowleri are very rare but nearly always fatal. Overview Naegleria fowleri lives in soil and warm freshwater lakes, rivers, ponds, and hot springs around the world. In very rare cases, Naegleria fowleri has been found in poorly maintained swimming pools, splash pads, and other recreational venues. The ameba also has been found in tap water. If water containing the ameba goes up the nose and to the brain, it can cause an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Typically, fewer than 10 people a year in the United States get PAM. Nearly everyone who gets PAM dies from it. Between 1962 and 2024, there were 167 reported cases of PAM in the United States. Only four have survived. Naegleria fowleri infects people by traveling up the nose and to the brain (shown here) where it consumes brain tissue. Photo: Dr. James Roberts, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta Signs and symptoms Early symptoms of PAM can include headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting. PAM progresses rapidly. Most people with PAM die within 1 to 18 days after symptoms begin. It usually leads to coma and death after 5 days. As PAM progresses, symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, and hallucinations. Keep Reading Symptoms of Naegleria fowleri Infection Exposure risks Brain infections caused by Naegleria fowleri usually occur after someone goes swimming or diving in a lake, river, or other fresh water during summer months.

Keep Reading What Causes Naegleria fowleri Infection Reducing risk To help protect yourself against a Naegleria fowleri infection: Hold your nose or wear a nose clip if you are jumping or diving into fresh water. Always keep your head above water in hot springs. Don't dig in shallow water because the ameba is more likely to live there. Use distilled or boiled tap water when rinsing your sinuses or cleansing your nasal passages. Keep Reading How to Prevent Naegleria fowleri Infection When Rinsing Sinuses or Nasal Passages Diagnosis A Naegleria fowleri infection is diagnosed using laboratory tests. These tests are available in only a few labs in the United States, including CDC. Because these infections are so rare and hard to detect, diagnosis sometimes happens after a person has died. Contact a healthcare provider immediately if you or a loved one is experiencing symptoms of PAM. Treatment and recovery Naegleria fowleri can cause PAM which destroys brain tissue and causes the brain to swell. Unfortunately, more than 97% of people with PAM have died from the infection.

It can affect the lungs, brain, and skin. Nocardiosis is most common in people with weakened immune systems. The disease is treated with commonly available antibiotics. The infection can prove fatal in as many as 4 out of 10 cases. More Information For Everyone Health Care Providers Overview Nocardiosis is a disease caused by bacteria found in soil. It can affect the lungs, brain, and skin. While the disease can be treated with commonly available antibiotics, it can be fatal in 4 out of 10 cases. In the United States, about 500-1,000 new cases of nocardiosis occur every year. About 6 in 10 people who get nocardiosis have weakened immune systems. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of nocardiosis can be different depending on which part of your body is affected. Nocardiosis usually affects the lungs. If your lungs are infected, you can experience: Fever Weight loss Night sweats Cough Chest pain Pneumonia If you get a lung infection from nocardia, the infection can spread to your brain. If your central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) is infected, you can experience: Headache Weakness Confusion Seizures Nocardiosis and skin infections You can get a skin infection when soil containing Nocardia bacteria gets into open wounds or cuts in your skin. Farming or gardening without gloves and protective clothing increases the risk of cuts, thorn pricks, or other minor injuries. If your skin is infected, you can develop skin ulcers or shallow sores. You might also have nodules, which are growths beneath the surface of the skin. Sometimes, the nodules drain when the infection spreads to your lymph nodes. People at risk People who have had an organ transplant and people with very weak immune systems have a higher risk for nocardiosis Several diseases and conditions can cause people's immune systems to be weak.",condition

In fact, for every woman who gets nocardiosis, there are about 3 men who get the disease. How it spreads Nocardiosis is a disease caused by a type of bacteria called Nocardia that is found in the environment. It's typically in standing water, decaying plants, and soil. Nocardia and other related bacteria are considered opportunistic germs. These are bacteria that infect people and animals when the conditions are right. They can cause severe infections in people with weakened immune systems who have difficulty fighting off infections. People with cancer or those taking certain medications like steroids could have weakened immune systems. Infection occurs when: Someone breathes in dust that contains the bacteria Soil or water carrying nocardia bacteria gets into the skin through a cut A hospitalized patient gets the bacteria in their surgery wound via contaminated medical equipment Nocardiosis can show up in the body as a skin or lung infection. It can also occur as an infection that has spread throughout the body (disseminated infection). In the United States, nocardiosis most often shows up as a lung infection. No matter the cause, nocardiosis needs to be treated. If not, it can spread to other parts of the body, including the spinal cord and the brain. The brain is the most common site of disseminated infection. Fact‎ More than 8 in 10 of patients die after developing nocardiosis of the brain or spinal cord. The risk for death is much higher for patients with very weak immune systems. Prevention If you have a weakened immune system, you should take certain precautions when working in the soil: Wear shoes and gloves.",condition
cdc_0035_3,Nocardia Infection,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/nocardiosis/about/index.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Wear clothing covering your skin Bandage open wounds and cuts. If you have had an organ transplant, you might be given antibiotics to prevent bacterial infections. Some studies have shown this might prevent nocardiosis. Outbreaks of nocardiosis in hospitals are rare. A few outbreaks have been linked to other patients and healthcare workers. One outbreak occurred from the release of bacteria in the air during hospital construction work. Hospitals maintain strong infection control practices to avoid outbreaks of nocardiosis. Diagnosis Talk to your doctor if‎ you have an injury that won't heal or you're having nocardiosis symptoms. You should also tell your doctor how you were wounded. That information helps with getting a correct diagnosis and the best treatment. Your healthcare provider can help you find out if you have nocardiosis by performing tests that look for the bacteria. Your healthcare provider may need to take samples from an infected part of your body. For example: Lungs Mucus from the lower airways Skin Brain tissue Treatment People with nocardiosis may need to take multiple antibiotics for several months. Sometimes, antibiotic treatment lasts up to a year or more. Longer treatments are meant to prevent symptoms from returning. In addition to treatment, abscesses or wound infections may need to be surgically drained. Some types of Nocardia bacteria are resistant to certain antibiotics. So, laboratory testing is needed to find out which type (species) is causing the infection. Healthcare providers might run tests to find out which antibiotic treatment will stop your infection.

Causes People get paracoccidioidomycosis after breathing in the fungus Paracoccidioides from the environment in certain parts of Mexico and Central and South America. Paracoccidioidomycosis does not spread from person to person. The exact time between inhaling the fungus and getting paracoccidioidomycosis is not known. The specific habitat of the fungus Paracoccidioides is also not exactly known. It has been found in soil near armadillo burrows. Testing and diagnosis Healthcare providers use a patient's symptoms, laboratory tests, and imaging tests, such as a chest X-ray, to diagnose paracoccidioidomycosis. A healthcare provider will often perform a biopsy (take a small sample from the body part that is affected). The sample is sent to a laboratory for a fungal culture or to be examined under the microscope. A blood test can also help diagnose paracoccidioidomycosis. Treatment and recovery Paracoccidioidomycosis is treated with antifungal medicines such as itraconazole and amphotericin B. While antibiotic medicines are made to kill bacteria and not fungi, an antibiotic medicine called trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) can help treat infections. TMP/SMX is also known as co-trimoxazole and by several different brand names, including Bactrim, Septra, and Cotrim. Patients usually need treatment for about one year. Statistics More than 15,000 cases of paracoccidioidomycosis have been recorded since 1930. About 80% of recorded cases have occurred in Brazil. Many more cases likely occur, however, because the disease is underrecognized. Paracoccidioidomycosis is likely rare in the United States, where it is not a reportable disease.

Overview Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a rare, serious lung infection caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii . Most people with PCP have a weakened immune system due to a medical condition, like HIV, or from medication, like corticosteroids. Pneumocystis pneumonia is a risk for people with health conditions. Symptoms The symptoms of PCP can develop over several days or weeks and include: Fever Cough Difficulty breathing Chest pain Chills Fatigue (tiredness) Risk factors Most people who get PCP have weakened immune systems. Some diseases and conditions that increase risk of PCP include: HIV/AIDS (About 30% to 40% of people who get PCP have HIV/AIDS) Chronic lung diseases Cancer Inflammatory diseases or autoimmune diseases (for example, lupus or rheumatoid arthritis) Solid organ or stem cell transplant The other people who get PCP are usually taking medicine (such as corticosteroids) that lowers the body’s ability to fight germs or sickness. How it spreads PCP spreads from person to person through the air. Some healthy adults can carry the Pneumocystis fungus in their lungs without having symptoms. They can spread it to other people, including those with weakened immune systems. Prevention There is no vaccine to prevent PCP.

Other medicines are available for people who cannot take TMP/SMX. Testing Healthcare providers test for PCP by taking a sample of mucus (sputum) from the patient's lungs. Sometimes, a small sample of lung tissue (a biopsy) is used to diagnose PCP or take a blood sample. Samples are analyzed in clinical laboratories. One method that can be used is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which detects PCP DNA. A blood test to detect β-D-glucan (a part of the cell wall of many different types of fungi) can also help diagnose PCP. Treatment and recovery PCP is treated with prescription medication. The most common treatment is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), a medication also known as co-trimoxazole and by several different brand names, i.e. Bactrim, Septra, and Cotrim. This medicine is given by mouth or through a vein for 3 weeks. TMP/SMX can cause side effects such as rash and fever. Other medications are available for patients who cannot take TMP/SMX. Note: Most fungal diseases are treated with antifungal medications. Antibiotics typically are used to treat infections caused by bacteria. Unlike other fungal diseases PCP is treated with an antibiotic and antifungal medications do not work to treat it. Research There is no national surveillance for PCP in the United States. There were 10,590 estimated U.S. hospitalizations due to Pneumocystis pneumonia in 2017. History of HIV and PCP During the 1980s, clusters of PCP were one of the first signs of the HIV/AIDS epidemic emerging in the United States. It became one of the main AIDS-defining illnesses with an estimated three-in-four people living with HIV/AIDS developed PCP. Since then, PCP in people living with HIV has decreased substantially due to antiretroviral therapy and treatment with TMP/SMX.

The most common ways people get sick are from eating or drinking contaminated food or water and contact with someone who is sick or has recently been sick with Shigella infection. Shigella can also be spread during sexual activity with a sick person. More Information For Everyone Health Care Providers Public Health What it is Shigella bacteria cause an infection called shigellosis . Shigella cause an estimated 450,000 infections in the United States each year, and antimicrobial resistant infections result in an estimated $93 million in direct medical costs. The four species of Shigella are: Shigella sonnei (the most common species in the United States) Shigella flexneri Shigella boydii Shigella dysenteriae S. dysenteriae and S. boydii are rare in the United States, though they continue to be important causes of disease in areas with less access to resources. Shigella dysenteriae type 1 can be deadly. Symptoms Symptoms usually start 1–2 days after infection and last 7 days. Most people with shigellosis experience: Diarrhea that can be bloody or prolonged (lasting more than 3 days) Fever Stomach pain Feeling the need to pass stool (poop) even when the bowels are empty Keep Reading: Signs and Symptoms of Shigella Infection Who is at risk Some groups of people are more likely to get sick with shigellosis than others. Children younger than 5 years old are the most likely to get shigellosis, but people of all ages can get the disease. Many outbreaks occur in early care and education settings and schools . Travelers to places where water and food may be unsafe and sanitation is poor are more likely to get a Shigella infection. They are also more likely to become sick with types of Shigella that are more difficult to treat . Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men* (GBMSM) have factors that put them at increased risk for Shigella infection.",condition
cdc_0039_2,Shigella Infection,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/about/index.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Although rates are higher among GBMSM, the risk is present for any sexual activity involving stool exposure. People who are experiencing homelessness are at high risk for Shigella infection when there is shigellosis spread in the community. They may face challenges in their living situations that increase the risk for disease transmission, which can result in outbreaks. How it spreads Shigella spreads easily; swallowing just a small amount of Shigella germs can make you sick. Shigella germs are in poop, so anything that gets contaminated by poop can potentially spread the germs. Shigella can spread from one person to another or through contaminated water, food, surfaces, or objects. Keep Reading: How Shigella Spreads Prevention You can take steps to avoid getting or spreading Shigella. Wash your hands with soap and water at key times . Take care when changing diapers . Avoid swallowing water while swimming. When traveling internationally, follow safe food and water habits and clean your hands often. If you or your partner has been diagnosed with shigellosis , do not have sex for at least two weeks after the diarrhea ends. Keep Reading: Preventing Shigella Infection Treatment and recovery People who have shigellosis usually get better without antibiotic treatment in 5 to 7 days. People with mild shigellosis may need only fluids and rest. Your healthcare provider may prescribe medicine to treat illness caused by Shigella .

Most of the time, staph does not cause any harm, but it can sometimes cause infections. Some types of Staphylococcus aureus are resistant to common antibiotic treatments. Overview Staphylococcus aureus (staph) is a bacterium commonly found on the skin and in the nose of about 30% of individuals. Most of the time staph does not cause any harm, but it can sometimes cause infections. In healthcare settings, infections can lead to serious or fatal outcomes. Signs and symptoms Staph infections can look like pimples, boils or other skin conditions. In healthcare settings, staph infections can be serious or fatal, leading to: Bloodstream infections or sepsis when bacteria get in the bloodstream. Pneumonia , which most often affects people with underlying lung disease, including those on mechanical ventilators. Endocarditis (infection of the heart valves), which can lead to heart failure or stroke. Osteomyelitis (bone infection), caused by staph bacteria traveling in the bloodstream or put there by direct contact such as trauma (puncture wound of the foot). Risk factors In the community, people are at greater risk of staph infections if they have chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, cancer, vascular disease, etc.) or inject drugs.

It can cause stomachaches, diarrhea, and rashes. Most people have no symptoms, but people with immune disorders or taking drugs affecting immunity can get severely ill. Antiparasitic drugs can treat severe cases of strongyloidiasis. Overview Strongyloides is a type of nematode or roundworm parasite. A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. It can infect people through exposed skin, such as bare feet, and cause a disease called strongyloidiasis. Strongyloidiasis can cause stomachaches, diarrhea, and rashes. Most people infected with Strongyloides have no symptoms and may not know they're infected. However, people who have weakened immune systems can become severely ill or die from strongyloidiasis if not treated. Strongyloides is usually found in tropical regions, particularly Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. However, it can occur anywhere, especially in warm, wet, rural areas. The best way to prevent Strongyloides infection is to wear shoes when you are walking on soil, avoid contact with fecal matter or sewage, and clean up after dogs. Use improved sanitation facilities , if available, to ensure people do not have contact with human waste. Signs and symptoms Most people infected with Strongyloides do not have any symptoms.

When did CDC abortion surveillance start? CDC began abortion surveillance in 1969 to document the number and characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions. Many states and jurisdictions conduct abortion surveillance. This information is voluntarily reported as aggregate data to CDC. CDC’s surveillance system compiles the information from states and jurisdictions on legal induced abortions. How does CDC define abortion? For the purpose of surveillance, legal induced abortion is defined as ""an intervention performed within the limits of state and jurisdiction law by a licensed clinician (for instance, a physician, nurse-midwife, nurse practitioner, physician assistant) intended to terminate a suspected or known intrauterine pregnancy and that does not result in a live birth."" This definition excludes management of intrauterine fetal death, early pregnancy failure/loss, ectopic pregnancy, or retained products of conception. Most states and jurisdictions that collect abortion data report whether an abortion was performed by medication or surgery. Are states and jurisdictions required to report their abortion data to CDC? No, states and jurisdictions voluntarily report aggregate data to CDC for inclusion in its annual Abortion Surveillance report. CDC's Division of Reproductive Health prepares surveillance reports as data become available. There is no national requirement for data submission or reporting. States and jurisdictions needing guidance on abortion surveillance may contact CDC at Contact CDC-INFO . How is the report prepared and formatted?

Adenovirus vaccine can prevent infection with some types of adenovirus. Adenoviruses can cause illness that is usually mild, but can be serious in some cases. People with weakened immune systems, or existing lung or heart disease, are at higher risk of developing severe illness from an adenovirus infection. Adenovirus infection can cause: Common cold or flu-like symptoms Fever Sore throat Acute bronchitis (inflammation of the airways of the lungs, sometimes called a ""chest cold"") Pneumonia (infection of the lungs) Diarrhea Conjunctivitis (pink eye) Infection with adenovirus can also rarely lead to more serious problems, such as severe pneumonia or neurologic disease (conditions that affect the brain and spinal cord), and even death. Some people who are infected may have to be hospitalized. Adenoviruses are usually spread from an infected person to others through close personal contact such as touching or shaking hands, through the air by coughing and sneezing, or through handling objects that an infected person has touched. Some adenoviruses can spread through an infected person's stool, for example, during diaper changing. Adenovirus can also spread through the water, such as in swimming pools, but this is less common. Certain adenovirus types (including Type 4 and Type 7) have caused severe outbreaks of respiratory illness among military recruits. Adenovirus vaccine Adenovirus vaccine is only available for United States military personnel. There is currently no adenovirus vaccine available to the general public. Adenovirus vaccine contains live adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7. It will prevent most illness caused by these two virus types.",prevention

The tablets should be swallowed whole, not chewed or crushed. The vaccine is approved for military personnel 17 through 50 years of age. It is recommended by the Department of Defense for military recruits entering basic training. It may also be recommended for other military personnel at high risk for adenovirus infection. Adenovirus vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Talk with your health care provider Tell your vaccine provider if the person getting the vaccine: Has had an allergic reaction after a previous dose of adenovirus vaccine , or has any severe, life-threatening allergies . Has a weakened immune system . Is younger than 17 or older than 50 years . Is pregnant or nursing , or planning to become pregnant. Is unable to swallow the vaccine tablets whole without chewing them. Is currently experiencing vomiting or diarrhea . In some cases, your health care provider may decide to postpone adenovirus vaccination to a future visit. People with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting adenovirus vaccine. Virus from the vaccine can be shed in the stool for up to 28 days after vaccination. To minimize the risk of spreading vaccine virus to other people during this period, observe proper personal hygiene , such as frequent hand washing, especially following bowel movements. This is especially important if you have close contact with children 7 years of age and younger, with anyone having a weakened immune system, or with pregnant women.

An allergic reaction could occur after the vaccinated person leaves the clinic. If you see signs of a severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, or weakness), call 9-1-1 and get the person to the nearest hospital. For other signs that concern you, call your health care provider. Adverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

NIOSH studies how to protect workers from harmful effects of aerosols. NIOSH offers guides and tools to keep workers safe from harmful aerosols. Overview An aerosol can be defined as a suspension of particles or droplets in air. Aerosols may include airborne dusts, mists, fumes, or smoke. Suspended particle sizes may range from a few nanometers (nm) to hundreds of micrometers (µm) in diameter. For comparison a human hair may be between 20 to 180 µm in diameter. Particles can be manufactured or naturally occurring. A welder can potentially be exposed to welding fumes. Aerosols in the workplace may pose both health and safety hazards. Aerosols are encountered across multiple industry sectors. Particles can be inhaled, absorbed by the skin, enter the eyes or be ingested. Factors such as particle size, composition, shape, and concentration, can determine whether particles can cause harm to workers. Harmful effects can be either short or long term. Safety hazards may include slips, fires, or explosions. Research NIOSH has carried out extensive aerosol research in exposure assessment, epidemiology, toxicology, risk mitigation, aerosol sampling and method development. This assists our understanding in: How aerosols are formed and transported through the workplace. Which workers may be most impacted and to what extent. The health implications to workers. The safety implications in the workplace. How to sample for and measure aerosols in the workplace. How to reduce or eliminate the health and safety hazards.

Older workers are a large and growing part of the workforce. An age-friendly workplace benefits all workers, but especially older workers. Overview Aging is a process experienced by all workers. For many older adults, work provides economic security and social interaction, and improves quality of life. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2021 nearly one in four American workers was age 55 or older. Labor force participation rates for older workers are projected to increase through 2030. Participation rates for workers of other age groups are projected to remain relatively level or decline. It is important to support and protect the health and safety of workers, especially those of advanced age. Attributes of productive aging A life-span perspective views aging as an adaptive and dynamic process. Aging impacts your body, your mind, and how you interact with the world around you. Changes that occur as workers age do not take place in a vacuum. In the workplace, the following factors play a role in productive aging: The nature of work and its structure Workplace relationships Work-related events, like career progression and retirement Ageist beliefs that may interfere with support of productive aging Benefits of an aging workforce Aging workers may provide the following benefits to their workplaces: Institutional knowledge Applicable experience Low levels of stress on the job Get along well with their coworkers Cautious on the job Health, safety, and aging Aging affects a variety of health conditions and outcomes, including chronic conditions and the likelihood of workplace injury. Chronic conditions and aging More than 75% of all workers have at least one chronic condition. The two most common health conditions affecting older workers are arthritis and hypertension. Nearly half of workers over age 55 experience at least one of these conditions.",condition
cdc_0062_2,Aging in the Workplace,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/aging/about/,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Since many older workers experience chronic conditions, they may be absent from work. On the other hand, there may be an increase in ""presenteeism."" Presenteeism is when workers show up to work sick. Safety and aging Overall, older workers tend to experience fewer workplace injuries than their younger colleagues. This difference may be due to their experience or because they are more careful and aware of their physical limitations. Older workers often require more time to heal from workplace injuries. It is important for employers to have a well-planned return to work program. Older workers experience a higher rate of workplace fatalities. Employers need to be mindful of how best to adapt the conditions of work to protect workers. They should also explore opportunities for preventative programs that can maintain or build the health of employees through their working life. Recommendations Creating an age-friendly workplace Many age-friendly work practices benefit workers of all ages. Managers can create age-friendly workplaces by: Prioritizing workplace flexibility and matching tasks to abilities. Give workers a say in their schedule and work tasks. Use self-paced work, rest breaks, and less repetitive tasks. Provide reasonable accommodations after illness or injury. Avoid prolonged, sedentary work. Managing hazards like noise, slip/trip hazards, and physical hazards. Providing and designing ergonomic-friendly work environments. Providing health promotion and lifestyle interventions. Investing in training and building worker skills and competencies. Help older employees learn and adapt to new technologies. Providing age-inclusive management training for supervisors.

Particle Pollution (Particulate Matter) Particle pollution , also called particulate matter, is made up of particles (tiny pieces) of solids or liquids in the air. These particles include: Dust Dirt Soot Smoke Drops of liquid Some particles are big enough or dark enough to see, like smoke. Others are so small that you can't see them. Breathing in particle pollution can be harmful to your health. Larger particles, called PM10, irritate the eyes, nose, and throat. Dust from roads, farms, dry riverbeds, construction sites, and mines are types of PM10. Smaller particles, called PM2.5, are more dangerous because they can get into the deep parts of your lungs — or even into your blood.

Learn how to navigate air quality conditions with the Air Quality Index and find other helpful resources available to you. What you can do The Air Quality Index (AQI) Sometimes the air quality outdoors may not be safe for everyone. What can you do? Pay attention to the Air Quality Index (AQI) . The AQI tells you when high levels of air pollution are predicted and how air pollution affects your health. Finding the AQI is easy. It's on the Web, on many local TV weather forecasts, or you can sign up for free e-mail tools or download the AirNow app . Download Air Quality Index scale The AQI is easy to use. If the AQI predicts a ""Code Orange"" (unhealthy for sensitive groups) day don't cancel your plans—use the AQI to help you plan a better time or place for them. The AQI tells you about major air pollutants in the U.S. that are regulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency, including ozone and particle pollution. Ozone and particle pollution may harm the health of hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. Ozone and particle pollution Let's say that the ozone level where you live is predicted to be Code Orange tomorrow. If you're a runner—even if you're healthy—that air quality could hurt you. Using the AQI, you can plan your run for when ozone levels will be lower, shorten your run or walk instead, or run on a treadmill indoors. Particle pollution has been linked to heart attacks and strokes, and even death in people with heart disease. On a day when particle pollution will be at Code Orange, do something less intense. Walk instead of run or do only lighter outdoor work. Use the AQI Wherever You Go Don't forget to check the AQI when you're on vacation or travelling within the U.S. No matter where you go, you can always access the AQI. Check the AQI now!",condition

There is no known safe amount of alcohol use during pregnancy. There is no safe time during pregnancy to drink alcohol. All types of alcohol can be harmful, including red or white wine, beer, and liquor. Why it's important Alcohol use during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, stillbirth, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Alcohol use during pregnancy can cause a range of lifelong behavioral, intellectual, and physical disabilities known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) . During pregnancy, alcohol can pass from the pregnant woman to the fetus and affect its development. Not all babies will be affected by alcohol during pregnancy. However, it is impossible to know which babies will be affected. There is no safe time for alcohol use during pregnancy. Alcohol can cause problems for the baby throughout pregnancy, including before a woman knows she is pregnant. Alcohol use in the first 3 months of pregnancy can cause the baby to have abnormal facial features. Growth and central nervous system problems (for example, low birthweight, behavioral problems) can occur from alcohol use anytime during pregnancy. The baby's brain is developing throughout pregnancy and can be affected by exposure to alcohol at any time. It is never too late to stop alcohol use during pregnancy. Stopping alcohol use will improve the baby's health and well-being. There is no known safe amount of alcohol use during pregnancy. Common questions I just found out I'm pregnant. I've stopped drinking now, but I was drinking in the first few weeks before I knew I was pregnant. What should I do now? The most important thing is that you have completely stopped alcohol use after learning of your pregnancy. It is never too late to stop alcohol use during pregnancy.",condition

Make sure you get regular prenatal checkups. If you used any amount of alcohol while you were pregnant, talk with your child's healthcare provider as soon as possible and share your concerns. I drank wine during my last pregnancy and my baby turned out fine. Why shouldn't I drink again during this pregnancy? Every pregnancy is different. Alcohol use during pregnancy might affect one baby more than another. You could have one child who is born healthy and another child who is born with problems. There is no known safe amount of alcohol use during your pregnancy or when you are trying to get pregnant. There is also no safe time for alcohol use during pregnancy.

Alpha-gal is a molecule found in most mammals, such as cows and pigs, but not in people. People with AGS can have an allergic reaction after eating red meat or being exposed to products containing alpha-gal. The best way to protect yourself and your family from AGS is to prevent tick bites. What is alpha-gal syndrome? Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS) is a serious, potentially life-threatening allergy and tickborne disease. Alpha-gal is a molecule (galactose-α-1,3-galactose) that is naturally produced in the bodies of most mammals but not in people. It is also found in the saliva (spit) of some ticks. When a tick bites, it can transfer alpha-gal from its saliva into a person's blood. The body's natural defenses, or immune system, can identify alpha-gal as a threat and trigger an allergic reaction. Symptoms occur after people eat red meat or are exposed to other products made from mammals . Because of this, AGS is also known as red meat allergy or tick bite meat allergy. View Larger Download In the United States, the lone star tick is most often associated with AGS. A few cases of AGS have been reported following bites from blacklegged and western blacklegged ticks.

Ammonia is a toxic clear gas or liquid. Signs and symptoms of ammonia exposure depend on how you were exposed. If exposed, get away from the area, get clean, and get help. Background Ammonia occurs naturally and is produced by human activity. Ammonia is made up of nitrogen and hydrogen. It is an important source of nitrogen, which is needed by plants and animals. It is widely used in fertilizers and pharmaceuticals. At room temperature, ammonia is a clear, colorless gas. Ammonia can also be a clear, colorless liquid that dissolves in water. Changing ammonia to a liquid can help with its storage and transportation. Ammonia can be recognized by its strong smell, which is like the smell of rotting fish. Ammonia reacts with strong oxidizers, acids, halogens (including chlorine bleach), and salts of silver, zinc, copper, and other heavy metals. Ammonia is also commonly used in a liquid form mixed with water, such as household ammonia. Signs and symptoms Normal amounts of ammonia in the environment do not cause health effects in humans. Exposure to high levels of ammonia may hurt your skin, eyes, throat, and lungs and cause coughing and burns. Lung damage and death may occur after exposure to very high levels of ammonia. Most people will smell the chemical or feel irritation that tells you that you are exposed to ammonia. Exposure for a long time may affect people's ability to sense the chemical. Effects depend on how the person was exposed, how much they were exposed to, and how long they were exposed for. Some people with asthma or other chronic lung diseases may be more sensitive to breathing ammonia than others.",condition

Exposure Warning!‎ Household ammonia can release gas if it is mixed with certain other cleaning products. Do not mix household cleaners! If ammonia is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or breathing in the gas. Ammonia gas is lighter than air, so it will rise. If ammonia is in water, people can be exposed by touching or drinking water that contains ammonia. Ammonia in food Ammonia is unlikely to be eaten or drunk, because it has a very bad smell and taste. Avoid using or eating food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual. Do not eat food that may have touched liquid ammonia if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an unbroken sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected by an ammonia release. Wash the outside of the container before using. Follow any directions by local authorities. What to do if you are exposed Get away Get away from the area where the ammonia was released and breathe fresh air. If the ammonia release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place. Make sure windows are closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the ammonia does not come inside. If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the ammonia was released. If the ammonia release was indoors, get out of the building. If the ammonia release was from household cleaners or chemicals, open windows and doors to let in fresh air. Leave the area until the gas has gone away. If you cannot get away, go to the lowest ground possible because ammonia is lighter than air and will rise.",condition

The bacteria that causes anthrax occurs naturally in soil worldwide. People usually get anthrax from infected animals or contaminated animal products. Call a healthcare provider immediately if you think you have been exposed to anthrax. Overview Anthrax is a serious disease usually caused by Bacillus anthracis bacteria. The bacteria are found naturally in soil around the world and commonly affect livestock and wild animals. People usually get sick with anthrax if they come in contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products. People can breathe in anthrax spores, eat food or drink water contaminated with spores, or get spores in a cut or scrape in the skin. Livestock and wild animals can become infected when they breathe in, eat, or drink spores in contaminated soil, plants, or water. These animals can include cattle, sheep, goats, antelope, and deer. Anthrax is rare in the United States. However, occasional outbreaks do happen in wild and domestic grazing animals such as cattle or deer. In the United States, veterinarians recommend yearly vaccination of livestock in areas where animals have had anthrax in the past. Types The type of illness a person develops depends on how anthrax enters the body: through the skin, lungs, or gastrointestinal system. All types of anthrax can cause death if they're not treated with antibiotics. Cutaneous anthrax Cutaneous anthrax happens when anthrax spores get into a cut or scape on the skin when a person handles infected animals or contaminated animal products like wool, hides, or hair. It mostly shows up on the head, neck, forearms, and hands. It's the most common form of anthrax infection, and it's also considered to be the least dangerous.",condition

Illness or injury may occur if workers’ normal anthropometric measurements are not considered in workplace designs and personal protective equipment. Definitions Anthropometry - the science that defines physical measures of a person's size, form, and functional capacities Functional capacity - the ability to complete certain work tasks based on human size or form How it works Anthropometric measurements are used to study the interaction of workers with tasks, tools, machines, vehicles, and personal protective equipment (PPE). These measurements are often used to determine the degree of protection against dangerous exposures, long term or short term. Many workers experience the benefit of applying anthropometric measurements. For example: Construction workers benefit from more than one size of fall harness. Truck drivers have a more ergonomic design of truck cabs. Firefighters have improved PPE for best fit. Police officers have improved uniform fit for more body types. Consider this Diverse workforces in many occupations require body-size data for designing adequate workplaces, systems, and PPE. Impacts Technological development in recent years has advanced the basic science of human size and shape studies in 3-dimensional (3D) forms. Computer-generated human models are now available for anthropometric analysis. These advances have made it possible to improve workplace and protective equipment design, and anthropometric fit within complex systems. Did you know? In applied anthropometry, collection and use of 3D anthropometric data have become a norm. This will ultimately result in a better fit between workers and their tools, systems, and work environments. Safety risks Designs that are incompatible with normal anthropometric measurements of a workforce may result in unwanted incidents.",condition
cdc_0080_2,Anthropometry,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/anthropometry/about/,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"For example: The misfit of a heavy equipment cabin to a worker may create operator blind spots that expose workers on foot to struck-by injuries. Inadequate length or configuration of seatbelts may lead to non-use of seat belts, which affect post-crash survivability. When PPE does not fit correctly it cannot sufficiently protect workers from health and safety exposures or hazards. What the data shows Existing data on the size and shape of industrial workers is limited. There is a lack of anthropometric data for the general worker population. Safety researchers have generally relied on data drawn from studies of military personnel. Most of these studies took place during the 1950s to 1970s. However, substantial anthropometric variability exists among the general worker population. They are quite different from the average military population. Industrial workers like agricultural, truck driver, and firefighter workforces, are also anthropometrically different from the average civilian population. 1 Resources Datasets Firefighter Anthropometry Datasets U.S. firefighter anthropometric information can be used to update specifications for fire apparatus and firefighter protective equipment.

Among other things, antineoplastic drugs can cause long-term organ damage, fertility issues, and even cancer. Learn about exposure risks and find resources about the dangers of antineoplastic agents. Overview of risk factors The adverse health effects associated with antineoplastic agents (cancer chemotherapy and cytotoxic drugs) in patients are well documented. The very nature of antineoplastic agents makes them harmful to healthy cells and tissues as well as the cancerous cells. Healthcare workers at risk For cancer patients with a life-threatening disease, there is great benefit to treatment with antineoplastic agents. However, for healthcare workers exposed to antineoplastic agents on the job, precautions are important to eliminate or reduce exposure. Pharmacists or nurses who prepare and/or administer these drugs have the highest potential for exposure to antineoplastic agents. Other healthcare workers at risk include: Physicians and operating room personnel. Shipping/receiving, custodial, laundry, and waste workers. Veterinary oncology workers. Health impacts In addition to acute or short-term effects related to treatment with antineoplastic agents, the following long-term or chronic effects have been documented: Liver and kidney damage. Bone marrow damage. Lung and heart damage. Infertility (temporary and permanent). Effects on reproduction and the developing fetus in pregnant women. Hearing impairment. Cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) found a number of antineoplastic agents are associated with cancer in patients. IARC currently lists: Eleven agents and two combined therapies as Group 1 (human carcinogens). Twelve agents as Group 2A (probable human carcinogens). Eleven agents as Group 2B (possible human carcinogens).",condition

In addition, analytical methods, such as measuring the drugs and/or their metabolites in worker urine, help document worker exposure. Worker exposures Some of the following biological endpoints are used to evaluate worker exposure: Urine mutagenicity. Chromosomal damage. Sister chromatid exchange. Micronuclei induction. DNA damage. HPRT mutations. Thioether excretion. Environmental exposures Similar analytical methods measure the level of environmental contamination in the workplace. Although limited studies on air sampling exist, there have been numerous studies published on environmental wipe sampling for these drugs. Preventing exposures In September 2004, The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) published an Alert: Preventing Occupational Exposures to Antineoplastic and Other Hazardous Drugs in Health Care Settings, 2004 , (DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 2004-165) . This topic page is an expanded bibliography of related publications drawn from the published literature related to the Alert.

What it is Aortic aneurysms can dissect or rupture: The force of blood pumping can split the layers of the artery wall, allowing blood to leak in between them. This process is called a dissection . The aneurysm can burst completely, causing bleeding inside the body. This is called a rupture . Dissections and ruptures are the cause of most deaths from aortic aneurysms. A thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest. An abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is more common, happens below the chest. Facts about aortic aneurysm in the United States Aortic aneurysms or aortic dissections were the cause of 9,904 deaths in 2019. 1 In 2019, about 59% of deaths due to aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection happen among men. 1 A history of smoking accounts for about 75% of all abdominal aortic aneurysms. 2 The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men aged 65 to 75 years old who have ever smoked should get an ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms, even if they have no symptoms. 3 Types Thoracic aortic aneurysm A thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest. Men and women are equally likely to get thoracic aortic aneurysms, which become more common with increasing age. 4 Thoracic aortic aneurysms are usually caused by high blood pressure or sudden injury. Sometimes people with inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, get thoracic aortic aneurysms. Signs and symptoms of thoracic aortic aneurysm can include the following: Sharp, sudden pain in the chest or upper back. Shortness of breath. Trouble breathing or swallowing. Abdominal aortic aneurysm An abdominal aortic aneurysm happens below the chest. Abdominal aortic aneurysms happen more often than thoracic aortic aneurysms.",condition
cdc_0085_2,Aortic Aneurysm,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/about/aortic-aneurysm.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common in men and among people age 65 and older. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common among White people than among Black people. 5 Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually caused by atherosclerosis (hardened arteries), but infection or injury can also cause them. 6 Abdominal aortic aneurysms often don't have any symptoms. If an individual does have symptoms, they can include the following: Throbbing or deep pain in the back or side. Pain in the buttocks, groin, or legs. Other types Aneurysms can happen in other parts of your body. A ruptured aneurysm in the brain can cause a stroke . Peripheral aneurysms—those found in arteries other than the aorta—can happen in the neck, in the groin, or behind the knees. These aneurysms are less likely to rupture or dissect than aortic aneurysms, but they can form blood clots. These clots can break away and block blood flow through the artery. Risk factors Diseases and unhealthy behaviors that damage your heart and blood vessels also increase your risk for aortic aneurysm. Smoking is the most important behavior related to aortic aneurysm. Other factors include High blood pressure High blood cholesterol Atherosclerosis (hardened arteries) Some inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, can also increase your risk for aortic aneurysm. Your family may also have a history of aortic aneurysms that can increase your risk. Treatment and recovery The two main treatments for aortic aneurysms are medicines and surgery .

cdc_0087_1,Arsine,CDC,https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/arsine/index.asp,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"September 6, 2024 Arsine Chemical Fact Sheet Key points Arsine is a toxic gas that is colorless, flammable, and non-irritating. Signs and symptoms of arsine poisoning depend on exposure method and dose. If you were exposed, get clean and get medical care. Background Arsine is a colorless, flammable, non-irritating toxic gas with a mild garlic odor. Arsine is formed when arsenic comes in contact with an acid. Arsine is similar to a gas called stibine, which is formed when the metal antimony comes in contact with an acid. Stibine has health effects similar to those of arsine, but it is not as widely available. Stibine also has a noticeable ""rotten egg"" smell. Where it is found Arsine is most commonly used in the semiconductor and metals refining industries. Arsine was studied as a warfare agent during World War II, but it was never used on the battlefield. How it works After arsine enters the bloodstream, it damages the red blood cells. This can lead to symptoms of hemolytic anemia, when red blood cells die faster than the body can replace them. Signs and symptoms The effects of arsine poisoning depend on how much arsine a person was exposed to and how long the exposure was. Depending on the level of exposure to arsine, symptoms are likely to occur within the first 24 hours after exposure. Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to arsine. Exposure to low or moderate dose: Confusion, drowsiness, fatigue, and/or weakness Headache Muscle cramps Nausea, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain Rapid breathing or shortness of breath Red or dark urine Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice) Exposure to a large dose: Convulsions Loss of consciousness Paralysis Respiratory compromise, possibly leading to death Exposure Breathing in the gas is the most likely way of exposure after arsine is released into the air. Arsine is not absorbed into the body through the eyes and the skin.",condition
cdc_0087_2,Arsine,CDC,https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/arsine/index.asp,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"At lower amounts, people may not know they have been exposed to arsine, because it has no smell. At higher amounts, a mild garlic smell (however, do not rely on this as a warning). On the other hand, stibine has a strong smell, so people may notice that they may have been exposed. Most reports of exposure are when arsine is accidentally made in the workplace. Arsine gas is heavier than air, so it would be more likely to settle in lower areas. What to do if you are exposed Because there is no cure for arsine exposure, the best thing to do is avoid it. First, get fresh air by leaving the area where the arsine is. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the possibility of death from arsine. If arsine was released outside, move away from the area. If arsine was released indoors, get out of the building. Evacuate or ""shelter in place"" If you are near an arsine release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or ""shelter in place"" inside.

About asthma Asthma is a lung disease that is caused by chronic inflammation of the airways. It is one of the most common long-term diseases among children, but adults can have asthma, too. Asthma attacks occur when the lung airways tighten due to inflammation. Asthma attacks can be caused by ""triggers"" such as respiratory infections, allergy particles, chemical irritants, and air pollution. During an asthma attack, a person with asthma can experience symptoms such as wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and nighttime or early morning coughing. Often, asthma attacks can be prevented by limiting one's exposure to triggers and by properly using asthma medications. Keep Reading Asthma Flu and people with asthma People with asthma can develop swollen and sensitive airways, and flu can cause further inflammation of the airways and lungs. Flu can trigger asthma attacks and cause worsening of asthma symptoms. Flu also can lead to pneumonia and other acute respiratory diseases.

Work-related asthma is triggered or develops from exposures at work. Workplace irritants, allergens, and physical conditions are triggers. Work-related asthma symptoms are the same as non-work related asthma. Overview Work-related asthma is asthma triggered by exposures at work. Asthma affects the lungs and causes the airways to become narrow and inflamed. To control it, avoid triggers that cause asthma symptoms and take prescribed medicine. Many triggers can be in the workplace. Over 300 known substances in the workplace can cause or worsen asthma. Avoiding triggers can prevent asthma from getting worse. Worsening asthma or new onset asthma in a worker should raise questions about workplace causes. Asthma symptoms can develop shortly after exposure. However, they can also develop months or years after repeated exposures to harmful substances. Signs and symptoms Coughing at work can be a symptom of work-related asthma. Symptoms of work-related asthma are the same as symptoms for non-work-related asthma. They include: Wheezing Coughing Chest tightness Shortness of breath Asthma symptoms can come and go, and some workers might not have all of the symptoms. Workers can get work-related asthma even when using personal protective equipment such as respirators or face masks. Sometimes breathing problems start at work and continue after leaving work when exposure has stopped. How do I know if I have work-related asthma? Symptoms for work-related asthma tend to get better on weekends, vacations, or other times when away from work. However, in some cases, symptoms do not improve until extended time away from exposures or triggers. Your doctor can diagnose work-related asthma.

Your doctor will ask questions about your symptoms and will conduct a physical examination. The doctor might also order one or more tests, such as: Breathing tests (e.g., peak flow readings, spirometry, methacholine challenge) Allergy tests such as skin or blood tests If your doctor is concerned about a condition other than asthma, he/she might order other tests such as x-rays or other imaging tests. Causes Exposures from indoor water damage can trigger work-related asthma. Work-related asthma is associated with exposure to worksite triggers (irritants, allergens, and physical conditions). Examples of asthma triggers are: Animal dander, insects, and dust mites Chlorine-based cleaning products Cigarette smoke Materials from cockroaches Cold air Dust from wood, grain, flour, or green coffee beans Gases such as ozone Other possible triggers include: Irritant chemicals Metal dust Physical exertion Pollen and plants Strong fumes Vapors from chemicals (e.g., ammonia, isocyanates, and solvents) Wood smoke Symptom management Inhalers are often used to treat asthma attacks. The most important step of managing asthma is stopping or reducing exposure to triggers causing symptoms. Work with your doctor to develop a personal asthma control plan. Medical professionals often treat asthma with two general types of medicine: Quick -relief rescue inhalers (e.g., albuterol, levalbuterol) to open the airways. People use these medicines to treat asthma attacks or flare-ups. Quick relief medications are often used in combination with long-term control medicines such inhaled corticosteroids.

Some people who have AFib don’t know they have it and don’t have any symptoms. What it is Atrial fibrillation, often called AFib or AF, is the most common type of treated heart arrhythmia. An arrhythmia is when the heart beats too slowly, too fast, or in an irregular way. When a person has AFib, the normal beating in the upper chambers of the heart (the two atria) is irregular, and blood doesn't flow as well as it should from the atria to the lower chambers of the heart (the two ventricles). AFib may happen in brief episodes, or it may be a permanent condition. This illustration shows a normal heartbeat and an irregular heartbeat. Facts about AFib It is estimated that 12.1 million people in the US will have AFib in S 1 2 In 2021, AFib was mentioned on 232,030 death certificates and was the underlying cause of death in 28,037 of those deaths. 3 People of European descent are more likely to have AFib than Black people. Because the number of AFib cases increases with age and women generally live longer than men, more women than men experience AFib. Symptoms Some people who have AFib don't know they have it and don't have any symptoms. Others may experience one or more of the following symptoms: Irregular heartbeat. Heart palpitations (rapid, fluttering, or pounding). Lightheadedness. Extreme fatigue. Shortness of breath. Chest pain. Risk factors The risk for AFib increases with age. High blood pressure, the risk for which also increases with advancing age, accounts for about 1 in 5 cases of AFib. 4 Risk factors for AFib include: 4 5 Advancing age. High blood pressure. Obesity. European ancestry. Diabetes. Heart failure. Ischemic heart disease. Hyperthyroidism. Chronic kidney disease. Moderate to heavy alcohol use. Smoking.

When standard stroke risk factors were accounted for, AFib was associated with an approximately fivefold increased risk of ischemic stroke. 6 AFib causes about 1 in 7 strokes. 7 Strokes caused by complications from AFib tend to be more severe than strokes with other underlying causes. Strokes happen when blood flow to the brain is blocked by a blood clot or by fatty deposits called plaque in the blood vessel lining. Treatment and recovery Treatment for AFib can include: Medicines to control the heart's rhythm and rate. Blood-thinning medicine to prevent blood clots from forming and reduce stroke risk. Surgery. Medicine and healthy lifestyle changes to manage AFib risk factors. What are the consequences of AFib? More than 454,000 hospitalizations with AFib as the primary diagnosis happen each year in the US. 4 The condition contributes to about 158,000 deaths each year. 3 The death rate from AFib as the primary or a contributing cause of death has been rising for more than two decades. 7 View Larger The map shows that concentrations of counties with the highest Cardiac Dysrhythmia Hospitalization Rates are located primarily in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky North Carolina, West Virginia, Ohio, and Michigan.

B virus can spread from infected macaque monkeys to people. If you are exposed to a macaque monkey, begin first aid immediately and see a healthcare provider. What it is B virus infection is extremely rare. However, it can lead to severe brain damage or death if you do not get treatment immediately. People typically get infected with B virus if they are bitten or scratched by an infected macaque monkey; or have contact with the monkey's eyes, nose, or mouth. Signs and symptoms Symptoms typically start within one month of being exposed to B virus. However, they could appear in as little as 3 to 7 days. The first indications of B virus infection are typically flu-like symptoms, like fever and chills. Then, you may develop small blisters in the wound or area on your body that had contact with the monkey.

Treatment and recovery Get first aid immediately‎ If you are exposed to a macaque monkey, get first aid and seek immediate medical attention. Follow the steps below. Thoroughly wash the wound or area on your body that had contact with the monkey and gently scrub with soap, detergent, or iodine for 15 minutes. Run water over the wound or area for 15 to 20 minutes more. Tell the healthcare provider that you have been exposed to a macaque monkey that may be infected with B virus. If you got exposed to a macaque, wash right away and tell your doctor. Medications If your healthcare provider determines that you need treatment for B virus exposure or infection, you may be given antiviral medications. Timely first aid and treatment for high-risk exposures is crucial to preventing life-threatening disease. How animals are affected Macaque monkeys housed in primate facilities usually become infected with B virus by the time they reach adulthood. However, even when they are infected with B virus, monkeys typically do not have symptoms, or have just mild disease.

It spreads through tick bites, primarily by blacklegged (deer) ticks. Some people show no symptoms, others have flu-like symptoms. Babesiosis is preventable and treatable. Overview Babesiosis is a disease caused by microscopic parasites that infect red blood cells. A parasite is an organism (living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Although there are many different species (types) of Babesia parasite found in animals, only a few infect people. The most common species to infect people in the United States is Babesia microti . Signs and symptoms Many people with Babesiosis do not feel sick and have no symptoms. However, some people might get flu-like symptoms, such as: Fever Chills Sweats Headache Body aches Loss of appetite Nausea Fatigue Since the parasites attack red blood cells, babesiosis can lead to hemolytic anemia. Hemolytic anemia occurs when your red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be replaced. Babesiosis can become a serious, even life-threatening illness for certain people, especially those who: Do not have a spleen Have a weak immune system for other reasons such as cancer, lymphoma, or HIV Have serious health issues such as liver or kidney disease Are older (> 50 years old) Symptoms, if they appear, may start around a week after infection, but usually develop over a few weeks or months, or longer. How it spreads In the U.S. most Babesia infections are from blacklegged or deer tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) bites. Ticks are typically found in wooded, brushy, or grassy areas. Currently, most babesiosis cases occur in the Northeast and upper Midwest. Other less common ways of getting infected with Babesia include: Getting a blood transfusion that has the parasite in it. If a mother has babesiosis, she might pass it to her baby during pregnancy or when the baby is born.",condition

BV can occur without sexual activity, but factors like douching and multiple partners increase the risk. It can increase the risk of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and complications during pregnancy. What is bacterial vaginosis (BV)? Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a condition that happens when there is too much of certain bacteria in the vagina, causing an imbalance. Signs and symptoms How common is BV? BV is the most common vaginal condition in women ages 15-44. Douching, not using condoms, and having new or multiple sex partners can upset the normal balance of vaginal bacteria, increasing your risk for getting BV. How it spreads How does BV spread? Researchers do not know the cause of BV. However, we do know the condition most often occurs in those who are sexually active. BV is a result of an imbalance of ""good"" and ""harmful"" bacteria in a vagina. Douching, not using condoms , and having new or multiple sex partners can upset the normal balance of vaginal bacteria, increasing your risk for getting BV. We also do not know how sex causes BV. There also is no research to show that treating a sex partner affects whether someone gets BV. Having BV can increase your chances of getting other STDs. Douching, not using condoms, and having new or multiple sex partners can upset the normal balance of vaginal bacteria, increasing your risk for getting BV. BV rarely affects those who have never had sex. You cannot get BV from toilet seats, bedding, or swimming pools. Prevention How can I avoid getting BV? Healthcare providers and scientists do not completely understand how BV spreads or know how best to prevent it. The following basic prevention steps may help lower your risk of getting BV: Not having sex Limiting your number of sex partners Not douching Using condoms the right way every time you have sex I’m pregnant.",condition

If you are pregnant and have BV, your baby is more likely to be born early (premature) or at a low birth weight. Low birth weight means having a baby that weighs less than 5.5 pounds at birth. Treatment and recovery How do I know if I have BV? Many people with BV do not have symptoms. If you do have symptoms, you may notice: A thin white or gray vaginal discharge Pain, itching, or burning in the vagina A strong fish-like odor, especially after sex Burning when peeing Itching around the outside of the vagina How will my healthcare provider know if I have BV? A healthcare provider will examine your vagina for signs of discharge. They also can test a sample of vaginal fluid to determine if BV is present. Is there a cure for BV? A healthcare provider can treat BV with antibiotics. If you have symptoms, you should be checked and treated by a healthcare provider. It is important to take all the medicine your provider prescribes, even if your symptoms go away. Treatment also may reduce the risk for getting other STDs. BV can return even after treatment. Male sex partners of women with BV do not need treatment. However, BV can spread between female sex partners. What happens if I don't receive treatment? At times, BV will go away without treatment.

In their current form, bat influenza viruses do not appear to pose a threat to human health. The bat species currently known to carry bat influenza viruses are not native to the continental United States, but they are common in Central and South America. Causes and public health implications Experts from CDC and Universidad del Valle (University of the Valley) discovered influenza A in bats during a 2009-2010 study in Guatemala. They first found influenza A in bats in little yellow-shouldered bats. 1 Yellow-shouldered bat found in Guatemala. Photo credit: CDC/OID/NCEZID – Amy T. Gilbert. Bat influenza viruses have since been detected in some other species of bats in Central and South America. 2 The discovery of bat influenza viruses is important for public health because bats represent a new animal species that may act as a source of influenza viruses. Influenza viruses are already known to spread and cause disease in other animals. Laboratory research conducted at CDC and elsewhere suggests that bat influenza viruses would need to change significantly to be able to infect and spread easily among humans. Risk of bat flu spreading to humans CDC laboratory research suggests bat influenza viruses would need to undergo significant changes to become capable of infecting and spreading easily among people. Therefore, these viruses do not appear to pose a risk to human health in their current form. However, CDC scientists cannot rule out the possibility that these viruses could eventually become capable of infecting humans. The internal genes of bat influenza viruses are compatible with human influenza viruses.",condition
cdc_0103_2,Bat Flu,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/flu-in-animals/about/bat-flu.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"That means it is possible that these viruses could exchange genetic information with human influenza viruses through a process called ""reassortment."" Reassortment occurs when two or more influenza viruses infect a single host cell, which allows the viruses to swap genetic information. Reassortment facts‎ Reassortment can sometimes lead to the emergence of new flu viruses capable of infecting humans. The conditions needed for reassortment between human influenza viruses and bat influenza viruses remain unknown. A different animal (such as pigs, horses, dogs, or seals) would need to serve as a ""bridge."" That means that another animal would need to be capable of being infected with both bat influenza virus and human influenza viruses for reassortment to occur. Since the discovery of bat flu, there has been at least one study to assess the possibility of reassortment events occurring between bat influenza and other influenza viruses. 3 So far, the results of these studies continue to indicate that bat influenza viruses are very unlikely to reassort with other influenza viruses. Preliminary laboratory research at CDC suggests that human cells do not support growth of bat influenza viruses. 1 Difference between bat influenza viruses and other influenza viruses The bat influenza viruses discovered in Central and South America are very different from other influenza viruses in humans and animals. All influenza A viruses have hemagglutinin (HA) surface proteins. Until the discovery of bat influenza viruses, there were only 16 different classes (or “subtypes”) of HA proteins known to exist in nature. The new bat influenza viruses found in Central and South America are distinct from pre-existing subtypes. CDC scientists have classified them as new subtypes, denoted as “H17” and “H18.” 1 2 The other surface protein-coding gene of bat influenza viruses, neuraminidase (NA), is different from that of known influenza viruses, as well.",condition

Impact on influenza virus evolution The discovery of bat flu has shed light on the evolution of influenza A, B, and C viruses. It is possible that many of the internal genes of bat influenza viruses are descendants of influenza virus families that once circulated more widely in previous centuries and that are now extinct, or yet to be discovered. Using a process called phylogenic analysis, comparisons between different bat influenza viruses found in Central and South America have shown that there is considerable genetic diversity between them. Some researchers concluded that in Central and South American bat populations, the bat influenza viruses may have as much genetic diversity as those found in the influenza viruses of all other mammal and bird species combined. These conclusions suggest that bat influenza viruses have been evolving in bats over a very long time, potentially centuries. 2 How bat flu was discovered The discovery of the bat influenza viruses was made possible by field work conducted by the following: CDC's Global Disease Detection (GDD) Regional Center in Guatemala, in collaboration with CDC's Pathogen Discovery Program. CDC's Rabies program. Universidad del Valle in Guatemala. A total of 316 healthy bats from 21 different species were captured from eight locations in southern Guatemala during 2009 and 2010.

Initial viral screening determined that 3 of the 316 bats tested positive for influenza. All were from a single species known as little yellow-shouldered bats.

Bites can cause itching, loss of sleep, and, rarely, allergic reactions. Prevent bed bugs by regularly looking for signs of infestation. More Information For Everyone Health Care Providers Overview Bed bugs ( Cimex species ) are small, flat insects. Bed bugs bite people and animals at night while they sleep, feeding on their blood. Bed bugs are reddish-brown in color, are wingless, and range from 1mm to 7mm in size (roughly the size of Lincoln's head on a penny). They can live several months without a blood meal. Bed bugs are not known to spread diseases to people. However, they cause irritation, itching, and loss off sleep. Removal from dwellings can be expensive and inconvenient to remove. Where you can find bed bugs You can find bed bugs anywhere, from North and South America, to Africa, Asia, and Europe. Bed bugs are in five-star hotels and resorts. How clean a place is does not determine whether bed bugs are present. Signs and symptoms Although bed bugs are not known to spread diseases to people, they can cause itching and loss of sleep. Sometimes intense itching can lead to excessive scratching and possibly a secondary skin infection. An allergic reaction to several bites is possible. If you think you are having an allergic reaction to bed bug bites, speak with your healthcare provider. How to tell if you've been bitten Bed bug bites affect each person differently. Signs of a bed bug bites include No physical signs Small bite marks Serious allergic reactions (rare). When bed bugs bite, they inject fluids (anesthetic and anticoagulant) that prevents a person from feeling the bite when it happens. Most people do not notice the bite marks until they appear from one to several days after the initial bite. Bites look similar to mosquito or flea bites—a slightly swollen and red area that may itch and be irritating.",condition

Other symptoms of bed bug bites include insomnia, anxiety, and skin problems that arise from intense scratching of the bites. Allergic reactions are possible Allergic symptoms can include enlarged bite marks, painful swellings at the bite site, and, on rare occasions, anaphylaxis. If you think you are having an allergic reaction to bed bug bites, speak with your healthcare provider. Exposure risks Everyone is at risk for getting bed bugs when visiting an infested area. However, you are at higher risk of getting bed bugs if you travel frequently and share living and sleeping space where other people have previously slept. Causes and spread Bed bugs are experts at hiding. Their slim flat bodies allow them to fit into very small spaces. They can go long periods of time without a blood meal. Bed bugs spread by getting into the seams and folds of luggage, overnight bags, folded clothes, bedding, furniture, and anywhere else they can hide. Most people do not realize they are transporting bed bugs and infecting areas as they travel. Resource‎ DPDx - Bed Bug life cycle Reducing risk Early detection and eradication of bed bugs can make infestations easier to control. For those that travel, it may be helpful to look for signs of infestation, such as exoskeletons or bed bugs in folds of mattresses and sheets, in sleeping areas. Where to look for bed bugs Bed bug infestations usually happen around or near areas where people sleep. This includes apartments, shelters, houses, hotels, cruise ships, buses, trains, and dorm rooms. The bugs hide during the day in places on or around the bed. They can hide in The seams of mattresses Box springs Bed frames and headboards Dresser tables Inside cracks or crevices Behind wallpaper Bed bugs can travel over 100 feet in a night but tend to live within 8 feet of where people sleep.",condition

However, these bite marks may take as long as 14 days to develop in some people. It's important to look for other clues to determine if you have an infestation. Look for Exoskeletons (shed after molting), Bed bugs in the fold of mattresses and sheets, Rusty–colored blood spots on mattresses or nearby furniture, and A sweet musty odor. Treatment Treating bites Bed bug bites can cause inflammatory reactions in some people, but usually do not require medical treatment. The best way to treat a bite is to apply antiseptic creams or lotions to help with itching and to avoid scratching the area (to prevent secondary infections). For people with itchy inflammatory reactions, an antihistamine may help control the itching. Treating infestations If you think you have a bed bug infestation, contact a professional pest control company experienced with treating bed bugs.

Signs and symptoms of benzene poisoning depend on how you were exposed. Get clean and get medical care if you were exposed. Background Benzene is a liquid chemical at room temperature. It either has no color or is light-yellow. It has a sweet smell and is very flammable. Benzene evaporates into the air very quickly. It is heavier than air and may sink into lower areas. Benzene dissolves only a little in water and will float on top of water. Where it is found Benzene is formed in nature and from human activities. Natural sources include volcanoes and forest fires. It is also a natural part of crude oil, gasoline, and cigarette smoke. Benzene is used often in the United States. It is in the top 20 produced chemicals by quantity. Some industries use benzene to make other chemicals that are used to make plastics, resins, and nylon and synthetic fibers. It is also used to make: Detergents Drugs Dyes Some types of lubricants Pesticides Rubbers How it works Benzene works by causing cells not to work correctly. For example, it can cause bone marrow not to produce enough red blood cells. This can lead to anemia. It can also hurt the immune system by changing blood levels of antibodies and causing the loss of white blood cells. Signs and symptoms The level of benzene poisoning depends on the amount, how someone was exposed, and for how long. It also depends on the person's age and medical conditions they may have.

This secure, cloud-based system detects and monitors health threats. Successfully onboarding health care facilities, vendors, and public health sites into the platform is vital. High-quality live data feeds power the system. These data, paired with standardized tools and processes, enable effective investigation and rapid response. Our onboarding work is an investment in a modernized public health data infrastructure. Key roles in the process Facilities transmit de-identified patient information to the BioSense Platform in near real-time. Our partners in this process who help ensure high-quality data feeds include: The facility that will submit data. In addition to the organizations that deliver care, this could also include electronic health record vendors or health information exchanges. The site , our term for the public health authority that serves as an administrative hub for groupings of facilities that transmit data. The site administrator , the primary public health authority contact at each site. Site admins will build relationships with facility staff and oversee all aspects of onboarding. Site admins serve as liaisons between facilities and NSSP. Identifying your site administrator‎ If you are associated with a facility and you're not sure who your site administrator is, contact your state or local health department. You can also reach out to NSSP by emailing nssp@cdc.gov , or create an NSSP Service Desk ticket (account access required). Onboarding job aids These resources will help site administrators walk through onboarding step-by-step, from planning to the key phases of engaging, connecting, validating and operating.

The main cause of the pneumoconioses is workplace exposure. All forms of pneumoconioses can be severe. Overview Healthy lung versus black lung. The primary pneumoconioses are: Abestosis – caused by inhaling asbestos fibers Silicosis – caused by inhaling silica dust Coal workers' pneumoconiosis (commonly referred to as CWP or black lung) caused by inhaling coal mine dust There is also a form called mixed-dust pneumoconiosis. Byssinosis, caused by exposure to cotton dust, is sometimes included with pneumoconioses. Although the pattern of lung abnormality in Byssinosis is different from the types of disease listed above. Also, many consider the term pneumoconosis as referring only to diseases caused by inhaling mineral dusts. Pneumoconiosis typically takes years to develop. However, rapidly progressive forms of silicosis can occur after short periods of intense exposure. When severe, the diseases often lead to lung impairment, disability, and premature death. Pneumoconioses can be avoided through appropriate dust control. Other forms of pneumoconiosis can be caused by inhaling dusts containing: Aluminum Antimony Barium Graphite Iron Kaolin Mica Talc Symptoms Pneumoconiosis symptoms depend on how severe the disease is. They include: Shortness of breath Coughing Increased phlegm Diagnosis Identifying and classifying pneumoconioses Lung x-ray showing pneumoconiosis in coal miner. The pneumoconioses are typically detected through radiological imaging. Severity of lung impairment can be assessed using pulmonary function tests. The International Labor Office (ILO) provides guidelines for classifying radiographs of the pneumoconioses. NIOSH operates the B Reader Program . This program allows physicians to document their proficiency in classifying radiographs (using ILO guidelines) by taking an examination.",condition

Most patients do not experience side effects from transfusions. On rare occasions, transfusions can cause adverse reactions in patients receiving blood. Although the U.S. blood supply is safer than ever, some bacteria, viruses, etc. can infect blood transfusion recipients. All blood donors and blood donations are screened for infections and diseases. Overview The U.S. blood supply is safer than it has ever been. However, blood transfusions can transmit any bloodborne pathogen. Report a Possible Outbreak ‎ To report a possible transfusion-transmitted infection cluster or outbreak. Call: 770-488-7100 E-mail: haioutbreak@cdc.gov Complications Several types of bacteria, viruses, parasites and prions can infect blood donors and recipients, though these infections are rare. Adverse reactions (e.g., allergic reaction, transfusion-transmitted infection, etc.) to a blood transfusion are also very rare. The most common adverse reactions from blood transfusions are allergic and febrile reactions, which make up over half of all adverse reactions reported. Reducing Risk Screening donated blood Healthcare providers and blood banks ask donors a set of standard questions before donating blood including: Whether or not they are in good health Their social behavior and health history If they are free of any bacterial, viral or parasitic diseases If they have traveled to areas where transmittable diseases are common If their answers indicate they are not well or are at risk for having a disease transmissible by blood transfusion, they cannot donate blood.

The U.S. healthcare system needs nearly 5,000 units of platelets and 6.500 units of plasma per day. What CDC is doing The CDC's Office of Blood, Organ and Other Tissue Safety (BOOTS) conducts surveillance for adverse events following blood transfusions. Providers can use this information to prevent transfusion-related events through evidence-based interventions and recommendations. Hospitals provide this information voluntarily. Assisting state and local health departments and hospitals in investigating reports of potential infectious disease transmission. Collecting and monitoring data on blood safety and adverse reactions in the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hemovigilance Module since 2010.

Body lice spread by direct contact with others who have them. Symptoms include itching, rash, and bites. The only treatment is to improve hygiene and access to clean clothes. Overview Body lice are parasites, or insects, that feed on human blood. Body lice can spread disease. They live and lay eggs on clothing and bedding used by infested people. Adult body lice are small, only 2.3 – 3.6 mm in length (about the size of a sesame seed). Improved hygiene and access to regular changes of clean clothes is the only treatment needed for body lice infestations; however, in some cases pediculicides are recommended. Body lice can spread disease ( epidemic typhus , Bartonella quintana infection , and epidemic relapsing fever ). Symptoms Intense itching (pruritus) and rash caused by an allergic reaction to louse bites are common symptoms of body lice infestation. As with other lice infestations, intense itching leads to scratching which can cause sores and secondary bacterial infection of the skin. When body lice infestation lasts long, heavily bitten areas of the skin can become thickened and darkened, particularly in the mid-section of the body (waist, groin, upper thighs). Who is at risk Body lice exist worldwide but usually affect people who live in crowded conditions. They affect people without access to regular bathing and clean clothes. They can spread quickly in: People experiencing homelessness Refugees Survivors of war or natural disasters How it spreads Body lice spread through direct contact with a person who has body lice. They can also spread through contact with clothing, beds, or linens that have been in contact with a person infested with lice. However, in the United States, actual infestation with body lice tends to occur only in people who do not have access to housing, regular bathing, or clean clothes. Nits (lice eggs) take 6 – 9 days to hatch.",condition
cdc_0121_2,Body Lice,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/lice/about/body-lice.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Nits are tiny (0.8 – 0.3 mm) and hard to see; they can be confused for dandruff. Nymphs (newly hatched lice) are about the size of a pinhead and take about a week to grow into adults. Adult lice are about the size of a sesame seed, have six legs, and are tan to grayish white. Adult females can lay up to eight nits per day. Adult lice need to feed on blood several times each day; without blood meals, the louse will die within 1 – 2 days off the host. Dogs, cats, and other pets do not spread human lice. Prevention Take these steps to help prevent and control the spread of body lice: Bathe regularly and change into machine-washed clothes at least once a week. Machine wash and dry infested clothing and bedding using the hot water (at least 130°F) laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle. Dry clean clothing and items that are not washable OR seal them in a plastic bag and store for two weeks. Do not share clothing, beds, bedding, or towels used by a person infested with body lice. You can fumigate or dust with chemical insecticides to control and prevent the spread of body lice for certain diseases (e.g., epidemic typhus). Diagnosis You can diagnose body lice infestation by finding eggs and crawling lice in the seams of clothing. Sometimes you can see a body louse crawling or feeding on the skin. Although body lice and nits can be large enough to see with the naked eye, a magnifying lens may help to find crawling lice or eggs. See a healthcare provider if you are unsure about an infestation. Treatment and recovery You can treat a body lice infestation by improving personal hygiene. Bathe and change into clean clothes at least once a week. Wash clothing, bedding, and towels used by the person infested with lice using hot water (at least 130°F) and machine dry using the hot cycle. Pediculicide, a medicine that can kill lice, is sometimes used for treatment. If prescribed a pediculicide, apply it exactly as directed on the bottle or by your healthcare provider.",condition

It is caused by a toxin that attacks the body’s nerves and causes difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis, and even death. The toxin is made by Clostridium botulinum and related bacteria. There are five main kinds of botulism. All are medical emergencies. Overview Current Infant Botulism Outbreak Learn about a current outbreak of infant botulism linked to infant formula. Botulism (""BOT-choo-liz-um"") is a rare but serious illness caused by a toxin that attacks the body's nerves. Botulism causes difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis, and even death. The toxin is made by Clostridium botulinum and sometimes Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium baratii bacteria (germs). These bacteria can produce the toxin in food, wounds, and the intestines of infants. The bacteria that make botulinum toxin are found naturally in many places, but it's rare for them to make people sick. These bacteria make spores, which act like protective coatings. Spores help the bacteria survive in the environment, even in extreme conditions. The spores usually do not cause people to become sick, even when they're eaten. But under certain conditions, these spores can grow and make one of the most lethal toxins known. The conditions in which the spores can grow and make toxin are: Low-oxygen or no oxygen (anaerobic) environment Low acid Low sugar Low salt A certain temperature range A certain amount of water For example, improperly home-canned, preserved, or fermented foods can provide the right conditions for spores to grow and make botulinum toxin. When people eat these foods, they can become seriously ill, or even die, if they don't get proper medical treatment quickly. Most common types There are 5 main kinds of botulism. Foodborne botulism Foodborne botulism can happen by eating foods that have been contaminated with botulinum toxin.",condition
cdc_0126_2,Botulism,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Common sources of foodborne botulism are homemade foods that have been improperly canned, preserved, or fermented. Though uncommon, store-bought foods also can be contaminated with botulinum toxin. Wound botulism Wound botulism can happen if the spores get into a wound and make a toxin. People who inject illicit drugs have a greater chance of getting wound botulism. People who have had a traumatic injury, such as a motorcycle crash, or surgery also can get wound botulism. Infant botulism For reasons we do not understand, some infants get botulism when the spores get into their intestines, grow, and produce the toxin. Iatrogenic botulism Iatrogenic botulism can happen if too much botulinum toxin is injected for cosmetic reasons, such as for wrinkles. It also can happen if too much of the toxin is injected for medical reasons, such as for migraine headaches. Adult intestinal toxemia Adult intestinal toxemia is also known as adult intestinal colonization. This kind of botulism is a very rare. It can happen if the spores of the bacteria get into an adult's intestines, grow, and produce the toxin (similar to infant botulism). We don't know why people get this kind of botulism. People with a serious health condition affecting the gut might be more likely to get ill. All kinds of botulism can be fatal and are medical emergencies. If you or your child has signs and symptoms of botulism , immediately see your doctor or go to the emergency room. Do not wait.

BSE caused a major outbreak in the 1980-90s, with cases reported in at least 24 countries. Most cases occurred in the United Kingdom, but many other countries also reported cases. Changes to feed policies have made BSE extremely rare. Animal health officials continue to monitor suspicious deaths in cows to watch for a potential BSE recurrence. Causes and risk BSE is caused by a prion, an infectious protein. Prions are misfolded forms of proteins normally found in the bodies of animals and people. It typically takes years for symptoms to begin after an animal is infected with a prion. Scientists believe BSE may have been caused by feeding cattle meat-and-bone meal that contained prion-infected products from cows or sheep. There is strong evidence the BSE outbreak grew and spread throughout the U.K. when such infected feed was given to young calves. Outbreaks The United Kingdom The first two cases of BSE were identified in cows in 1986 in the United Kingdom. The cows were likely infected in the 1970s. The U.K. quickly became the epicenter of the outbreak. Overall, more than 184,000 cows in the U.K. died from BSE between 1986 and 2015. The outbreak was widespread, with more than 35,000 U.K. herds affected. Cases peaked in 1993 at nearly 1,000 new cases per week. Cases deceased drastically after control measures were implemented. BSE cases are still reported occasionally but are very rare. North America The first North American BSE case was reported in 1993 in a cow imported into Canada from the UK. Rendered cohorts of this cow may have been responsible for 19 additional Canadian BSE cases beginning in 2003. In addition, animal health officials have identified 6 BSE cases in cows in the United States. One was imported from Canada and is believed to have been infected there.",condition
cdc_0128_2,Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/mad-cow/php/animal-health/index.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"The others were diagnosed with atypical BSE, which many researchers believe to be a sporadic illness not caused by contaminated feed. Other countries Outside the U.K., BSE was first reported in Ireland in 1989 and Portugal and Switzerland in 1990. By 2005, the number of countries reporting BSE among native cattle increased to 24, with the majority in Europe. Control measures Animal health officials eventually determined BSE-infected cows had eaten feed made from other cows that died from prion disease. This led to feed bans in multiple countries, which drastically reduced the number of BSE cases reported. Early efforts to control the BSE outbreak focused on culling (killing) sick animals to prevent them from entering the food chain. The UK implemented the most stringent control measure - excluding animals >30 months old from the human and animal food supplies. It also included a ban on using meat from around the animals' spinal columns since prions affect the nervous system. The programs - along with bans in other countries - have prevented additional BSE outbreaks. Occasional cases still occur, but they are very rare. Risk to people Strong evidence exists that consuming meat from BSE-infected cows causes variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in people. vCJD cases began in the U.K. about 10 years after BSE-contaminated beef likely made its way for an extended period into food produced for people. This is consistent with the time between when someone is exposed to a prion disease and when they develop one themselves. As BSE has been largely eradicated, it is not thought to pose much risk to people currently.

Signs and symptoms of bromine poisoning depend on how you were exposed. Get clean and get medical care if you were exposed. Background Bromine is a naturally occurring element that is a liquid at room temperature. It has a brownish-red color and smells like bleach. It dissolves in water. Where it is found Bromine is found naturally in the earth's crust and in seawater. Bromine can also be found as another option to chlorine in swimming pools. Products with bromine are used in agriculture, sanitation and as fire retardants (chemicals that help prevent things from catching fire). Some bromine-containing products were historically used as sedatives (drugs that can make people calm or sleepy). However, these drugs are for the most part no longer found on the market in the United States. How it works Bromine can irritate the skin and tissues, including the tissues that make mucus in your mouth and nose. Signs and symptoms The level of bromine poisoning depends on the amount, how someone was exposed, and for how long. It also depends on the person's age and medical conditions they may have. Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to bromine. If breathed in: Cough Trouble breathing Headache Irritation of your mucous membranes (inside your mouth, nose, etc.) Dizziness Watery eyes If exposed to skin: Skin irritation and burns Cooling sensation closely followed by a burning feeling If swallowed in large amounts: Nausea Vomiting Swallowing compounds (combinations of bromine with other chemicals) with bromine causes different effects depending on the compound.

Your doctor will decide which antibiotics you'll get for a minimum of 6-8 weeks. To be sure you get the right medicines for you, let your healthcare providers know if you are: Pregnant Allergic to doxycycline or rifampin Are immunosuppressed from medical conditions or other medicines Brucella RB51 treatment If you have with an infection from a strain of Brucella called RB51 from consuming infected animal products, you'll need antibiotics other than rifampin. This particular strain of Brucella is resistant to it, meaning rifampin will not treat the infection. It's important that you take all your medicines when being treated for brucellosis. If you're not properly treated, the infection can become chronic and lead to long-term disease associated with arthritis, endocarditis, chronic fatigue, depression, and swelling of the liver or spleen. Depending on the timing of treatment and how sick you are, recovery may take a few weeks to several months. Death from brucellosis is rare and only happens in less than 2% of cases.

cdc_0134_1,Bullying,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/youth-violence/about/about-bullying.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Bullying Oct. 28, 2024 Key points Bullying is a type of violence experienced by youth and it can happen in person and through technology. Bullying is widespread in the United States and causes harm to youth. Preventing bullying involves teaching kids safe ways to stand up against it and enhancing their interpersonal skills, like empathy and conflict management. What is bullying? CDC defines bullying as any unwanted aggressive behavior(s) by another youth or group of youths, who are not siblings or current dating partners. It involves an observed or perceived power imbalance, and is repeated multiple times or is highly likely to be repeated. Bullying may inflict harm or distress on the victim including physical, psychological, social, or educational harm. 1 Common types of bullying include: Physical such as hitting, kicking, and tripping. Verbal including name-calling and teasing. Relational or social such as spreading rumors and leaving out of the group. Damage to victim's property. Bullying can also occur through technology, called electronic bullying or cyberbullying. 1 A young person can be a perpetrator, a victim, or both (also known as a ""bully/victim""). Quick facts and stats Bullying is an adverse childhood experience that is widespread in the United States. Bullying harms all youth involved including those who are bullied, those who bully others, and bystanders who witness it. Bullying is common. About one in five high school students reported being bullied on school property in the past year. More than one in six high school students reported being bullied electronically in the past year including through texting and social media. 2 Some youth experience bullying more than others. Female students were more likely than male students to experience bullying, both on school property and electronically.",condition
cdc_0134_2,Bullying,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/youth-violence/about/about-bullying.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Additionally, Asian students and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander students were less likely than Hispanic, White, and Multiracial students to be bullied at school. Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander students were less likely than students from most other racial and ethnic groups to be electronically bullied. 2 Bullying is a frequent discipline problem. A national survey found that 28% of middle schools, 15% of high schools, and 10% of elementary schools reported the occurrence of bullying at school at least once a week. About 37% of middle schools reported the occurrence of cyberbullying at least once a week, followed by 25% of high schools and 6% of elementary schools. 3 Warning signs Not all children who are bullied show warning signs, but StopBullying.gov suggests being aware of these common signs: Unexplained injuries. Lost or destroyed clothing, books, electronics, or jewelry. Frequent headaches or stomachaches, feeling sick, or faking illness. Difficulty sleeping or frequent nightmares. Declining grades, loss of interest in schoolwork, or not wanting to go to school. Outcomes Bullying can result in physical injury, social and emotional distress, self-harm, and even death. It also increases the risk for depression, anxiety, sleep difficulties, lower academic achievement, and dropping out of school. Youth who bully others are at increased risk for substance misuse, academic problems, and experiencing violence later in adolescence and adulthood. 4 Youth who bully others and are bullied themselves suffer the most serious consequences and are at greater risk for mental health and behavioral problems. Prevention We all have a role to play in preventing bullying. Youth and adults play important roles in preventing violence and creating safe communities where young people can thrive. A bystander (someone who witnesses bullying, either in person or online) can make a positive impact by becoming an upstander.",condition

CASPER is quick, relatively inexpensive, flexible, and uses a simple reporting format. It uses a valid sampling methodology to collect information at the household level. About CASPER is a type of rapid needs assessment (RNA) that provides household-level information to public health leaders and emergency managers. CASPER can provide accurate and timely data for decision makers through precise analysis and interpretation. CASPER is a cross-sectional epidemiologic design; it is not surveillance. Information from CASPERs can help public health and emergency managers: Initiate public health action Identify information gaps Facilitate disaster planning, response, and recovery activities Allocate resources Collect and assess new or changing needs in the community Interactive Map of CASPERs See the interactive map for examples of how CASPER has been used throughout the United States since 2001. The CASPER methodology is an adaptation of epidemiologic techniques used by scientists in the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) who estimate vaccine coverage in Africa. CASPER's cluster sampling design involves two stages. The first stage includes 30 clusters selected probability proportional to size. The second stage includes seven households interviewed within each cluster. This design provides estimates for the population. There may be situations in which this design is not feasible or ideal. Modifications are acceptable. For additional information, read the CASPER Overview fact sheet . There are many opportunities for CASPERs to influence public health. A CASPER can be used in both a disaster and non-disaster setting.",condition
cdc_0135_2,CASPER,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/casper/php/overview/index.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"For example, CASPER methodology has been used to do the following: Analyze public health perceptions Estimate needs of a community Assist in planning for emergency response Benefits of CASPER Information is key for decision-making. Information sent to the right people, at the right place, at the right time, is optimal for any successful response. CASPER addresses this by providing valid information rapidly about the general and health needs of a community to decision-makers. CASPER is generalizable (providing population estimates), timely, relatively low cost, reported in a simple format, and flexible. CASPER was originally designed to provide information during a disaster response. It can also be used when population-representative data are needed during other disaster phases (preparedness, recovery, mitigation). Additionally, it can be used in situations unrelated to a disaster. For example, public health departments have used CASPER to: Identify household-level information about community health status Learn more about emerging infectious diseases, such as Zika virus and H1N1 Assess community awareness/opinions/concerns on subjects such as the following: Climate change Opioid use Healthy homes Radiation emergency preparedness Goals The primary goals of the CASPER are to rapidly obtain information about the needs of an affected community and to assess changes in needs during the response or recovery period. CASPER also produces household-based population estimates of needs for decision makers. Examples of CASPER objectives include the following: Determine the critical health needs Assess the impact of a disaster on the community Characterize the population residing in the area including any ongoing health effects Evaluate the effectiveness of recovery efforts using a follow-up CASPER CASPER is not intended to deliver food, medicine, medical services or other resources to the affected area or to provide direct services to residents such as cleanup or home repair.",condition

CDC’s National Center for Environmental Health developed the CASPER Toolkit to outline and standardize the assessment methodology. CDC coined the term CASPER to distinguish it from other rapid needs assessments. The CASPER toolkit provides guidelines to assist personnel from any federal, state, tribal, local, or territorial (STLT) public health department or other emergency response agencies in conducting CASPER. The toolkit is focused on United States disaster response. However, it may also be adapted for use in a non-disaster or international setting. The toolkit provides a standardized, step-by-step guide for conducting a CASPER, including: Preparing a checklist Questionnaire development Sample selection Training Data collection Analysis Report writing Templates and examples Public health personnel, emergency management officials, academics, or others who wish to assess household-level public health needs will find the toolkit useful for rapid data collection for actionable decision-making during disaster or non-emergency situations.",condition

Remember, a CASPER will be descriptive of the entire sampling frame (geographic area from which your sample is drawn). It will not provide detailed information on subpopulations or specific groups. For example, if you want to determine the needs or status of pregnant women or persons experiencing homelessness, you should not conduct a CASPER. CASPER phases There are four phases in a CASPER: prepare for the CASPER; conduct the CASPER in the field; analyze the data; and write the report. Phase 1: Prepare for CASPER Checklist to prepare for CASPER. As you prepare to conduct a CASPER, there are many planning questions that should be addressed. Work with leadership, key partners, and CASPER subject matter experts (SMEs) within your state or CDC to help plan and prepare. Keep in mind that preparing for a CASPER can take several hours (e.g., during a response) or, if time allows, several months (e.g., in a non-disaster setting). Keep Reading: Prepare for CASPER Phase 2: Conduct the CASPER in the field Group of volunteers CASPER is conducted through face-to-face interviews in the field. There are several advantages to conducting face-to-face interviews. These include a high response rate and the ability to distribute health information or other materials to the community. Face-to-face interviews have the additional benefit of directly connecting the community to local staff, increasing the visibility of and trust in the health department.",condition

Healthcare providers should check for signs and symptoms of TBI if an older adult has: Fallen or has a fall-related injury, such as a hip fracture. Been in a car crash. This is especially important among older adults who are taking blood thinners, 11 such as: Anticoagulants like warfarin (Coumadin), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and apixaban (Eliquis). Antiplatelet medications like clopidogrel (Plavix), ticagrelor (Brilinta), and acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin). These medicines may increase the risk for bleeding in the brain following a TBI. 11 Bleeding in the brain after a TBI may put a person at risk for more severe injury or death. Potential effects of TBIs A TBI may lead to short- or long-term health problems Depending on the severity of the injury, those who get a TBI may face health problems that last a few days or the rest of their lives. For example, a person with a mild TBI or concussion may experience short-term symptoms and feel better within a couple of weeks or months. And a person with a moderate or severe TBI may have long-term or life-long effects from the injury. A person with a possible TBI should be seen by a healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider may have treatment to help speed your recovery. Most people with a mild TBI or concussion can recover safely at home following a medical check-up.

Not all unusual patterns of cancer are cancer clusters. Contact your state, tribal, local, or territorial health department or cancer registry if you think your community is experiencing more cancer than usual. Overview Cancer is a group of diseases in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. As a group, cancers are very common. Given the frequency with which cancers are diagnosed, sometimes situations arise where an unusual number of cancers are diagnosed among people in a particular location. These unusual numbers may be from chance, or they may result from the following: Different cancer screening practices Different access to health care, which may reflect other social and economic factors Genetic susceptibility to a particular cancer Behavioral risks and social determinants of health Occupational exposures Environmental exposures Many causes of cancer are unknown. However, some environmental exposures have been shown to be related to the development of cancer in specific organs. For example, if you are exposed to asbestos , you could develop mesothelioma . Definitions Some unusual patterns of cancer are considered a cancer cluster . A cancer cluster is defined as a greater than expected number of the same or etiologically related cancer cases that occurs within a group of people in a geographic area over a defined period of time. Etiology refers to causes and risk factors associated with the development of disease. For example, exposure to the sun can cause skin cancer. The definition of a cancer cluster can be further explained as follows: A greater than expected number When the number of observed cases is greater than typically observed in a similar setting.",condition
cdc_0153_2,Cancer Clusters,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/cancer-environment/about/,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Of the same or e tiologically related cancer cases Cases are of the same type, are within a family of tumors (for example Ewing's family of tumors ) or have a known or suggested link to the same specific environmental or chemical exposures. It is possible to consider multiple cancer types when such a known exposure (for example, radiation or a specific chemical) is linked to more than one cancer type or when more than one contaminant or exposure type has been identified. Within a group of people The population in which the cancer cases are occurring is defined by its demographic factors (for example, race/ethnicity, age, and sex). In a geographic area The geographic area may be based upon pre-existing geopolitical boundaries (for example, census tract, county, or ZIP code/ZIP code tabulation area). It may be defined according to the nature and extent of potential exposures that may cross multiple or partial boundaries. For example, air pollution from a hazardous waste incinerator which may cross multiple counties or census tracts. These geographic boundaries are used to determine the number of cancer cases as they relate to the total population in this predefined area. It is possible to create or obscure a cluster inadvertently by modifying the area of interest. Over a defined period of time The time frame used to establish the beginning and end dates for analysis. The time period chosen for analysis will affect both the total cases observed and the calculation of the expected incidence of cancer in the population.

For information about cancer in the workplace, please see the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health website. Examining unusual patterns of cancer State, tribal, local, and territorial health departments, along with cancer registries, respond to questions about unusual patterns of cancer. Usually, health departments start by gathering information about the unusual pattern of cancer, including the expected cancer rate, types of cancer, number of cases, and the age, sex, race, address, occupation, and age at diagnosis of the people with cancer. CDC/ATSDR has created a decision-making tool that can be used by health departments for determining the need to further assess an unusual pattern of cancer. The tool contains a set of criteria that can be used to assess the cancer(s) of concern and/or related environmental risk factors. These criteria promote further assessment of unusual patterns of cancer. Reducing your risk of developing cancer In general, cancers have a variety of risk factors related to behavioral, lifestyle, occupational, and environmental risks. For many cancers, you can reduce your risk of developing cancer by adopting a healthy lifestyle that includes avoiding tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, and sun exposure; increasing physical activity; maintaining a recommended body weight; and eating a healthy and nutritious diet.

It is caused by specific type A influenza viruses known to infect, cause illness, and spread in dogs. In general, canine influenza viruses are thought to pose a low threat to people. Signs and symptoms Canine influenza, also known as dog flu, is currently caused by an influenza A(H3N2) virus that spreads in dogs. Dog flu likely poses a low threat to people. Canine influenza A(H3N2) viruses are different from seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses that commonly spread among people. To date, there is no evidence of spread of canine influenza viruses from dogs to people. There has not been a single reported case of human infection with a canine influenza virus anywhere in the world. In 2016, CDC used the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool to evaluate the potential risk of canine influenza A(H3N2) viruses causing a pandemic and found it to be low. Evolving viruses Influenza viruses are constantly changing. It is possible that a canine influenza A virus could change to gain the ability to infect and spread easily between people. Humans have little immunity against new, non-human (novel) influenza A viruses. Infections in people with novel influenza A viruses are concerning when they occur. If these viruses acquire the ability to spread easily among people, it could result in a pandemic. For this reason, the World Health Organization conducts global flu surveillance, which has led to detection of novel influenza A virus infections in humans. Surveillance focuses on novel influenza A viruses of animal origin (such as avian or swine influenza A viruses). Signs of Illness in Dogs The signs of this illness in dogs include: cough, runny nose, fever, lethary, eye discharge, and reduced appetite. However, not all dogs will show signs of illness.",condition
cdc_0157_2,Canine Flu,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/flu-in-animals/about/canine-flu.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"The severity of illness associated with canine flu in dogs can range from no signs to severe illness resulting in pneumonia and sometimes death. Most dogs recover from dog flu within 2 to 3 weeks. However, some dogs may develop secondary bacterial infections, which can lead to more severe illness and pneumonia. Anyone who has concerns about their pet's health, or whose pet is showing signs of dog flu, should contact their veterinarian. Testing is available to confirm canine influenza A(H3N2) virus infection in dogs. Your veterinarian can tell you if testing is appropriate. Understanding risk H3N2 canine influenza viruses are not endemic in dogs in the United States but multiple, localized outbreaks with regional die-outs continue to occur, seeded by repeated re-introductions from Asia. H3N8 canine influenza viruses have not been reported since 2016 and do not appear to be actively circulating anymore. If evidence emerges that canine influenza viruses can infect people with the potential for sustained human-to-human spread, CDC has a plan in place. CDC will execute its existing authorities to limit the introduction and/or spread of that pandemic virus into or within the United States. CDC regulations require that dogs be healthy to enter the United States. Dogs may be denied entry or further evaluated if they look like they could be sick with a communicable disease. For dogs that appear sick or are dead upon arrival in the United States, CDC can require a veterinary examination or a necropsy (animal autopsy) at the owner's expense. Multiple agencies may have regulatory authority over pets such as dogs and cats when entering the United States. The United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Veterinary Services has animal health requirements related to bringing a pet dog to the United States from a foreign country.

Dog flu is thought to spread mainly through respiratory droplets produced when infected dogs cough or sneeze. It can also spread through contact with contaminated surfaces. What CDC is doing about dog flu‎ Current CDC influenza virus regulations apply only to viruses with pandemic potential in people. However, CDC is doing a number of things to be prepared in the unlikely event that dog flu becomes a threat to humans or to animals other than dogs. CDC continues to conduct year-round surveillance for seasonal and novel influenza A viruses. All human infections with novel influenza A viruses are fully investigated. Human infections with a novel influenza A virus of animal origin are reportable to CDC. CDC has existing collaborative protocols with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services to work together in the event of outbreaks of novel influenza A viruses. These same protocols would be followed in the event of an outbreak of dog flu among people. Third, CDC conducted a risk assessment on the pandemic potential of H3N2 canine influenza viruses using the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool. The assessment found the pandemic risk posed by canine influenza viruses to be low. Prevention Vaccines to protect dogs against H3N2 dog flu are available in the United States. Your veterinarian can provide additional information about these vaccines and whether you should consider vaccinating your dog. Dog owners whose dogs are coughing or showing other signs of respiratory disease should not expose their dog to other dogs or to cats. After exposure to dogs showing signs of respiratory disease, people should clean and disinfect clothing, equipment, surfaces, and hands.

In 2004, cases of an unknown respiratory illness in dogs were reported in the United States. An investigation showed that this respiratory illness was caused by equine influenza viruses. Scientists believe that after jumping from horses to dogs, the virus adapted to cause illness in dogs and spread among them. It spreads especially quickly among dogs housed in kennels and shelters. This is now considered a dog-specific (canine) H3N8 virus. In September 2005, this virus was identified by experts as a ""newly emerging pathogen in the dog population"" in the United States. H3N8 canine influenza viruses have not been reported since 2016 and do not appear to be actively circulating anymore. Origins of H3N2 Canine Influenza Canine influenza H3N2 viruses originated in birds and spread to dogs . The first H3N2 canine influenza viruses were reported in 2004. There has also been reported spread of H3N2 canine influenza viruses from dogs to cats. H3N2 canine influenza viruses were first detected in dogs in South Korea in 2007. These viruses have also been reported in dogs in China, Thailand, and Canada. H3N2 canine influenza viruses were first detected in the United States in April 2015 . They have now been found in multiple U.S. states and regions. To date, the H3N2 canine viruses reported in the United States have been almost identical genetically to those previously reported in Asia. Treatment Treatment for dog flu largely consists of supportive care. In milder cases, supportive care may include medication to make your dog more comfortable and fluids to ensure that your dog remains well hydrated. This helps to keep the dog comfortable and hydrated while its body mounts an immune response.

Cannabis can be used in a number of ways. How cannabis affects a person depends on several factors. What we know about cannabis Cannabis, which can also be called marijuana, weed, pot, or bud, refers to the dried flowers, leaves, stems, and seeds of the cannabis plant. The cannabis plant contains more than 100 compounds (or cannabinoids). These compounds include tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is impairing or mind-altering, as well as other active compounds, such as cannabidiol (CBD). CBD – by itself - is not impairing, meaning it does not cause a ""high"". 1 Types Cannabis can be used in a number of ways. The most common ways include: 2 3 Smoked in joints (like a cigarette), in blunts (cigars or cigar wrappers that have been partly or completely refilled with cannabis) or in bongs (pipes or water pipes) Vaped using electronic vaporizing devices (like vape pens) or other vaporizers Mixed or infused into foods or drinks (called edibles) like cookies, cakes, or brownies, or tea, cola, or alcohol Additionally, some people inhale the oil concentrates and other extracts from the cannabis plant—this is known as dabbing.

Find quick facts about CO poisoning and what can be done to prevent it. What it is Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless gas that kills without warning. It claims the lives of hundreds of people every year and makes thousands more ill. Many household items including gas- and oil-burning furnaces, portable generators, and charcoal grills produce this poison gas. Symptoms The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness, upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. CO symptoms are often described as “flu-like.” If you breathe in a lot of CO, it can make you pass out or kill you. People who are sleeping, drunk, or under the influence of other substances can die from CO poisoning before they have symptoms. Risk factors Everyone is at risk for CO poisoning. Infants, the elderly, and people with chronic heart disease, anemia, or breathing problems are more likely to get sick from CO. Each year, more than 400 Americans die from unintentional CO poisoning not linked to fires, more than 100,000 visit an emergency department, and more than 14,000 are hospitalized. Reducing risk CO is found in fumes produced any time you burn fuel in cars or trucks, small engines, stoves, lanterns, grills, fireplaces, gas ranges, or furnaces. CO can build up indoors and poison people and animals who breathe it. However, you can reduce your risk of CO poisoning with a few small steps. CO detectors Replace your CO detector following manufacturer instructions Install battery-operated or battery back-up CO detectors near every sleeping area in your home. Check CO detector batteries when you change the time on your clocks each spring and fall to be sure they are functioning properly. Consider buying a detector with a digital readout.",condition

Replace your CO detector following the manufacturer's instructions or every 5 years. Set a reminder on your smartphone or other device calendar when you purchase and install the detector. Oil and gas furnaces and other household appliances Have your heating system serviced annually Have your heating system, water heater, and any other gas, oil, or coal burning appliances serviced by a qualified technician every year. Make sure your gas appliances are vented properly. Horizontal vent pipes for appliances, such as a water heater, should go up slightly as they go toward outdoors, as shown below. This prevents CO from leaking if the joints or pipes aren't fitted tightly. When you buy gas equipment, buy only equipment carrying the seal of a national testing agency, such as Underwriters' Laboratories. If you smell an odor from your gas refrigerator, have an expert service it. An odor from your gas refrigerator can mean it could be leaking CO. Never heat your house with a gas oven. Don't cook or burn anything on a stove or fireplace that isn't vented. Horizontal vent pipes for appliances, such as a water heater, should go up slightly as they go toward outdoors Chimneys, charcoal, and portable appliances Have your chimney checked or cleaned every year. Chimneys can be blocked by debris, which can cause CO to build up inside your home or cabin. Never burn charcoal indoors. Burning charcoal - red, gray, black, or white - gives off CO. Never use a portable gas camp stove indoors. Do not use portable flameless chemical heaters indoors. Portable generators Download Operate your generator outdoors more than 20 feet from windows, doors, and vents to avoid CO poisoning Never use a generator inside your home or garage, even if doors and windows are open.

Cardiomyopathy can be acquired—developed because of another disease, condition, or factor—or inherited. What it is Cardiomyopathy represents a collection of diverse conditions of the heart muscle. These diseases have many causes, symptoms, and treatments and can affect people of all ages and races. When cardiomyopathy occurs, the normal muscle in the heart can thicken, stiffen, thin out, or fill with substances the body produces that do not belong in the heart muscle. As a result, the heart muscle's ability to pump blood is reduced. This, in turn, can lead to irregular heartbeats, the backup of blood into the lungs or rest of the body, and heart failure. Cardiomyopathy can be acquired—developed because of another disease, condition, or factor—or inherited. The cause isn't always known. The main types of cardiomyopathy include the following: 1 2 3 4 Dilated: meaning that one of the pumping chambers (ventricles) of the heart is enlarged. This is more common in males and is the most common form of cardiomyopathy in children. It can occur at any age and may or may not be inherited. Hypertrophic: where the heart muscle is thickened. This often presents in childhood or early adulthood and can cause sudden death in adolescents and young adult athletes. 1 It is often an inherited condition, and a person may not have any symptoms. If there is a family history of this, other family members can be tested and adjust their activities to reduce the risk of sudden death.

A genetic counselor or healthcare provider can help determine which family members should be tested first. Overview Many people do not know they have a genetic condition until symptoms of that condition begin to affect their lives. By then, treatments might be less likely to work. Cascade testing offers one way of finding people with genetic conditions before they show symptoms, allowing them to take steps to prevent disease or treat it early. How it works If you have been diagnosed with a genetic condition, your family members are more likely to have it, too. Sharing your diagnosis with your family members allows them to learn more and be checked for the condition. Finding and treating a genetic condition early can lead to better health. Family members who are most likely to have the same genetic change, or mutation, are tested first. From there, genetic testing ""cascades"" through the family depending on who has the genetic change and who does not. For example, if genetic testing shows that your mother has the same genetic change that you have, family members on your mother's side would be tested. Your father's side would not need to be tested. How to share your diagnosis with your family members The first step in cascade testing is to let your family members know about your diagnosis and genetic test results. Here are some tips to get started: Gather information to share with your family members. This may include the following: Your diagnosis Your genetic test report(s): Providing a copy of your genetic test report for your family members to take to a genetic counselor may help your family members receive testing quicker.",condition

Determine which family members should be tested first. A genetic counselor or medical provider can help you with this. Your children, sisters, brothers, and parents are most likely to have the same genetic condition. Testing should start with them, with the limitation that genetic testing for adult-onset conditions is not generally done in children. If a family member is not available for testing (for example, the family member does not want to be tested or has died), then moving to more distant family members is appropriate. Decide how you would like to share the information with your family members. Below are some options: Talk to your family members directly. Your genetic counselor can help you plan how to tell your family members, including what information is most important. Write a letter explaining your diagnosis, including any related genetic testing and lab results.

Why it matters CAUTIs are one of the most common HAIs. About 75% of UTIs developed in hospitals are associated with a urinary catheter. 15-25% of hospitalized patients receive urinary catheters during their hospital stay. CAUTIs are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, healthcare costs and length of stay. They are preventable. Background A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection that involves any of the organs or structures of the urinary tract, (e.g., kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra). A CAUTI occurs when germs (usually bacteria) enter the urinary tract through the urinary catheter and cause infection. Recommendations All healthcare facilities Only use urinary catheters when needed. Place catheters using proper germ-free techniques with sterile equipment. Maintain the catheter's closed sterile drainage system. Remove catheters as soon as patients no longer need them. Prolonged use is the most important risk factor for CAUTIs. Healthcare facilities should follow the 2009 CDC Guideline for Prevention of Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infections . The guideline emphasizes the proper use, insertion, and maintenance of urinary catheters in different healthcare settings. It also presents effective quality improvement programs that healthcare facilities can use to prevent CAUTIs.

CLABSIs are preventable. Overview Importance Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) result in thousands of deaths each year and billions of dollars in added costs to the U.S. healthcare system – but they are preventable. Central lines A central line (also known as a central venous catheter) is a catheter (tube) that healthcare providers often place in a large vein in the neck, chest or groin. Central lines are different from peripheral IVs (shorter IVs placed in the hand, arm or foot for vein access); central lines access a major vein close to the heart, can remain in place for weeks or months, and are much more likely to be a source of serious infection. Central lines are commonly used in intensive care units. Purpose of central lines Give medicines for treatment of pain, infection or other medical issues (e.g., cancer or heart problems). Provide fluids or nutrition. Help conduct certain medical tests. Types Types of central lines Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) . Placed into a vein in the arm. Tunneled catheter. Passed under the skin and placed into a vein in the chest or neck. Providers can insert medicine right into the catheter. Implanted port. Surgically placed under the skin. Providers insert medicines using a needle placed through the skin into the catheter. An implanted port is not as visible as a tunneled catheter, does not require as much daily care, and does not get in the way of a patient's regular activities as much as a PICC line or a tunneled catheter might.

Chapare is deadly; about 60% of people with the disease die. There is no specific treatment for Chapare. A limited number of Chapare outbreaks have been reported, all in Bolivia. What it is Chapare hemorrhagic fever (Chapare) is an illness caused by infection with the Chapare virus. This virus can spread to people through contact with the saliva, urine, and droppings of infected rodents. Chapare virus has caused a small number of documented outbreaks, all in Bolivia. All outbreaks have been limited in scale, with no evidence of sustained community transmission. The first outbreak consisted of one fatal case reported in 2003 in Chapare Province. In 2019, the virus reemerged in Caranavi, where nine cases were reported with four deaths. Health authorities confirmed some of these cases were from person-to-person transmission among healthcare workers. In 2025, two separate cases were detected in La Paz Department. Because Chapare can cause severe disease and because it can potentially spread in healthcare facilities, Chapare remains a public health concern. Healthcare providers: Review guidance on emergency services, screening, testing, infection control and PPE for viral hemorrhagic fevers like Chapare. Signs and symptoms Chapare symptoms are like those of other South American hemorrhagic fevers, such as Argentine hemorrhagic fever or Bolivian hemorrhagic fever. Due to the low number of reported Chapare cases, there is limited information about the disease. Documented signs and symptoms of Chapare include: Fever Headache Joint and muscle pain Pain behind the eyes Stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea Bleeding gums Rash Irritability Evidence suggests that pregnant women who are infected with Chapare virus may have complications, including miscarriage or death of the mother or newborn.",condition

However, other similar viruses are known to infect the fetus when it is in the uterus. Prevention Chapare virus has not been detected outside of Bolivia. If you are in an area of Bolivia where the virus has been detected: Avoid areas that are infested with rodents and other small mammals. Avoid areas where you see signs of rodent infestation like droppings. Avoid contact with the body fluids of people who are sick with Chapare. Healthcare providers should use standard contact and droplet precautions with eye protection while managing suspected or confirmed Chapare cases. They should use airborne precautions when performing procedures that could cause the virus to spray into the air. Keep Reading Prevent rodent infestations Testing and Diagnosis Healthcare providers can diagnose Chapare with blood tests that detect the virus, like polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There are currently no antibody tests that can tell if someone had the virus in the past. Clinicians should notify their state or local health department if a patient has recently been in an area with Chapare virus and has compatible symptoms. Treatment and recovery There is currently no specific treatment for Chapare. Supportive therapy can help people recover from and survive. This includes: Providing fluids and electrolytes (body salts) Using medication to support blood pressure, reduce vomiting and diarrhea, and manage fever and pain Treating other infections, if they occur Even months after symptoms stop, people who recover from Chapare may continue to shed the virus in their blood, saliva, urine, or semen.",condition

Overview Roughly every 8 minutes, call data from poison centers across the country are uploaded to a national reporting database and electronic surveillance system called the National Poison Data System (NPDS). CDC and America's Poison Centers use the database to improve surveillance of chemical exposures and public health hazards. How it works Scientists from CDC and America's Poison Centers monitor NPDS every day. They watch for any data anomalies that may represent incidents of public health significance such as outbreaks of illness. Anomalies can include an increase in the number of calls or an increase in reports of specific signs and symptoms.

After a disaster, there may be power outages. This can result in people using alternative sources of fuel or electricity for heating, cooling, or cooking. These sources can lead to elevated CO levels in enclosed spaces, poisoning people and animals inside. CDC uses NPDS for surveillance during disaster response and recovery efforts to track reported exposures to CO. Using these data can help inform public health messaging to prevent further injury and death. Identifying an increase in exposures to cleaners and disinfectants (2020) In April 2020, CDC published a report that described an increase in calls to poison centers about exposures to cleaners and disinfectants. Using data from NPDS, CDC and America's Poison Centers found that poison centers nationwide received 45,550 calls regarding exposures to cleaners and disinfectants during the first three months of 2020-an increase of about 20% from the same timeframe in 2019. The timing of these reported exposures corresponded to increased media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, reports of consumer shortages of cleaning and disinfection products, and the beginning of some local and state stay-at-home orders. The results of this study highlighted the importance of safe and appropriate use of cleaners and disinfectants to prevent potential poisonings and injuries. Identifying sources of harmful algal and cyanobacterial bloom exposures (2019) Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are the rapid growth of algae or cyanobacteria that can cause harm to people, animals, and the environment. In 2019, CDC and America’s Poison Centers worked with five poison centers to conduct follow-up surveys with people who had called regarding a HAB exposure. Fifty-five people were interviewed.",condition

The most frequently reported source of exposure was bathing or swimming in contaminated water. Few callers had heard or read warnings about the dangers of HABs before or during their exposure. This study highlights the importance of characterizing exposures to HABs to tailor public health messaging. Increasing awareness of synthetic cannabinoids (2015) CDC launched an investigation in April 2015 after being alerted to an increase in poison center calls related to synthetic cannabinoids, also known as synthetic marijuana. The results, published in MMWR , led to a surge in media coverage on this issue that created a broader awareness of issues and dangers of using synthetic cannabinoids. Reporting poisoning from electronic cigarettes (2014) Electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, are devices that heat a liquid mixture to allow users to inhale an aerosol that typically contains nicotine, flavorings, and other additives. While long-term impacts of these products on public health are unknown, one area of concern is the potential for poisonings. A CDC study found that 2,405 e-cigarette exposures were reported to poison centers from September 2010 to February 2014. This work informed public health actions including the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act of 2015, enacted in January 2016. This law requires any container of liquid nicotine that is sold, manufactured, distributed, or imported into the United States use packaging that is difficult for children under 5 years of age to open. Improving consumer safety for laundry pods (2012) From May 17–June 17, 2012, poison centers across the country reported 485 cases of children being exposed to detergent-filled laundry pods.

Tracking concerns during Japan radiological event (2011) CDC tracked all calls to poison centers related to the 2011 Japan nuclear event. Between March 11 and April 18, NPDS tracked 340 information requests and 64 calls regarding potential radiation, potassium iodide and iodide product exposures. Call details were analyzed daily for situational awareness and to inform public health response efforts. Staff from CDC and America’s Poison Centers performed detailed follow up and data review to confirm exposure status. Surveillance for calls related to potassium iodide (a medication used to prevent the uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid) exposures documented adverse outcomes in persons taking this product in response to a perceived risk from this event.

People who have never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine should get 2 doses. Most people who get the vaccine will be protected for life and not get chickenpox. Introduction The best way to protect against chickenpox is to get the chickenpox vaccine. The chickenpox vaccine prevents almost all cases of severe illness. Instead of MMRV, some children might receive separate vaccines for MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and varicella (chickenpox). If a vaccinated person does get chickenpox, called breakthrough chickenpox, the symptoms are usually mild. Vaccinated people often experience fewer to no blisters and low or no fever, but red spots may occur.

Child abuse and neglect can have long-term impacts on health, opportunity, and well-being. What are child abuse and neglect? Child abuse and neglect includes all types of abuse and neglect of a child under the age of 18 by a parent, caregiver, or another person in a custodial role (e.g., a religious leader, a coach, or a teacher) that results in harm, the potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child. There are four common types of abuse and neglect: Physical abuse is the intentional use of physical force that can result in physical injury. Examples include hitting, kicking, shaking, or other shows of force against a child. Sexual abuse refers to any completed or attempted sexual acts or sexual contact with a child by a caregiver. Examples include fondling, penetration, and exposing a child to other sexual activities. Read more information about child sexual abuse . Emotional abuse refers to behaviors that harm a child's self-worth or emotional well-being. Examples include name-calling, shaming, rejecting, and withholding love. Neglect is the failure to meet a child's basic physical and emotional needs. These needs include housing, food, clothing, education, access to medical care, and having feelings validated and appropriately responded to. 1 For more information about child abuse and neglect definitions please see Child Maltreatment Surveillance: Uniform Definitions for Public Health and Recommended Data Elements [4.12 MB, 148 Pages, 508] . Quick facts and stats Child abuse and neglect are common. At least one in seven children experienced child abuse or neglect in the past year in the United States. 2 This is likely an underestimate because many cases are unreported.

Rates of child abuse and neglect are five times higher for children in families with low socioeconomic status compared to families with a higher socioeconomic status. Child maltreatment is costly. In the United States, the total lifetime economic burden associated with child abuse and neglect was about $592 billion in 2018. 4 This economic burden rivals the cost of other high-profile public health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes. 5 Outcomes Children who are abused or neglected may suffer immediate physical injuries such as cuts, bruises, or broken bones. They may also have emotional and psychological problems, such as anxiety or posttraumatic stress. Over the long term, children who are abused or neglected are also at increased risk for experiencing future violence victimization and perpetration, substance abuse, sexually transmitted infections, delayed brain development, lower educational attainment, and limited employment opportunities. Abuse and neglect may result in toxic stress, which can change brain development and increase the risk for problems like posttraumatic stress disorder and learning, attention, and memory difficulties. 6 Prevention Child abuse and neglect can be prevented. Certain factors may increase or decrease the risk of perpetrating or experiencing child abuse and neglect. Preventing child abuse and neglect requires understanding and addressing the factors that put people at risk for or protect them from violence. 7 Everyone benefits when children have safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments.

Overview Arthritis that develops in children is called childhood arthritis (or juvenile arthritis). A 1 Childhood arthritis begins when the immune system becomes overactive, leading to joint and body swelling. Childhood arthritis can cause pain, loss of motion, and permanent damage in the joints. This can make it hard for a child to walk, play, or dress themselves. It can also result in disability. Living with childhood arthritis About 220,000 U.S. children under 18 have arthritis. 1 Childhood arthritis is more common among certain groups in the United States, including children who are Black or African American and whose parents have lower levels of education.

Compared to children with healthy weight, children with obesity are at a higher risk for asthma, sleep apnea, bone and joint problems, type 2 diabetes, and other health issues. While there is no one solution, there are many ways parents and caregivers can help children have a healthy weight and set up lifelong healthy habits. Why it matters About 1 in 5 American children have obesity. Compared to children with healthy weight, children with obesity are at a higher risk for asthma, sleep apnea, bone and joint problems, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and mental health concerns like depression and anxiety. Children with obesity are more likely to have obesity as adults. Adults with obesity have higher risks for stroke, many types of cancer , heart disease, type 2 diabetes, premature death and mental health issues. Factors that influence obesity include genes, eating patterns, physical activity levels, access to health care, and sleep routines. Also, conditions where we live, learn, work, and play affect access to healthy food and safe places to be physically active. Though there is no one solution to addressing obesity, there are many ways parents and caregivers can help children have a healthy weight and set up lifelong healthy habits at home. Here are a few ways families can help prevent or address obesity. 1. Model a healthy eating pattern Offer a variety of fruits and vegetables throughout the day. Frozen and canned fruits and vegetables are often less expensive than fresh and are still good for you. Look for low sodium or no salt added vegetables and fruits packed in water or 100% fruit juice. Adopting healthy eating patterns as a family can help children grow healthfully and maintain a healthy weight as they age.",prevention

Choose healthy drinks Help kids rethink their drink by replacing sugary drinks, such as soda, fruit drinks, and flavored milk, with water, 100% juice, or plain milk. Sugary drinks are the leading sources of added sugars in the American diet. Having too many sugary drinks can lead to weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and dental problems like cavities. The next time you go grocery shopping, read the nutrition labels on the items in your cart to see which ones have added sugars. You may be surprised to see the amount of added sugars in some drinks. Nutrition guidelines recommend that children younger than 2 years have zero foods or drinks with added sugars. From age 2 into adulthood, less than 10 percent of calories per day should come from added sugars. Keep Reading: Nutrition Facts Label and Your Health 2. Move more as a family Physically active youth have stronger muscles and bones, better cardiovascular fitness, and lower body fat than those who are inactive. Regular physical activity can also help improve attention and memory and reduce the risk of depression. Children aged 3–5 years should be physically active throughout the day. Guidelines recommend that children aged 6–17 years get at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day.

People who are sexually active can get chlamydia. This fact sheet answers basic questions about chlamydia. Overview What is chlamydia? Chlamydia is a common STI that can cause infection among men and women. It can cause permanent damage to a woman's reproductive system. This can make it difficult or impossible to get pregnant later. Chlamydia can also cause a potentially fatal ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy that occurs outside the womb). Signs and symptoms How do I know if I have chlamydia? Chlamydia often has no symptoms, but it can cause serious health problems, even without symptoms. Chlamydia often has no symptoms, but it can cause serious health problems, even without symptoms. If symptoms occur, they may not appear until several weeks after having sex with a partner who has chlamydia. Symptoms in women Even when chlamydia has no symptoms, it can damage a woman's reproductive system. Women with symptoms may notice: An abnormal vaginal discharge A burning sensation when peeing Symptoms in men Men with symptoms may notice: Penis discharge A burning sensation when peeing Pain and swelling in one or both testicles (although this is less common) Symptoms from rectal infections Men and women can also get chlamydia in their rectum. This happens either by having receptive anal sex, or by spread from another infected site (such as the vagina). While these infections often cause no symptoms, they can cause: Rectal pain Discharge Bleeding See your healthcare provider if you notice any of these symptoms. You should also see a provider if your partner has an STI or symptoms of one. Symptoms can include an unusual sore, a smelly discharge, burning when peeing, and bleeding between periods.

If you are sexually active, have an honest and open talk with your healthcare provider. Ask them if you should get tested for chlamydia or other STIs. How it spreads How is chlamydia spread? You can get chlamydia by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex without a condom with someone who has the infection. A pregnant woman with chlamydia can give the infection to her baby during childbirth. Prevention How can I reduce my risk of getting chlamydia? The only way to completely avoid STIs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex. If you are sexually active, the following things can lower your chances of getting chlamydia: Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and does not have chlamydia Using condoms the right way every time you have sex I'm pregnant. If I have chlamydia, how can I protect my baby from getting it? If you are pregnant and have chlamydia, you can give the infection to your baby during delivery. This can cause serious health problems for your baby. If you are pregnant, talk to your healthcare provider about getting the correct examination, testing, and treatment . Treating chlamydia as soon as possible will make health problems for your baby less likely. Testing and diagnosis Should I be tested for chlamydia? If you are sexually active, have an honest and open talk with your healthcare provider. Ask them if you should get tested for chlamydia or other STIs. If you are a sexually active gay or bisexual man, you should get tested for chlamydia every year. If you are a sexually active woman, you should get tested for chlamydia every year if you are: Younger than 25 years 25 years and older with risk factors, such as new or multiple sex partners, or a sex partner who has a sexually transmitted infection Testing is also recommended during pregnancy in some cases .",condition

Your healthcare provider may ask you to provide a urine sample for testing, or they might use (or ask you to use) a cotton swab to get a vaginal sample. Treatment and recovery Is there a cure for chlamydia? Yes, the right treatment can cure chlamydia . It is important that you take all of the medicine your healthcare provider gives you to cure your infection. Do not share medicine for chlamydia with anyone. When taken properly it will stop the infection and could decrease your chances of having problems later. Although medicine will stop the infection, it will not undo any permanent damage caused by the disease. Repeat infection with chlamydia is common. You should receive testing again about three months after your treatment, even if your sex partner(s) receives treatment. When can I have sex again after my chlamydia treatment? You should not have sex again until you and your sex partner(s) complete treatment. If given a single dose of medicine, you should wait seven days after taking the medicine before having sex. If given medicine to take for seven days, wait until you finish all the doses before having sex. If you've had chlamydia and took medicine in the past, you can still get it again. This can happen if you have sex without a condom with a person who has chlamydia. What happens if I don't get treated? The initial damage that chlamydia causes often goes unnoticed. However, chlamydia can lead to serious health problems. In women, untreated chlamydia can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Some of the complications of PID are: Formation of scar tissue that blocks fallopian tubes Ectopic pregnancy ( pregnancy outside the womb ) Infertility (not being able to get pregnant) Long-term pelvic/abdominal pain Men rarely have health problems from chlamydia.

Signs and symptoms of chlorine exposure depend on how you were exposed. Get away from the area, get clean, and get help if exposed. Chlorine can explode with many common substances. Overview Chlorine is a chemical element commonly used in some jobs and is found in some household products, like bleach. Chlorine has the following traits: Yellow-green gas under normal conditions Smells like bleach Dissolvable in water Liquid when pressurized and kept cool Chlorine is turned into a liquid for storage and transport. When liquid chlorine is released, it quickly turns into a gas that stays close to the ground and spreads quickly. Warning! Chlorine can explode or create explosive products with many common substances. They include: acetylene, ether, turpentine, ammonia, fuel gas, hydrogen, and finely divided metals. Signs and symptoms Most people will smell the chemical or feel irritation that tells you that you are exposed to chlorine. Exposure for a long time may affect people's ability to sense the chemical. Some people with asthma or other lung diseases may be more sensitive to breathing chlorine than others. Effects depend on how the person was exposed, how much they were exposed to, and how long they were exposed for. When chlorine gas touches moist tissues (like the eyes, throat, and lungs) it creates an acid that can hurt these tissues. If high amounts are breathed in, breathing problems may show up right away.",condition

Exposure Warning! Household chlorine bleach can release chlorine gas if it is mixed with certain other cleaning products. Do not mix household cleaners! If chlorine is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or breathing in the chlorine gas. If chlorine is in water, people can be exposed by touching or drinking water that contains chlorine. Because chlorine gas is heavier than air, it will sink to lower areas and increase the risk of exposure there. Chlorine in food Chlorine is unlikely to be eaten or drunk, because it has a very bad smell and taste. Do not use or eat food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual. Do not eat food that may have touched liquid chlorine if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an unbroken sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected by chlorine. Wash the outside of the container before using. Follow any directions by local authorities. What to do if you are exposed Get away Get away from the area where the chlorine was released and breathe fresh air. Outdoors If the chlorine release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place . Make sure windows are closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the chlorine does not come inside. If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the chlorine was released.

Leave the area until the gas has gone away. If you cannot get away, go to the highest ground possible because chlorine is heavier than air and will sink. Get clean Get clean by taking off all clothes, jewelry, and accessories and showering as soon as you can. Showering is the best method for removing chlorine from your body. If you cannot take off all layers, take off as many clothes as you can. Take your clothes off If clothes are frozen to your body, do not try to remove until no longer frozen. Instead, begin washing with a lot of lukewarm water. Then remove your clothes. Do not pull clothing over your head. If you must pull clothing over your head, close your eyes and mouth, and hold your breath. This will stop the chlorine from getting in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Put clothes in a plastic bag. Drop clothes to the floor. If you wear contact lenses, take them out and place them with your clothing. Do not put contact lenses back in. Wash your body Wash your hair, face, and hands, and then wash the rest of your body. Wash from your head to your feet, including armpits and groin, with lots of lukewarm water and mild soap for several minutes. Finish with a plain water rinse. Try not to let the water run into your eyes, nose, or mouth. Do not scrub! If your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, wash your eyes for 10–15 minutes with lukewarm water. Do not use eye drops. Dry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia (low body temperature). This is especially important if temperatures are cool. Clear the dirty items If emergency response services are available, leave used items on the floor and report where they are to emergency teams.

Place the bags in an area where other people are unlikely to disturb them and touch chlorine. Inform local authorities of the location of the bags for pick up. Get help Get help right away by calling 911, going to the hospital if local officials say it is safe to leave your home, or calling the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222. Treatment If someone has swallowed chlorine, do not force vomiting. No known cure exists for chlorine exposure. Treatment involves removing chlorine from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care. Symptoms can be treated in a hospital setting or by trained emergency personnel. Long-term health effects Short exposure Lung health usually returns to normal within 7 to 14 days. Although most people recover completely, symptoms and lung issues may continue for those more seriously exposed. Exposure to chlorine can lead to reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS), asthma caused by chemicals. Long term exposure This often occurs in the workplace. Teeth may be weakened.

The disease hasn't been shown to infect people. However, it might be a risk to people if they have contact with or eat meat from animals infected with CWD. Overview Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease that affects deer, elk, moose and similar animals. It has been reported in the United States, Canada, Norway, Finland, Sweden and South Korea. No CWD infections in people have ever been reported. And it's not known if people can even get infected with CWD. However, CWD is related to another prion disease in animals that does infect people. So, it is considered a theoretical risk to people. Some studies in monkeys suggest they can get CWD by eating meat or brain tissues of infected deer or elk. These studies raise concerns CWD may also pose a risk to people. Exposure risks In the United States, CWD was first identified in the 1960s in captive deer. In 1981, the first wild deer with CWD was reported. Since then, the disease has been reported in wild deer in more than half of U.S. states. It's possible that CWD is also in other states but hasn't been reported yet. Once the disease is established in an area, the CWD prions can stay in the environment (soil) for years. If CWD could spread to people, it would most likely be by eating meat from an infected animal. A CDC survey of U.S. residents showed nearly 1 in 5 said they had hunted deer or elk. More than 6 in 10 said they had eaten venison or elk meat. These groups would likely be most at risk if CWD spreads to people. Causes Chronic wasting disease is a type of prion disease. Prions are proteins that are normally found in the body. In rare cases, the proteins misfold, causing serious symptoms in the animal or person affected. Once a person or animal gets sick, the disease moves to the brain and spine and eventually leads to death.",condition
cdc_0196_2,Chronic Wasting Disease,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-wasting/about/index.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Scientists believe CWD proteins (prions) spread between animals through body fluids like feces, saliva, blood, or urine. This can occur either through direct contact or indirectly through contamination of soil, food or water. Reducing risk When hunting in areas with CWD activity, follow these steps to reduce your risk of contact with the disease: Do not shoot, handle or eat animals that look sick or act strangely. Do not touch or eat meat from animals found dead (roadkill) When field-dressing a deer or handling meat: Wear latex or rubber gloves Avoid handling its internal organs, especially the brain or spine. Do not use knives or other tools you use in your kitchen. Check state wildlife and health department recommendations before you hunt. See if they recommend or require testing animals for CWD in the hunting area. Recommendations vary by state. Strongly consider having the deer or elk tested for CWD before you eat the meat. If your deer is processed commercially, consider asking to have your animal be processed individually. This ensures you are only getting meat from your animal. If your animal tests positive for CWD, do not eat meat from that animal. What CDC is doing CDC has been working with health officials in states where CWD has been reported for decades. We are collaborating to watch for potential CWD cases in people. By surveying hunters' health in states with long CWD histories, we hope to have early warnings if it spreads to people.

cdc_0197_1,Classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/creutzfeldt-jakob/about/index.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"May 13, 2024 Classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease What to know Classic CJD is a quick-moving, always fatal disease that occurs worldwide. It affects the brain and causes dementia and other problems. CJD mostly occurs in older adults. There is no treatment or cure. It usually leads to death within a year from when symptoms begin. Overview CJD is caused by a prion, a type of infectious protein. Prions trigger normal proteins in the body to misfold, leading to CJD. CJD causes dementia and other neurologic problems. Once symptoms begin, it can lead to death in months to a year. Classic CJD occurs worldwide in older adults, with the average age in the late 60s. Very few cases occur in people who are younger than 30 years old. CJD occurs worldwide with an estimated rate of about one to two illness per one million population members per year. In recent years in the United States, about 500-600 cases have been reported per year. Types There are three main types of CJD infection: Sporadic The vast majority of all CJD cases reported (about 85 percent) are called sporadic. These types of cases occur when prion proteins already in the body misfold for some unknown reason. The result is disease that breaks down the brain's functions. Some cases are fatal within a few months of the first symptoms, and most are fatal within a year. Familial About 5-15 percent of CJD cases occur because the person has inherited a mutation in the prion protein gene. A person with CJD with a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) who also has the disease would have familial CJD. Iatrogenic Iatrogenic cases are caused by contact with prions in a healthcare setting or due to biological products. There have been six known CJD cases caused by surgical or medical equipment contaminated with prions is used on another patient. People who received prion-contaminated human growth hormone prior to 1978 may also develop iatrogenic CJD. Even 50 years later, cases are still being identified.",condition
cdc_0197_2,Classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/creutzfeldt-jakob/about/index.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Finally, cases can occur in people who receive a transplant of specific materials. These include corneal (eye) grafts or dura mater (a membrane in the brain and spinal cord) grafts. If the donor had CJD that was not discovered before the donation, recipients can contract CJD. How it affects your body People with CJD suffer from dementia. Other symptoms may include trouble walking, sudden jerky movements, and visual disturbances. CJD patients usually die within one year following the onset of symptoms. Testing and diagnosis Healthcare providers can diagnose an illness as a suspect case based on: Symptoms and course of illness Tests of a person's spinal fluid Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), a brain scan EEG, a test of electrical activity in the brain. The only way to confirm CJD is through testing brain tissue from a biopsy or an autopsy. Treatment and Prognosis Classic CJD is always fatal, usually within a few months. There is unfortunately no therapy that will slow or stop the progression of disease. So, treatment involves supportive care to make the patient more comfortable. Similar diseases Though they have very similar names, CJD and variant CJD (vCJD) are not the same disease. Both are prion diseases. However, variant CJD is tied to eating meat from cows infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (sometimes called Mad Cow Disease). CJD, sometimes called ""classic CJD"" to avoid confusion, mostly occurs sporadically. Unlike variant CJD, classic CJD is not caused by any other prion disease. In general, classic CJD affects people older than 55 while vCJD cases were younger, with an average age of 28. Classic CJD progresses much more quickly, causing death in an average of 4-5 months, while vCJD averages more than a year.

Complementary Versus Alternative According to a 2012 national survey, many Americans—more than 30 percent of adults and about 12 percent of children—use health care approaches that are not typically part of conventional medical care or that may have origins outside of usual Western practice. When describing these approaches, people often use “alternative” and “complementary” interchangeably, but the two terms refer to different concepts: If a non-mainstream approach is used together with conventional medicine, it’s considered “complementary.” If a non-mainstream approach is used in place of conventional medicine, it’s considered “alternative.” Most people who use non-mainstream approaches also use conventional health care. In addition to the terms complementary and alternative, you may also hear the term “functional medicine.” This term sometimes refers to a concept similar to integrative health (described below), but it may also refer to an approach that more closely resembles naturopathy (a medical system that has evolved from a combination of traditional practices and health care approaches popular in Europe during the 19th century).

It is grown in subtropical regions around the world, including the southern border areas of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. Aloe was used in ancient Greece, Rome, Babylonia, and China. Historically, it was used for skin conditions and was thought to prevent premature graying of hair and promote wound healing. Aloe is used topically (applied to the skin) and orally. Topical use of aloe is promoted for acne, psoriasis, lichen planus (a very itchy rash on the skin or in the mouth), oral submucous fibrosis (a disease that causes scars and tissue fibrosis and can involve a burning sensation in the mouth), burns, and skin damage from radiation therapy. Oral use of aloe is promoted for weight loss, diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease (a group of conditions caused by gut inflammation that includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis). Aloe products can be made from various parts of the aloe leaf, including the gel (from the inner leaf), latex (from the leaf’s outer layer), and whole crushed leaf (containing the gel and latex). In 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a ruling that required manufacturers to remove aloe latex from over-the-counter laxative products because of a lack of safety data. The International Agency for Re on Cancer has classified whole leaf extract of aloe vera as a possible carcinogen in humans. (This form, called non-decolorized, has not undergone activated carbon treatment to remove toxic anthraquinone components.) How Much Do We Know?

A small amount of re suggests that aloe taken orally may reduce blood sugar and HbA1c in people with diabetes. A small study showed that a specific aloe gel product taken orally for 8 weeks modestly reduced weight and fat mass in adults with obesity or overweight who had diabetes or prediabetes. There is interest in using aloe for many other conditions, but there isn’t enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful for those conditions, which include eczema, diabetic foot ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, and ulcerative colitis. What Do We Know About Safety? Topical use of aloe gel is generally well tolerated; however, there have been occasional reports of burning, itching, rash, and eczema. Re studies suggest that short-term use of oral aloe gel up to 42 days is safe. Oral use of aloe latex can cause abdominal pain, cramps, and diarrhea. Oral consumption of aloe leaf extracts (for as little as 3 weeks and as long as 5 years) has been related to cases of acute hepatitis. Some animal studies have noted an association between a non-decolorized extract of aloe vera leaf taken orally and gastrointestinal cancer in rats and mice; most toxicity and safety studies in animals have tested non-decolorized whole leaf extract of aloe vera, which is not commonly used by consumers.

It contains several bioactive compounds, including a group of substances known as withanolides. Withanolides have been associated with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Ashwagandha has been in use as a medicinal plant for thousands of years, especially in traditional Ayurvedic medicine. Currently, ashwagandha supplements are often promoted for stress and anxiety, sleep, male infertility, and athletic performance. These supplements typically contain ashwagandha root, leaf, or root/leaf extracts. Ashwagandha has also been promoted for COVID-19, but there is not sufficient high-quality evidence to support its use. How Much Do We Know? Many clinical trials (studies in people) have looked at the use of ashwagandha for a variety of health conditions. However, many of the studies have had small sample sizes and have used a variety of ashwagandha preparations. What Have We Learned? Re shows that some ashwagandha preparations may be effective for insomnia and stress. However, evidence is unclear about its effects on anxiety. There is some limited evidence that suggests that taking ashwagandha for 2 to 4 months may increase testosterone levels and sperm quality. There isn’t enough evidence to determine if ashwagandha is helpful for any other health conditions, such as asthma, athletic performance, cognitive function, diabetes, menopause, and female infertility. There is not enough high-quality evidence suggesting that ashwagandha is helpful in treating COVID-19. What Do We Know About Safety?

Although it is rare, there have been a number of cases that link liver injury to ashwagandha supplements. Ashwagandha should be avoided during pregnancy and should not be used while breastfeeding. Ashwagandha is not recommended for people who are about to have surgery, or for those who have autoimmune or thyroid disorders. There is evidence that ashwagandha might interact with some medications, including those for diabetes and high blood pressure, medicines that decrease the immune system response (immunosuppressants), sedatives, anti-seizure medications (anticonvulsants), and thyroid hormone medications.

It has been used as a calming agent in traditional Chinese medicine and as an adaptogen. (Adaptogenic herbs are thought to help the body resist physiological and psychological stress.) Asian ginseng is one of several types of ginseng. The terms “red ginseng” and “white ginseng” refer to Asian ginseng that is prepared in two different ways. The part of the plant most frequently used for health purposes is the root. Asian ginseng has been promoted for stress, cognitive function, flu, fatigue, athletic performance, diabetes, aging, asthma, anxiety, and other conditions. Asian ginseng contains many substances; those thought to be most important are called ginsenosides (or panaxosides). How Much Do We Know? The amount of re on Asian ginseng for various conditions has gradually increased over recent years. Most of the clinical trials have been small, with fewer than 200 participants, and shorter than 3 months. Larger multicenter studies that last longer than 3 months are needed to improve the clinical evidence of Asian ginseng for different conditions. What Have We Learned? A small amount of re has suggested that Asian ginseng may improve cognitive function, including abstract thinking, attention, arithmetic skills, and reaction time, in middle-aged adults but not in young adults. Any benefit from Asian ginseng on memory has appeared to depend on the addition of ginkgo.

However, not all re agrees on Asian ginseng’s possible benefits for fatigue. A 2022 review of 20 studies (1,295 participants) found that Asian ginseng improved many cardiometabolic factors in people with prediabetes and diabetes, including fasting blood glucose levels, total cholesterol, and certain inflammatory markers. But re on the use of Asian ginseng for improving blood sugar control in people with diabetes is overall inconclusive and conflicting. Some re shows that taking oral Asian ginseng seems to improve sexual function in people with erectile dysfunction (ED). Asian ginseng has also been studied in adults with symptoms of ED associated with an enlarged prostate, and one small study suggested it may improve some aspects of sexual function. The majority of re shows that Asian ginseng does not improve athletic performance. There is interest in using Asian ginseng for many other conditions, including aging, asthma, and anxiety, but there isn’t enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful for these conditions. What Do We Know About Safety? Short-term oral use (by mouth, up to 6 months) of Asian ginseng in recommended amounts appears to be safe for most people. However, questions have been raised about its long-term safety, and some experts recommend against its use for infants, children, and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

Its root has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine, often in combination with other herbs. Astragalus is considered an adaptogen, which is a natural substance theorized to stimulate the body’s resistance to physical, environmental, and emotional stress. Sometimes combined with other herbs, astragalus has been promoted as a dietary supplement for many conditions, including upper respiratory infections, allergic rhinitis (hay fever), asthma, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes. It’s also promoted to improve the response of the immune system. Topical use (application to the skin) of astragalus is promoted for wound healing. How Much Do We Know?

Recent scientific reviews have evaluated the re on astragalus for various conditions. A 2024 review of 20 studies (involving 953 adults with type 2 diabetes) found that taking astragalus in addition to the medicine metformin reduced fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1C more than metformin alone.

Its dark berries resemble blueberries. The berries and leaves of the bilberry plant have been used as medicine. Extracts from bilberry fruits and leaves have traditionally been used for conditions related to vision, elevated blood sugar levels, and several cardiovascular disorders. It has been reported that during World War II, British pilots ate bilberry jam, thinking it would improve their night vision. Although this may have been superstition or a deliberate hoax to help conceal improvements in radar, it prompted re on bilberry and night vision. Today, bilberry is promoted as a dietary supplement for eye conditions, circulatory problems, and other conditions. How Much Do We Know? Some re has been done in people on the effect of bilberry on various conditions, but many of the studies did not use rigorous methods and did not include enough study participants to allow definite conclusions to be reached.

Its fruit is too sour to eat raw, but the fruit, peel, and essential oils are used in cooking, as flavorings in beer and spirits, and to add aromas to perfumes. Bitter orange is currently promoted as a dietary supplement for weight loss, sports performance, and other uses. Bitter orange oil is used topically and in aromatherapy. The fruit of bitter orange contains p -synephrine and other naturally occurring chemicals. p -Synephrine is structurally similar to ephedrine, the main component in the herb ephedra, but p -synephrine has different pharmacologic properties (how it acts in the body). In 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the use of ephedrine alkaloids (compounds found in Ephedra sinica and some other plants) in dietary supplements because of safety concerns. Prior to the ban, ephedra was an ingredient in some dietary supplements promoted for weight loss, increased energy, and enhanced athletic performance. Bitter orange products became more popular after ephedra was taken off the market and have been promoted as ephedra alternatives. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has placed “synephrine (bitter orange)” on its current list of banned drugs, listing it as a stimulant. How Much Do We Know? Studies have been done on the effects of bitter orange on weight loss or athletic performance in people, but most of them were small, some were not scientifically rigorous, and many evaluated the effects of products that contain a combination of ingredients, making it difficult to distinguish the effects of bitter orange from those of the other components.

Several small studies have evaluated the effects of bitter orange, with or without caffeine, on athletic performance. The results were inconsistent, but most of the studies did not show a beneficial effect. It is unclear whether applying bitter orange oil to the skin is helpful for fungal infections of the skin (ringworm, athlete’s foot, or jock itch). The one study that tested bitter orange oil for these infections did not compare it to other treatments or a placebo, so the study’s results are difficult to interpret. Bitter orange oil has been used in aromatherapy for various conditions including anxiety and insomnia, but it is unclear whether this is beneficial. What Do We Know About Safety? Bitter orange is likely safe when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods. Bitter orange oil is generally well tolerated when used topically or in aromatherapy. Serious concerns have been raised about possible risks of dietary supplements containing bitter orange. Cases of serious medical events, including abnormal heart rhythms, heart attacks, and strokes, have been reported in people who had taken bitter orange products, but most of the products contained multiple ingredients rather than bitter orange alone. Therefore, it is unclear whether bitter orange (or its component p -synephrine) played a role in causing the events. Evidence regarding the effects of bitter orange on the cardiovascular system is inconclusive. Some studies indicate that bitter orange raises blood pressure and heart rate, but others do not.

Bromelain is promoted as a dietary supplement for a variety of purposes including postoperative pain after wisdom tooth extraction, sinusitis, osteoarthritis, and exercise-induced muscle soreness. Bromelain is used topically (applied to the skin) as a prescription drug in the treatment of serious burns. How Much Do We Know? A small number of studies have been done on the use of bromelain taken orally (by mouth) for reducing symptoms of sinusitis and reducing pain and swelling after wisdom tooth extraction. For other conditions, either very little re has been done or studies have only evaluated products that contain a mixture of bromelain and other ingredients, and therefore the effects of bromelain alone are unclear. In 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a drug product containing bromelain for topical use for debridement (removal of dead tissue or contaminants) of severe burns in adults. The product is also approved for this purpose in the European Union. What Have We Learned? There is not enough high-quality re to say whether oral bromelain should be recommended for sinusitis. Some studies suggest that oral bromelain might be helpful for reducing some symptoms associated with wisdom tooth surgery. Debridement with topical bromelain has been successfully administered by health professionals as an alternative to surgical debridement. What Do We Know About Safety? When taken orally, bromelain seems to be well tolerated. The most commonly reported side effects have been stomach upset and diarrhea.",natural_remedy

The name, butterbur, is attributed to the traditional use of its large leaves to wrap butter in warm weather. The names for this plant in some other languages translate as “rain hat” or “hat plant,” reflecting another use of the large leaves. Butterbur has been used for health purposes for many centuries. In the Middle Ages, the odor and smoke from burning butterbur roots were thought to fight plague. Today, butterbur is promoted as a dietary supplement for migraine, allergic rhinitis (hay fever), and other conditions. How Much Do We Know? There have been several studies of butterbur for migraines and allergic rhinitis (hay fever) in people, so we have some knowledge of its effects on these two conditions. What Have We Learned? A butterbur root extract may reduce the frequency of migraines in adults and children when taken orally. In 2012, the American Academy of Neurology recommended butterbur for preventing migraines. However, the Academy stopped recommending it in 2015 because of serious concerns about its safety. Studies of a butterbur leaf extract suggest that it may be helpful for symptoms of allergic rhinitis when taken orally. Little re has been done on butterbur for conditions other than migraine and allergic rhinitis, and no conclusions can be reached about its effects for other conditions. What Do We Know About Safety?

The two most common species are U. tomentosa and U. guianensis. Most commercial preparations of cat’s claw in the United States contain U. tomentosa . Indigenous people of the Amazon rainforest have used cat’s claw for centuries to ward off disease. Today, cat’s claw is promoted for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, viral infections, and other conditions. How Much Do We Know?

Today, chamomile is promoted for the common cold, indigestion, anxiety, insomnia, excessive crying in infants (colic), respiratory disorders such as cough and bronchitis, and many other conditions. It is also used topically for some skin conditions and as a mouthwash. How Much Do We Know? Studies of the effectiveness of chamomile for a variety of specific conditions have not produced sufficient reliable evidence to rate clinical usefulness. Also, some studies look at products made of chamomile plus other herbs, so it is difficult to know chamomile’s exact role from those studies. What Have We Learned? Some preliminary studies suggest that a chamomile dietary supplement might be helpful for generalized anxiety disorder and associated depression. Some re has found that products containing certain combinations of herbs that include chamomile may be of benefit for diarrhea in children and for infants with colic. But chamomile alone has not been shown to be helpful for these conditions. Small studies suggest that mouthwashes containing chamomile might prevent or treat swelling or irritation in the mouth resulting from radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or stem cell transplantation. There’s very little information on chamomile’s effect on insomnia. A 2019 review of chamomile use found one study on insomnia, which found no benefit from its use for this sleep disorder.

Cranberry has a history of traditional use in dyes, food, and medicine among Native Americans and later European settlers. Cranberry fruits and leaves were thought to have therapeutic effects on disorders of the bladder, stomach, blood, and liver, and on various conditions like wounds, diabetes, and scurvy. Today, cranberry is commonly promoted for urinary tract infections (UTIs) and recurrent UTIs. Cranberry products are promoted for these common infections in part because of a growing interest in nonantibiotic prevention strategies, given concerns about antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

However, ginkgo has not been shown to be effective for any of the conditions for which it has been studied. What Have We Learned? There’s no conclusive evidence that ginkgo is helpful for any health condition. Ginkgo has not been shown to be beneficial for preventing or slowing the progression of dementia. In three large studies in older adults with normal cognitive function or mild cognitive impairment, supplementation with ginkgo extract did not reduce the risk of dementia.

The first reported cases involved medicinal or dietary supplement products that had been extracted with alcohol or acetone, but other cases have involved kava beverages prepared with water. It has been suggested that the use of undesirable varieties (cultivars) of kava plants or inappropriate parts of the plant may be responsible for liver toxicity; other possibilities include the consumption of kava together with alcohol and the adulteration or contamination of kava products.",natural_remedy

Kava can cause digestive upset, headache, dizziness, and other side effects. Long-term use of high doses of kava may cause kava dermopathy, a condition that involves dry, scaly, flaky skin with reddened eyes and temporary yellow discoloration of the skin, hair, and nails. Kava should not be used together with other substances that have sedative effects, such as benzodiazepines or alcohol. If you take any type of medicine, talk with your health care provider before using kava or other herbal products; some herbs and medicines interact in harmful ways.

The name lavender comes from the Latin verb “lavare,” meaning “to wash.” Lavender’s popular scent has commonly been used as an ingredient in bath products, perfumes, and aromatherapy. Lavender is promoted as an oral (by mouth) dietary supplement for calming anxiety, stress, and other conditions. It is also promoted for aromatherapy and topical use (application to the skin). How Much Do We Know? Studies have been done on the use of lavender products for a variety of conditions, but more high-quality re is needed to reach reliable conclusions about its effectiveness. What Have We Learned? Studies have suggested that a lavender oil product, taken orally, might be beneficial for anxiety, including anxiety with co-occurring symptoms of depression. However, the re has several limitations, such as the small sample sizes of the studies, a lack of independent funding and testing, and a lack of participant diversity. Initial reports of small sample size have indicated that oral lavender capsules or lavender tea might reduce symptoms of depression in some people, but because the re is preliminary, it should be interpreted with caution. Topical (on the skin) lavender does not seem to have an effect on symptoms of depression. One preliminary study with seventy-two postmenopausal women aged 50-65 years suggested that a lavender oil product, taken orally, might offer some relief for menopause-related sexual dysfunction, but more reliable evidence is needed to confirm effects.

One preliminary study suggested that lavender syrup might reduce cough severity in people with COVID-19; however, more reliable evidence is needed to confirm any effects. What Do We Know About Safety? It is likely safe to consume lavender in the amounts typically used in foods. Oral lavender products might be safe in the short-term and in the amounts tested in studies of anxiety or other conditions. However, some people may experience adverse effects such as diarrhea, headache, nausea, or burping. Aromatherapy with lavender oil is considered possibly safe, but it may cause headache or coughing. Topical products containing lavender may cause allergic skin reactions in some people. A few cases of swelling of breast tissue have been reported in children who used topical products containing lavender. However, it’s unclear whether the lavender was responsible for the breast swelling, a condition that can have many causes.

It is used as a flavoring in candy, other foods, and tobacco products. Many “licorice” products sold in the United States do not contain actual licorice. Anise oil, which smells and tastes like licorice, is often used instead. Licorice root has a long history of use, going back to ancient Assyrian, Egyptian, Greek, Arab, Chinese, Tibetan, and Indian cultures. It was used in traditional medicine practices for coughing, asthma, and wound healing, as well as for diseases of the lungs, liver, and arteries. Today, licorice root is promoted as a dietary supplement for digestive, respiratory, and energy support. Topical (applied to the skin) licorice has been promoted for certain skin conditions. How Much Do We Know? Some studies of licorice in people have been completed, but there isn’t enough high-quality evidence to clearly support its use for any health condition. What Have We Learned? Licorice mouth rinse or gargle might reduce ulcer size and pain in people with recurrent canker sores, while topical licorice might reduce ulcer size only.

There’s no good evidence to support the use of licorice for COVID-19. What Do We Know About Safety? Licorice root is generally considered safe as a food ingredient. Licorice contains a component called glycyrrhizin, or glycyrrhizic acid, that can cause serious adverse effects, such as irregular heartbeat and cardiac arrest, especially when consumed in large amounts or in the long term. Even small amounts of glycyrrhizin from licorice root products have been linked to severe adverse effects in people who consume a lot of salt, in people with hypertension, and in people with heart or kidney conditions. Oral licorice products that do not contain glycyrrhizin (deglycyrrhizinated licorice) might be safe for up to 4 months. Topical licorice root may be safe to use in the short term, but it may cause skin irritation in some people. Interactions between licorice and corticosteroids have been reported. Consuming oral licorice extract in large amounts (about 250 grams of licorice per week) during pregnancy is unsafe and can increase the risk of delivery before gestational age of 38 weeks.

It is native to the West Indies and the southeast coast of North America. Its berries have been used for health purposes. Saw palmetto is promoted as a dietary supplement for urinary symptoms associated with an enlarged prostate gland (also called benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH), as well as for male pattern baldness, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (a frequently painful condition involving inflammation of the prostate), and other conditions. How Much Do We Know? Many studies have been conducted on the usefulness of saw palmetto for urinary tract symptoms associated with prostate enlargement in men. We know enough to conclude that saw palmetto is probably not helpful for this purpose. There is not enough evidence to determine whether saw palmetto is useful for other health purposes. More studies are needed before definitive conclusions can be made. What Have We Learned? A 2023 review of 27 studies on saw palmetto in men with BPH found that this herb, when administered alone, provides little or no benefit for BPH symptoms. Definite conclusions could not be reached about the effects of combinations of herbs that include saw palmetto. Two clinical trials funded by the National Institutes of Health, both of which evaluated saw palmetto alone, were included in this review. One tested a standard dose of saw palmetto; the other tested increasing doses of saw palmetto, up to three times the usual dose. In both studies, saw palmetto did not improve BPH symptoms. Because it had been suggested that saw palmetto products prepared using hexane extraction might be more effective than those prepared in other ways, the reviewers analyzed studies of these products and studies of other products separately.",natural_remedy

What Do We Know About Safety? Saw palmetto is well tolerated. It has been used safely in re studies for up to 3 years. Adverse effects are mild and infrequent; they may include digestive symptoms, dizziness, and headache. Saw palmetto does not appear to affect readings of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, even when taken in higher-than-usual amounts. PSA is a protein produced by the prostate gland.

Soybeans have long been cultivated in Asia. Currently, they are also produced in other parts of the world, including the United States. Common soy foods include tofu, miso, tempeh, edamame, and soy milk. In addition to its food uses, soy is available in dietary supplements. Soy supplements may contain soy protein, isoflavones (compounds similar in structure to the hormone estrogen), or other components. Soy products are promoted for high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, symptoms of menopause, and many other health conditions. How Much Do We Know? Many studies have been conducted on the safety and usefulness of soy products. We know enough to conclude that there are potential beneficial effects on blood cholesterol levels, menopausal hot flashes, breast cancer risk, bone density, and blood pressure. However, effects may vary for different types of soy products and in different populations. What Have We Learned? Consuming soy protein in place of other proteins may lower cholesterol levels to a small extent. Soy isoflavones may not have the same effect. Soy isoflavone supplements or soy protein may help to reduce the frequency and severity of menopausal hot flashes, but the effect may be small, and re results have not been completely consistent. Observational studies indicate that among Asian and Asian-American women, higher dietary intakes of soy are associated with a lower risk of breast cancer. The amounts of soy in Western diets, even among the highest consumers of soy, may be too low for this association to be observed.

Topical (applied to the skin) turmeric is promoted for osteoarthritis. How Much Do We Know? Many studies have been conducted on the safety and usefulness of turmeric or curcumin for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), osteoarthritis, and high cholesterol or other lipid disorders. We don’t know enough to definitively conclude if turmeric or curcumin is beneficial for any health purposes. Highly bioavailable formulations of curcumin, which enhance the body’s ability to absorb the curcumin, may harm your liver. What Have We Learned? It’s challenging to compare the available evidence on turmeric. Oral curcumin products vary in how much curcumin they actually contain, and they often contain substances from other plants, such as piperine from black pepper. Combining curcumin with piperine is one way to improve the bioavailability of curcumin.",natural_remedy

The initial evidence is positive; higher-quality evidence is needed to reach definitive conclusions, and more re is needed to understand the impact of bioavailability on curcumin’s effects. It’s unclear whether topical curcumin ointment has an effect on pain related to knee osteoarthritis. Initial re suggests that oral turmeric or curcumin might improve some NAFLD measures, but it’s unclear which specific measures are consistently improved. Initial re suggests that turmeric or curcumin in an oral or mouthwash formulation might improve symptoms of oral mucositis (tissue swelling and irritation in the mouth) related to cancer treatment. There isn’t enough evidence to definitively conclude whether oral turmeric or curcumin has beneficial effects on other health conditions. What Do We Know About Safety? Conventionally formulated oral turmeric or curcumin (not modified to enhance bioavailability) is likely safe in the recommended amounts for up to 2 or 3 months. Oral turmeric can cause adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting, acid reflux, stomach upset, diarrhea, or constipation. Topical curcumin can cause hives or itching. Many curcumin products with increased bioavailability are on the market, and liver damage has been reported in some people who have consumed these bioavailable formulations. If you notice any liver damage symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, poor appetite, dark urine, or jaundice, stop consuming turmeric or curcumin products immediately and talk with your health care provider.

Melatonin is a hormone that your brain produces in response to darkness. It helps with the timing of your circadian rhythms (24-hour internal clock) and with sleep. Being exposed to light at night can block melatonin production. Re suggests that melatonin plays other important roles in the body beyond sleep. However, these effects are not fully understood. Melatonin dietary supplements can be made from animals or microorganisms, but most often they’re made synthetically. The information below is about melatonin dietary supplements. What are the health benefits of taking melatonin? Melatonin supplements may help with certain conditions, such as jet lag, delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, some sleep disorders in children, and anxiety before and after surgery. Jet lag Jet lag affects people when they travel by air across multiple time zones. With jet lag, you may not feel well overall and you may have disturbed sleep, daytime tiredness, impaired functioning, and digestive problems. Re suggests that melatonin supplements may help with jet lag. This is based on medium-sized reviews from 2010 and 2014. Four studies that included a total of 142 travelers showed that melatonin may be better than a placebo (an inactive substance) in reducing overall symptoms of jet lag after eastward flights. Another study of 234 travelers on eastward flights looked at only sleep quality and found low-quality evidence that melatonin may be better than placebo for improving sleep quality. Two studies that included a total of 90 travelers showed that melatonin may be better than a placebo in reducing symptoms of jet lag after westward flights. Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD) People with DSWPD have trouble falling asleep at the usual times and waking up in the morning. They typically have difficulty getting to sleep before 2 to 6 a.m. and would prefer to wake up between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.",natural_remedy
nccih_0061_2,Melatonin,NCCIH (NIH),https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/melatonin,Public Domain,2026-01-11,"Melatonin supplements appear to help with sleep in people with DSWPD, but it’s uncertain whether the benefits outweigh the possible harms. This is based on a clinical practice guideline, a small review, and a more recent study. In 2015, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommended melatonin supplements given at specific times for DSWPD. The recommendation was a weak one, and it came with uncertainty about whether the benefits of melatonin outweigh its potential harms. A 2016 review that looked at a small number of people (52) from two studies showed that melatonin supplements reduced the time it took for people with DSWPD to fall asleep when compared to placebo. On average, it took about 22 minutes less for them to fall asleep. A 2018 randomized controlled trial that lasted 4 weeks and included 307 people with DSWPD found that taking melatonin 1 hour before the desired bedtime combined with going to bed at a set time led to several improvements. Those improvements included falling asleep an average of 34 minutes earlier, better sleep during the first third of the night, and better daytime functioning. Some sleep disorders in children Sleep problems in children can have undesirable effects on their behavior, daytime functioning, and quality of life. Children with certain conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are more prone to sleep problems than other children. There are no overall guidelines on the best approach to improving sleep in children. However, guidelines for specific conditions recommend behavioral treatments, such as good bedtime habits and parent education, as an initial treatment that may be supplemented with medicines. A 2019 review looked at 18 studies of melatonin supplements that included a total of 1,021 children. Most of the studies were small, and all were relatively brief (1 to 13 weeks).",natural_remedy

The effects of melatonin on behavior and daytime functioning, however, weren’t clear because the studies used different ways to measure these outcomes. The list below shows the review’s results on melatonin’s short-term effects for children with specific conditions. Children with ASD fell asleep 37 minutes earlier and slept 48 minutes longer. Children with ADHD fell asleep 20 minutes earlier and slept 33 minutes longer. Children with atopic dermatitis fell asleep 6.8 minutes earlier and slept 35 minutes longer. Children with chronic sleep-onset insomnia fell asleep 24 minutes earlier and slept 25 minutes longer. Because there aren’t many studies on children and melatonin supplements, there is a lot we don’t know about the use of melatonin in children. For example, there are uncertainties about what dose to use and when to give it, the effects of melatonin use over long periods of time, and whether melatonin’s benefits outweigh its possible risks. Because melatonin is a hormone, it’s possible that melatonin supplements could affect hormonal development, including puberty, menstrual cycles, and overproduction of the hormone prolactin, but we don’t know for sure. Because of these uncertainties, it’s best to work with a health care provider if you’re considering giving a child melatonin for sleep problems. Anxiety before and after surgery Anxiety before and after surgery happens in up to 80 percent of patients. Melatonin supplements appear to be helpful in reducing anxiety before surgery, but it’s unclear if it helps to lower anxiety after surgery. This is a based on a 2015 review.

Is melatonin helpful for preventing or treating COVID-19? Current re looking at the effects of melatonin on COVID-19 is only in the early stages. There are a few randomized controlled trials (studies evaluating melatonin in people) in progress. At this point, it is too soon to reach conclusions on whether melatonin is helpful for COVID-19. Does melatonin help with cancer symptoms? Studies of the effect of melatonin supplements on cancer symptoms or treatment-related side effects have been small and have had mixed results. Keep in mind that unproven products should not be used to replace or delay conventional medical treatment for cancer. Also, some products can interfere with standard cancer treatments or have special risks for people who’ve been diagnosed with cancer. Before using any complementary health approach, including melatonin, people who’ve been diagnosed with cancer should talk with their health care providers to make sure that all aspects of their care work together. Can melatonin help with insomnia? People with insomnia have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or both. When symptoms last a month or longer, it’s called chronic insomnia. According to practice guidelines from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (2017) and the American College of Physicians (2016), there’s not enough strong evidence on the effectiveness or safety of melatonin supplementation for chronic insomnia to recommend its use. The American College of Physicians guidelines strongly recommend the use of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as an initial treatment for insomnia.

The first review looked at 7 studies that included a total of 263 participants. The results suggested that (1) people taking melatonin may sleep about 24 minutes longer during the daytime, but (2) other aspects of sleep, such as time needed to fall asleep, may not change. The evidence, however, was considered to be of low quality. The other review looked at 8 studies (5 of which were also in the first review), with a total of 300 participants, to see whether melatonin helped promote sleep in shift workers. Six of the studies were high quality, and they had inconclusive results. The review did not make any recommendations for melatonin use in shift workers. Is it safe to take melatonin? For melatonin supplements, particularly at doses higher than what the body normally produces, there’s not enough information yet about possible side effects to have a clear picture of overall safety. Short-term use of melatonin supplements appears to be safe for most people, but information on the long-term safety of supplementing with melatonin is lacking. Also keep in mind: Interactions with medicines As with all dietary supplements, people who are taking medicine should consult their health care providers before using melatonin. In particular, people with epilepsy and those taking blood thinner medications need to be under medical supervision when taking melatonin supplements.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Headache is the most prevalent neurological manifestation in adults and one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. In children and adolescents, headaches are arguably responsible for a remarkable impact on physical and psychological issues, yet high-quality evidence is scarce. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched cross-sectional and cohort studies in Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases from January 1988 to June 2022 to identify the prevalence of headaches in 8-18 years old individuals. The risk of bias was examined with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scale. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of pediatric headache. Subgroup analyses based on headache subtypes were also conducted. RESULTS: Out of 5,486 papers retrieved electronically, we identified 48 studies that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of primary headaches was 11% for migraine overall [95%CI: 9-14%], 8% for migraine without aura (MwoA) [95%CI: 5-12%], 3% for migraine with aura (MwA) [95%CI:2-4%] and 17% for tension-type headache (TTH) [95% CI: 12-23%]. The pooled prevalence of overall primary headache in children and adolescents was 62% [95% CI: 53-70%], with prevalence in females and males of 38% [95% CI: 16-66%] and 27% [95% CI: 11-53%] respectively. After the removal of studies ranked as low-quality according to the JBI scale, prevalence rates were not substantially different. Epidemiological data on less common primary headaches, such as trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, were lacking. CONCLUSION: We found an overall remarkably high prevalence of primary headaches in children and adolescents, even if flawed by a high degree of heterogeneity.",research

Abstract: This systematic review summarizes the existing data on headache and pregnancy with a scope on clinical headache phenotypes, treatment of headaches in pregnancy and effects of headache medications on the child during pregnancy and breastfeeding, headache related complications, and diagnostics of headache in pregnancy. Headache during pregnancy can be both primary and secondary, and in the last case can be a symptom of a life-threatening condition. The most common secondary headaches are stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pituitary tumor, choriocarcinoma, eclampsia, preeclampsia, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. Migraine is a risk factor for pregnancy complications, particularly vascular events. Data regarding other primary headache conditions are still scarce. Early diagnostics of the disease manifested by headache is important for mother and fetus life. It is especially important to identify ""red flag symptoms"" suggesting that headache is a symptom of a serious disease. In order to exclude a secondary headache additional studies can be necessary: electroencephalography, ultrasound of the vessels of the head and neck, brain MRI and MR angiography with contrast ophthalmoscopy and lumbar puncture. During pregnancy and breastfeeding the preferred therapeutic strategy for the treatment of primary headaches should always be a non-pharmacological one. Treatment should not be postponed as an undermanaged headache can lead to stress, sleep deprivation, depression and poor nutritional intake that in turn can have negative consequences for both mother and baby. Therefore, if non-pharmacological interventions seem inadequate, a well-considered choice should be made concerning the use of medication, taking into account all the benefits and possible risks.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cervicogenic headache is a secondary headache, and manual therapy is one of the most common treatment choices for this and other types of headache. Nonetheless, recent guidelines on the management of cervicogenic headache underlined the lack of trials comparing manual and exercise therapy to sham or no-treatment controls. The main objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effectiveness of different forms of manual and exercise therapy in people living with cervicogenic headache, when compared to other treatments, sham, or no treatment controls. METHODS: Following the PRISMA guidelines, the literature search was conducted until January 2022 on MEDLINE, CENTRAL, DOAJ, and PEDro. Randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of manual or exercise therapy on patients with cervicogenic headache with headache intensity or frequency as primary outcome measures were included. Study selection, data extraction and Risk of Bias (RoB) assessment were done in duplicate. GRADE was used to assess the quality of the evidence. RESULTS: Twenty studies were included in the review, with a total of 1439 patients. Common interventions were spinal manipulation, trigger point therapy, spinal mobilization, scapulo-thoracic and cranio-cervical exercises. Meta-analysis was only possible for six manual therapy trials with sham comparators. Data pooling showed moderate-to-large effects in favour of manual therapy for headache frequency and intensity at short-term, small-to-moderate for disability at short-term, small-to-moderate for headache intensity and small for headache frequency at long-term.",research

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Tension-type headache is the most common primary headache, with a high prevalence and a considerable socioeconomic impact. Manual physical therapy techniques are widely used in the clinical field to treat the symptoms associated with tension-type headache. This systematic review aims to determine the effectiveness of manual and non-invasive therapies in the treatment of patients with tension-type headache. DEVELOPMENT: We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials in the following databases: Brain, PubMed, Web of Science, PEDro, Scopus, CINAHL, and Science Direct. Ten randomised controlled trials were included for analysis. According to these studies, manual therapy improves symptoms, increasing patients' well-being and improving the outcome measures analysed. CONCLUSIONS: Manual therapy has positive effects on pain intensity, pain frequency, disability, overall impact, quality of life, and craniocervical range of motion in adults with tension-type headache. None of the techniques was found to be superior to the others; combining different techniques seems to be the most effective approach.",research

Abstract: We here present evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of migraine. These guidelines, created by the Italian Society for the Study of Headache and the International Headache Society, aim to offer clear, actionable recommendations to healthcare professionals. They incorporate evidence-based recommendations from randomized controlled trials and expert-based opinions. The guidelines follow the GRADE approach for assessing the quality of evidence. The guideline development involved a systematic review of literature across multiple databases, adherence to Cochrane review methods, and a structured framework for data extraction and interpretation. Although the guidelines provide a robust foundation for migraine treatment, they also highlight gaps in current research, such as the paucity of head-to-head drug comparisons and the need for long-term outcome studies. These guidelines serve as a resource to standardize migraine treatment and promote high-quality care across different healthcare settings.",research

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Migraine headaches are chronic neurological diseases that reduce the quality of life by causing severe headaches and autonomic nervous system dysfunction, such as facial flushing, nasal stuffiness, and sweating. Their major treatment methods include medication and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT has been used for pain treatment and various psychogenic neurological diseases by reducing pain, disability, and emotional disorders caused by symptoms of mental illness and improving the understanding of mental health. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of CBT in treating migraines. Materials and Methods: Seven electronic databases were searched from the date of inception to December 2020. Randomized controlled studies (RCTs) using CBT as an intervention for migraine were included. The primary outcome of this study was to determine the frequency of migraines and the intensity of migraines on Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the frequency of drug use, Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS), and Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) index. The two authors independently conducted the data extraction and quality assessment of the included RCTs, and conducted meta-analysis with RevMan V.5.4. Results: Among the 373 studies, 11 RCTs were included in this systematic review. Seven out of the 11 RCTs were conducted in the USA, and four were conducted in the UK, Germany, Iran, and Italy, respectively. Headache frequency and MIDAS scores were statistically significant reduced. In the subgroup analysis, headache strength was significantly reduced. Two of the included studies reported adverse effects, including worsening of migraine intensity and frequency, respiratory symptoms, and vivid memory of a traumatic event.",research

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To provide updated evidence-based recommendations about when to obtain neuroimaging in patients with migraine. METHODS: Articles were included in the systematic review if they studied adults 18 and over who were seeking outpatient treatment for any type of migraine and who underwent neuroimaging (MRI or CT). Medline, Web of Science, and Cochrane Clinical Trials were searched from 1973 to August 31, 2018. Reviewers identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the quality of the evidence in duplicate. We assessed study quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 2269 publications. Twenty three articles met inclusion criteria and were included in the final review. The majority of studies were retrospective cohort or cross-sectional studies. There were 4 prospective observational studies. Ten studies evaluated the utility of CT only, 9 MRI only, and 4 evaluated both. Common abnormalities included chronic ischemia or atrophy with CT and MRI scanning, and non-specific white matter lesions with MRI. Clinically meaningful abnormalities requiring intervention were relatively rare. Clinically significant neuroimaging abnormalities in patients with headaches consistent with migraine without atypical features or red flags appeared no more common than in the general population. RECOMMENDATIONS: There is no necessity to do neuroimaging in patients with headaches consistent with migraine who have a normal neurologic examination, and there are no atypical features or red flags present.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pharmacological treatment is the primary approach in chronic migraine (CM), although non-drug interventions such as physical therapy are used as adjunct treatments. We aimed to review the efficacy of physical therapy and rehabilitation approaches for CM and their impact on quality of life (QoL) and disability. METHODS: This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with CM. The primary outcomes were changes in intensity, frequency, duration of headache, disability, and QoL. Methodological quality was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. Data synthesis and quantitative analysis were conducted on relevant studies. RESULTS: Seven RCTs were included in the narrative review, and five of them were eligible for quantitative analysis. Aerobic exercise (AE), osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), occipital transcutaneous electrical stimulation (OTES), acupressure, hydrotherapy, instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM), facial proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (FPNF), and connective tissue massage (CTM) were used in CM. AE combined with pharmacological therapy reduced the frequency, duration, and intensity of headache. OMT combined with medication improved QoL and reduced disability, intensity of pain, and migraine days per month. Hydrotherapy combined with medication also resulted in improvements in the intensity of headache, frequency, and overall QoL. IASTM and OTES reduced the intensity of headache, alleviated neck pain, and improved QoL, although there were conflicting findings following OTES alone on disability and intensity of headache.",research

Abstract: Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most common type of headache worldwide. It is defined and classified according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders. TTH is treated with over-the-counter medications, mostly paracetamol or ibuprofen. The purpose was to assess the effectiveness of paracetamol versus ibuprofen in treating episodic tension-type headache (ETTH) through direct and indirect comparisons of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We included RCTs comparing paracetamol with a placebo, ibuprofen with a placebo, or paracetamol with ibuprofen for acute ETTH treatment that were published between 1988 and 2022. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Web of Science. The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias. We identified 14 studies including 6521 people with ETTH. None of the studies had a low risk of bias for all domains; this was most likely due to inadequate reporting and a small sample size. Ibuprofen (odds ratio (OR): 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17-2.56) showed better efficacy than paracetamol (OR: 1.62, 95% CI 1.24-2.13) for pain-free status at 2 h, while paracetamol (OR: 1.42, 95% CI 0.87-2.30) showed better efficacy than ibuprofen (OR: 1.20, 95% CI 0.58-2.48) for pain-free status at 1 h. Paracetamol was associated with the lowest likelihood of rescue medication use (OR: 0.49, 95% CI 0.37-0.65). Ibuprofen was associated with a lower likelihood of the occurrence of any events and gastrointestinal adverse events compared with placebo and paracetamol (OR: 0.95, 95% CI 0.64-1.41 and OR: 0.81, 95% CI 0.44-1.50, respectively).",research

Published: Jul 2024

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) plays a crucial role in metabolic disorders by enhancing insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon release, and slowing gastric emptying, thereby improving glycemic control. In recent years, GLP-1 role in neuronal pathways has expanded its therapeutic potential. We aim to comprehensively evaluate the relevance of GLP-1 in headache and pain disorders. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed and Embase (Ovid) databases using the search terms ""GLP-1"" and ""pain"". Animal and human studies published in English language were included. Abstracts, reviews, and articles on other disorders than ""pain"" were excluded. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 833 hits, of which 42 studies were included in the final review. The studies were categorized into four groups: inflammatory pain and osteoarthritis, headaches, neuropathic pain and diabetic neuropathy, and visceral pain and irritable bowel syndrome. GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, like liraglutide, have shown analgesic effects by modulating pain hypersensitivity in animal models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. GLP-1 is involved in migraine mechanisms and GLP-1R agonists are beneficial in individuals with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Additionally, GLP-1R agonists reduce visceral hypersensitivity and ameliorate symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic scope of GLP-1R agonists is expanding beyond traditional metabolic targets, highlighting its potential for headache and pain disorders. Engineering bimodal molecules that integrate GLP-1R agonism with specific pain-related mechanisms may offer innovative therapeutic options.",research

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To update and appraise the efficacy of physiotherapy for adults with cervicogenic headache. LITERATURE SURVEY: Bibliographic searches were conducted up to October 2021 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), assessing the efficacy of physiotherapy interventions for adults with cervicogenic headache, in five databases: CINAHL, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), PubMed, Sage Journals, and Wiley Online Library. METHODOLOGY: Data extraction of included trials was conducted by two reviewers according to a standardized extraction form. The PEDro tool and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach were used for grading evidence. Results from trials with similar interventions and with similar outcome measures were pooled into separate meta-analyses. A qualitative synthesis was performed for studies that were not pooled into meta-analyses. SYNTHESIS: Fourteen trials were included. Moderate-certainty evidence indicates that manual therapy significantly reduces headache frequency (mean difference [MD]: -0.93 episodes/week; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.40 to -0.46; 2 RCTs; n = 265) compared to sham manual therapy, and headache frequency (MD: -1.23 episodes/week; 95% CI: -1.55 to -0.91; 3 RCTs; n = 126) and intensity (MD: -1.63/10; 95% CI: -2.15 to -1.10; 4 RCTs; n = 208) compared to no treatment in the short term. At 12-month follow-up, moderate-certainty evidence indicates that manual therapy did not lead to greater reduction in headache intensity (MD Visual Analog Scale 0-10: -0.12; 95% CI: -0.49 to 0.26; 2 RCTs; n = 265) or frequency (MD: -0.32 episodes/week; 95% CI: -0.91 to 0.28; 2 RCTs; n = 265) when compared to a sham manual therapy.",research

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Non-pharmacological treatment of patients with headache, such as dry needling (DN), is associated with less morbidity and mortality and lower costs than pharmacological treatment. Some of these techniques are useful in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to review the level of evidence for DN in patients with headache. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of randomised clinical trials on headache and DN on the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and PEDro databases. Methodological quality was evaluated with the Spanish version of the PEDro scale by 2 independent reviewers. RESULTS: Of a total of 136 studies, we selected 8 randomised clinical trials published between 1994 and 2019, including a total of 577 patients. Two studies evaluated patients with cervicogenic headache, 2 evaluated patients with tension-type headache, one study assessed patients with migraine, and the remaining 3 evaluated patients with mixed-type headache (tension-type headache/migraine). Quality ratings ranged from low (3/10) to high (7/10). The effectiveness of DN was similar to that of the other interventions. DN was associated with significant improvements in functional and sensory outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Dry needling should be considered for the treatment of headache, and may be applied either alone or in combination with pharmacological treatments.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Migraine and cervicogenic headache (CGH) are common headache disorders, although the large overlap of symptoms between them makes differential diagnosis challenging. To strengthen differential diagnosis, physical testing has been used to examine for the presence of musculoskeletal impairments in both conditions. This review aimed to systematically evaluate differences in physical examination findings between people with migraine, CGH and asymptomatic individuals. METHODS: The databases MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE were searched from inception until January 2020. Risk of bias was assessed with the Downs and Black Scale for non-randomized controlled trials, and with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool for diagnostic accuracy studies. When possible, meta-analyses with random effect models was performed. RESULTS: From 19,682 articles, 62 studies were included in this review and 41 were included in the meta-analyses. The results revealed: a) decreased range of motion [°] (ROM) on the flexion-rotation test (FRT) (17.67, 95%CI:13.69,21.65) and reduced neck flexion strength [N] (23.81, 95%CI:8.78,38.85) in CGH compared to migraine; b) compared to controls, migraineurs exhibit reduced flexion ROM [°] (- 2.85, 95%CI:-5.12,-0.58), lateral flexion ROM [°] (- 2.17, 95% CI:-3.75,-0.59) and FRT [°] (- 8.96, 95%CI:-13.22,-4.69), reduced cervical lordosis angle [°] (- 0.89, 95%CI:-1.72,-0.07), reduced pressure pain thresholds over the cranio-cervical region [kg/cm CONCLUSION: The FRT and neck flexion strength could support the differential diagnosis of CGH from migraine.

Abstract: Post-dural puncture headache is one of the most undesirable complications of spinal anaesthesia. Previous pairwise meta-analyses have either compared groups of needles or ranked individual needles based on the pooled incidence of post-dural puncture headache. These analyses have suggested both the gauge and needle tip design as risk-factors, but failed to provide an unbiased comparison of individual needles. This network meta-analysis compared the odds of post-dural puncture headache with needles of varying gauge and tip design. We searched randomised controlled trials in medical databases. The primary outcome measure of the network meta-analysis was the incidence of post-dural puncture headache. Secondary outcomes were procedural failure, backache and non-specific headache. Overall, we compared 11 different needles in 61 randomised controlled trials including a total of 14,961 participants. The probability of post-dural puncture headache and procedural failure was lowest with 26-G atraumatic needles. The 29-G cutting needle was more likely than three atraumatic needles to have the lowest odds of post-dural puncture headache, although with increased risk of procedural failure. The probability rankings were: 26 atraumatic > 27 atraumatic > 29 cutting > 24 atraumatic > 22 atraumatic > 25 atraumatic > 23 cutting > 22 cutting > 25 cutting > 27 cutting = 26 cutting for post-dural puncture headache; and 26 atraumatic > 25 cutting > 22 cutting > 24 atraumatic > 22 atraumatic > 25 atraumatic > 26 cutting > 29 cutting > 27 atraumatic = 27 cutting for procedural success. Meta-regression by type of surgical population (obstetric/non-obstetric) and participant position (sitting/lateral) did not alter these rank orders.",research

Abstract: (1) Objective: The aim of this study is to synthesize the effects of physical therapy on pain, frequency, or duration management in the short, medium, and long term in adult patients diagnosed with Tension-type headache (TTH). (2) Background: Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most common headache with migraine and its pathophysiology and treatment has been discussed for years without reaching a consensus. (3) Methods: A systematic review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020175020). The systematic search for clinical trials was performed in the databases PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PEDro, Scopus, SciELO and Dialnet. Articles were selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, regarding the effectiveness of physical therapy interventions on adult patients with TTH published in the last 11 years with a score ≥ 6 in the PEDro Scale (Physiotherapy Evidence Database). (4) Results: In total, 120 articles were identified, of which 15 randomized controlled trials were finally included in order to determine the inclusion criteria. Changes in pain intensity, headache frequency or headache duration of individual studies were described (5) Conclusions: This systematic review shows that there is no standardized physical therapy protocol for the approach to tension headache, although all the techniques studied to date address in one way or another the cranio-cervical-mandibular region. The approach to the cranio-cervical-mandibular region reports significant effects in terms of decreasing the intensity of pain and frequency of headache episodes in the short and medium term.",research

Published: Apr 2025

Abstract: We here present evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of migraine. These guidelines, created by the Italian Society for the Study of Headache and the International Headache Society, aim to offer clear, actionable recommendations to healthcare professionals. They incorporate evidence-based recommendations from randomized controlled trials and expert-based opinions. The guidelines follow the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach for assessing the quality of evidence. The guideline development involved a systematic review of literature across multiple databases, adherence to Cochrane review methods, and a structured framework for data extraction and interpretation. Although the guidelines provide a robust foundation for migraine treatment, they also highlight gaps in current research, such as the paucity of head-to-head drug comparisons and the need for long-term outcome studies. These guidelines serve as a resource to standardize migraine treatment and promote high-quality care across different healthcare settings.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This systematic review focuses on chronic migraine patients with medication overuse headache using, respectively, topiramate, botulinum toxin type A, and human monoclonal antibodies targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide or its receptor. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in the databases CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science until May 2022. We included randomized controlled trials reporting the outcomes of change in monthly headache/migraine days, ≥50% response rates and change in medication overuse status. Studies were excluded if response rates were not reported. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane RoB2 tool. The quality of evidence for outcomes across included studies was evaluated according to the five factors outlined in Cochrane GRADE approach. FINDINGS: The initial search resulted in 1599 records. Following screening, 10 studies met our inclusion criteria, while seven studies with sufficient data were included in the meta-analysis. Studies assessing Botulinum toxin type A included 1139 patients and showed a mean reduction in headache frequency by 1.92 days per month compared to placebo (-1.92; 95% CI -2.68 to -1.16). Studies assessing human monoclonal antibodies included 1982 patients, and showed significant positive effect compared to placebo for all measured outcomes. The overall odds ratio for the ≥50% response rate was 2.90 (95% CI, 2.23 to 3.78). No significant difference was observed in the frequency of adverse effect for both Botulinum toxin type A and low dose of human monoclonal antibodies compared to placebo.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This systematic review assesses the effectiveness of physiotherapy on headache parameters and quality of life of patients with tension-type headache using network meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in the databases Web of Science, Medline, Cochrane Library and Physiotherapy Evidence Database up to August 2021. Randomised controlled trials investigating the effect of physiotherapy on tension-type headache were included. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Risk of bias tool 2.0. Results were presented according to the Cochrane handbook and the PRISMA statement. RESULTS: Twenty reports were eligible and 15 were included in network meta-analysis for pain intensity and frequency. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation combined with physiotherapy was the most effective approach to reduce pain intensity compared to control (mean difference (MD): -4.18, moderate confidence) and usual care (MD: -3.8, moderate confidence) Manual therapy (joint mobilisation) plus exercise was the most effective intervention to reduce headache frequency compared to control (MD: -13.03, low confidence) and usual care (MD: -13.95, moderate confidence). CONCLUSION: Results suggest a combination of passive physiotherapy techniques with exercise and/or transcutaneous electrical stimulation as the most effective physiotherapy intervention to reduce pain intensity and frequency in the short term. More research is needed to investigate mid-term and long-term effects.",research

Published: Dec 2021

Abstract: Background: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are among the most common and feared side effects of cancer treatments. Their presence has a negative impact on the quality of life and morbidity associated with the disease. Despite increasingly effective antiemetic treatments, 40% of cancer patients experience CINV during the acute or delayed phase of their treatment. This distressing experience lived through by a large number of people makes it a priority in the improvement of cancer patients and a daily concern for nurses in cancer care units. In an attempt to alleviate this problem, the idea of using aromatherapy as supportive care has led the authors to research the knowledge available on this subject. Objective: The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the existing scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of respiratory aromatherapy on CINV in addition to standard treatment compared with their recommended management in people with cancer. Design: Systematic review. Methods: This review was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines and queried six databases (PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Database, Embase, CINAHL, and Google Scholar). An analysis of the risk of bias using the Cochrane ""Risks of Bias"" tools and a qualitative synthesis of the results of the studies were carried out. Results: Eleven studies were included, nine in adults and two in children. Seven out of nine studies showed statistically significant results in adults with either direct or dry inhalation. Four out of seven alleviated both nausea and vomiting thanks to peppermint, ginger essential oil; three decreased nausea only with chamomilla, ginger or cardamom essential oil.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pregnant women commonly experience challenging nausea and vomiting, which significantly affect their general well-being and daily life. Although medication is often used for relief, it may not alleviate symptoms completely, emphasizing the need for complementary therapies. Acupuncture is one of the complementary treatments for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP). Studying the outcomes of acupuncture for NVP can shed light on this issue and inform treatment guidelines. Therefore, we systematically evaluated the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in managing NVP, considering the traditional meridian and acupoint theories. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry were searched on May 1, 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared acupuncture for NVP with sham acupuncture, placebo, and Western medicine (WM) or acupuncture plus WM with WM alone were included. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.4.1, and the quality of evidence for each outcome was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of the benefits and adverse events (AEs) of cannabinoids. DATA SOURCES: Twenty-eight databases from inception to April 2015. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials of cannabinoids for the following indications: nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy, appetite stimulation in HIV/AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity due to multiple sclerosis or paraplegia, depression, anxiety disorder, sleep disorder, psychosis, glaucoma, or Tourette syndrome. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. All review stages were conducted independently by 2 reviewers.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aims to assess the impact of nonpharmacological nursing interventions on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). DESIGN: This is a systematic review. METHODS: MEDLINE, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Tübitak-ULAKBİM, and TRDizin databases were searched for the following search terms, including ""Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting,"" ""Nurse,"" ""Nursing,"" and ""Nonpharmacological Interventions"" to identify nonpharmacological nursing interventions for PONV. A systematic review of English and Turkish articles published in the period between January 1, 2012 and June 1, 2023 was conducted. The PICOT-SD method was used to determine the compatibility of the pieces with the eligibility criteria. FINDINGS: Fifty-eight of 3,874 articles obtained from databases fulfilled the eligibility criteria. This study demonstrated that acupuncture, aromatherapy, the oral intake of ginger, listening to music, education, and visits to patients decreased the incidence of nausea and vomiting and increased the quality of life. Additionally, it was found that patients' quality of life tended to improve along with reductions in postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support previous findings in the literature and demonstrate that nonpharmacological nursing interventions help reduce and prevent PONV. Based on our results, we suggest that nonpharmacological nursing interventions can be employed for the management of PONV in patients undergoing surgery.",research

Abstract: Although prophylactic antiemetics are commonly used perioperatively, an estimated 30% of surgical patients still suffer from postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Very few prospective trials have studied rescue treatment of PONV after failure of prophylaxis, providing limited evidence to support clinical management. In patients who have failed PONV prophylaxis, administering a rescue antiemetic from the same drug class has been reported to be ineffective. For many antiemetics currently used in PONV rescue, significant uncertainty remains around the effective dose range, speed of onset, duration of effect, safety, and overall risk-benefit ratio. As prompt, effective PONV rescue after failure of prophylaxis is important to optimize postoperative recovery and resource utilization, we conduct this systematic review to summarize the current evidence available on the topic.",research

Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Nausea and vomiting affects approximately 85% of pregnant women. The most severe form, hyperemesis gravidarum, affects up to 3% of women and can have significant adverse physical and psychological sequelae. OBJECTIVE: To summarize current evidence on effective treatments for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Databases were searched to June 8, 2016. Relevant websites and bibliographies were also searched. Titles and abstracts were assessed independently by 2 reviewers. Results were narratively synthesized; planned meta-analysis was not possible because of heterogeneity and incomplete reporting of findings. FINDINGS: Seventy-eight studies (n  = 8930 participants) were included: 67 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and 11 nonrandomized studies. Evidence from 35 RCTs at low risk of bias indicated that ginger, vitamin B6, antihistamines, metoclopramide (for mild symptoms), pyridoxine-doxylamine, and ondansetron (for moderate symptoms) were associated with improved symptoms compared with placebo. One RCT (n = 86) reported greater improvements in moderate symptoms following psychotherapy (change in Rhodes score [range, 0 {no symptoms} to 40 {worst possible symptoms}], 18.76 [SD, 5.48] to 7.06 [SD, 5.79] for intervention vs 19.18 [SD, 5.63] to 12.81 [SD, 6.88] for comparator [P < .001]). For moderate-severe symptoms, 1 RCT (n = 60) suggested that pyridoxine-doxylamine combination taken preemptively reduced risk of recurrence of moderate-severe symptoms compared with treatment once symptoms begin (15.4% vs 39.1% [P < .04]).",research

Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), with a specific intention on exploring sources of between-study variation in treatment effects. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodicals Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared acupuncture to sham acupuncture or usual care (UC). The main outcome is complete control (no vomiting episodes and/or no more than mild nausea) of CINV. GRADE approach was used to rate the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: Thirty-eight RCTs with a total of 2503 patients were evaluated. Acupuncture in addition to UC may increase the complete control of acute vomiting (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.25; 10 studies) and delayed vomiting (RR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.00; 10 studies) when compared with UC only. No effects were found for all other review outcomes. The certainty of evidence was generally low or very low. None of the predefined moderators changed the overall findings, but in an exploratory moderator analysis we found that an adequate reporting of planned rescue antiemetics might decrease the effect size of complete control of acute vomiting (p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture in addition to usual care may increase the complete control of chemotherapy-induced acute vomiting and delayed vomiting but the certainty of evidence was very low. Well-designed RCTs with larger sample sizes, standardized treatment regimens, and core outcome measures are needed.",research

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess its impact on these symptoms to facilitate practical guidelines establishment. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Embase were searched for articles published until April 30, 2023. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effect of aromatherapy on nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer (age ≥18 years). The effect size was calculated using standardized mean differences (SMDs) with a random effects model. Subgroup analyses, meta-analysis of variance, and meta-regression were performed using the ""meta"" package in R version 4.0.2. Heterogeneity was assessed using I RESULTS: Twenty-five RCTs across 10 articles revealed that aromatherapy reduced overall nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer with significant efficacy (SMD = -0.81, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: -1.11 to -0.52). Furthermore, aromatherapy reduced nausea (SMD = -0.85, 95 % CI: -1.23 to -0.46) and combined nausea and vomiting (SMD = -1.08, 95 % CI: -1.68 to -0.47), but not vomiting alone (SMD = -0.24, 95 % CI: -1.03 to 0.55). Inhalation and massage yielded positive results, especially in chemotherapy-induced cases; peppermint oil was particularly successful. CONCLUSION: Our findings underscore aromatherapy's value in managing cancer treatment-associated nausea and vomiting.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To identify effective and safe interventions to prevent acute phase chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in adult and pediatric patients. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of randomized trials evaluating interventions to prevent acute CINV. Outcomes assessed were complete chemotherapy-induced vomiting (CIV) control, complete chemotherapy-induced nausea (CIN) control, complete CINV control, and discontinuation of antiemetics due to adverse effects. RESULTS: The search identified 65,172 citations; 744 were evaluated at full-text, and 295 (25 pediatric) met eligibility criteria. In patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC), complete CIV (risk ratio (RR) 1.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.44) and CIN (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.10-1.62) control improved when olanzapine was added. The addition of a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist (NK1RA) to a corticosteroid plus a serotonin-3 receptor antagonist (5HT3RA) also improved complete CIV (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.08-1.14) and CIN (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.08) control. Compared to granisetron/ondansetron, palonosetron provided improved complete CIV control when the 5HT3RA was given alone or when combined with dexamethasone. In patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC), dexamethasone plus a 5HT3RA improved complete CIV control compared to a 5HT3RA alone (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.21-1.39). Only a single meta-analysis evaluating the safety outcome was possible. CONCLUSIONS: For patients receiving HEC, various antiemetic regimens improved CIV and CIN control. For patients receiving MEC, administration of a 5HT3RA plus dexamethasone improved CIV control. Analysis of antiemetic safety was constrained by lack of data.",research

Abstract: Answer questions and earn CME/CNE Patients with breast cancer commonly use complementary and integrative therapies as supportive care during cancer treatment and to manage treatment-related side effects. However, evidence supporting the use of such therapies in the oncology setting is limited. This report provides updated clinical practice guidelines from the Society for Integrative Oncology on the use of integrative therapies for specific clinical indications during and after breast cancer treatment, including anxiety/stress, depression/mood disorders, fatigue, quality of life/physical functioning, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, lymphedema, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, pain, and sleep disturbance. Clinical practice guidelines are based on a systematic literature review from 1990 through 2015. Music therapy, meditation, stress management, and yoga are recommended for anxiety/stress reduction. Meditation, relaxation, yoga, massage, and music therapy are recommended for depression/mood disorders. Meditation and yoga are recommended to improve quality of life. Acupressure and acupuncture are recommended for reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Acetyl-L-carnitine is not recommended to prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy due to a possibility of harm. No strong evidence supports the use of ingested dietary supplements to manage breast cancer treatment-related side effects. In summary, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the use of integrative therapies, especially mind-body therapies, as effective supportive care strategies during breast cancer treatment.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Managing postoperative pain in patients with obesity is challenging. Although multimodal analgesia has proved effective for pain relief, the specific impacts of different nonopioid i.v. analgesics and adjuvants on these patients are not well-defined. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, paracetamol, ketamine, α-2 adrenergic receptor agonists, lidocaine, magnesium, and oral gabapentinoids in reducing perioperative opioid consumption and, secondarily, in mitigating the occurrence of general and postoperative pulmonary complications (POPCs), nausea, vomiting, PACU length of stay (LOS), and hospital LOS among surgical patients with obesity. METHODS: A systematic review and network meta-analysis was performed. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and EMBASE were searched. Only English-language RCTs investigating the use of nonopioid analgesics and adjuvants in adult surgical patients with obesity were included. The quality of evidence and certainty were assessed using the RoB 2 tool and GRADE framework, respectively. RESULTS: In total, 37 RCTs involving 3602 patients were included in the quantitative analysis. Compared with placebo/no intervention or a comparator, dexmedetomidine, ketamine, lidocaine, magnesium, and gabapentin significantly reduced postoperative opioid consumption after surgery. Ketamine/esketamine also significantly reduced POPCs. Ibuprofen, dexmedetomidine, and lidocaine significantly reduced postoperative nausea, whereas dexmedetomidine, either alone or combined with pregabalin, and lidocaine reduced postoperative vomiting.",research

Abstract: PURPOSE: Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) are common symptoms in pregnancy. Although no definitive treatment option for NVP, pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) supplementation has been used widely. The present study aims to systematically evaluate the current evidence regarding pyridoxine for the treatment of NVP. METHODS: Data were obtained using a stepwise search process using keywords in the following online medical databases; PubMed FINDINGS: Initial database searching indicated 548 potentially eligible articles, of which 18 studies satisfying the inclusion criteria were selected. Eight studies showed beneficial effects with pyridoxine alone as the supplementation, while six others found that the supplementation of pyridoxine in combination with another active substance had favourable effects. Supplementation of pyridoxine alone as well as combined treatment of pyridoxine with an active ingredient as the intervention significantly improved the symptoms of nausea according to Rhode's score [0.78 [95% CI: 0.26, 1.31; p = 0.003; I2 = 57%, p = 0.10)] and PUQE score [0.75 (95% CI: 0.28, 1.22; p = 0.002; I2 = 0%, p = 0.51)], respectively.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Several forms of cannabinoids are currently being used to manage nausea and vomiting (N/V). Emerging cases of refractory N/V associated with chronic cannabis use among adults and older patients have been reported named cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). CHS is a condition that leads to repeated and severe N/V in long-term users of cannabinoids. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to outline current treatments for the management of CHS. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. Databases were used to search for articles on CHS published from January 2009 to June 2021, yielding 225 results of which 17 were deemed relevant and underwent review by 2 separate reviewers. RESULTS: The duration of cannabis administration ranged between 6 months to 11 years may precipitate symptoms of CHS. The Rome IV diagnostic criteria of CHS require cannabinoid use and persistence of N/V symptoms for at least the past 6 months. Cannabis cessation is noted to be the most successful management, but other treatments also demonstrated symptom relief; these include hot water hydrotherapy, topical capsaicin cream, haloperidol, droperidol, benzodiazepines, propranolol, and aprepitant administration. CONCLUSION: More research on CHS is needed to enhance knowledge translation, education, and create awareness in the medical community on the side effects of cannabinoids and to propose the best treatment options.",research

Published: Aug 2017

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Chiari malformation type 1 (CM-1) is a variation of hindbrain development that can sometimes occur in asymptomatic individuals. Conventional treatment is surgical decompression, but little is known about the natural history of patients who do not undergo surgical management. This information is critical to determine how these patients should be managed. We conducted a systematic literature review to determine the natural history of CM-1, particularly in patients who did not undergo surgery and in asymptomatic individuals, to help patients and physicians determine when surgery is likely to be beneficial. METHODS: The literature search was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines using the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were predefined. RESULTS: In symptomatic patients who did not undergo surgery, headaches and nausea often improved, whereas ataxia and sensory disturbance tended not to improve spontaneously. Of patients, 27%-47% had an improvement in symptoms after 15 months, and 37%-40% with cough headache and 89% with nausea who were managed nonoperatively improved at follow-up. Most asymptomatic individuals with CM-1 remained asymptomatic (93.3%) even in the presence of syringomyelia. CONCLUSIONS: The natural history of mild symptomatic and asymptomatic CM-1 in adults is relatively benign and nonprogressive; the decision to perform surgical decompression should be based on severity and duration of a patient's symptoms at presentation. It is reasonable to observe a patient with mild or asymptomatic symptoms even in the presence of significant tonsillar descent or syringomyelia.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting increase the healthcare burden and lead to adverse clinical outcomes in cancer patients. Although many risk prediction models for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting have been developed, their methodological quality and applicability remain uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review and evaluate existing studies on risk prediction models for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in cancer patients. METHODS: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of science, CINAHL, Scopus, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), Wanfang Database, Chinese Biomedical literature Database (CBM) were systematically searched from inception to October 1, 2024. Studies were appraised critically and data extracted by two authors independently based on the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modeling Studies (CHARMS). RESULTS: A total of 4195 articles were retrieved, ultimately including 17 studies with 62 models for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The sample size of the included studies ranged from 137 to 2215, with areas under the curve ranging from 0.602 to 0.850. In this study, the deep forest model demonstrated strong discrimination and calibration, outperforming conventional machine learning and traditional regression models. The five most important predictors in the deep forest model were creatinine clearance, age, sex, anticipatory nausea and vomiting, and antiemetic regimen.",research

All studies were rated as high risk of bias mainly due to poor reporting of the participants and analysis domains, with high concerns regarding applicability in 9 studies. CONCLUSION: The research on prediction models for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting model is in its developing stage, with both commonalities and differences in predictors. Despite the overall acceptable performance of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting models, most studies have methodological shortcomings, and few models have been validated. Future studies should refer to the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) guideline for model design, implementation, and reporting. Moreover, studies with larger sample sizes and multicenter external validation are necessary to enhance the robustness of predictive models.

Abstract: AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe the main acupuncture techniques and parameters that have been used in the most varied symptoms of different types of cancer. BACKGROUND: Clinical evidence about the potential effectiveness of acupuncture and related therapies to control signs and symptoms associated with cancer or its treatment has been in several studies. Currently, there is already evidence of the use of acupuncture for the treatment of nausea and vomiting, fatigue, dry mouth, anxiety, depression, insomnia and pain. However, many studies lack firm rights or reproducible guidelines for treatment. DESIGN: This study performs a systematic review of clinical trials related to the topic, based on the PRISMA protocol. Thus, a search was carried out in the Scopus, Pubmed and Web of Science databases, covering studies since January 2007. METHODS: Structured and organised according to PICO standards, using keywords (""cancer"" OR ""malignant tumour"" OR ""chemotherapy"" OR ""radiotherapy"") AND (""acupuncture"" OR ""electroacupuncture"") AND (""pain"" OR ""nausea"" OR ""vomit"" OR ""fatigue"" OR ""xerostomia"" OR ""insomnia"" OR ""depression"" OR ""neuropathy""). RESULTS: After the selection and evaluation phase, 23 studies were included and analysed. CONCLUSION: Based on this analysis, it is concluded that acupuncture is safe and there is evidence of the reduction of gastrointestinal symptoms, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, pain, dry mouth, fatigue, insomnia, and improvement of cognitive capacity.

Studies evaluating pain management for emergency or unplanned operative deliveries or caesarean section performed under general anaesthesia were excluded. A total of 145 studies met the inclusion criteria. For patients undergoing elective caesarean section performed under neuraxial anaesthesia, recommendations include intrathecal morphine 50-100 µg or diamorphine 300 µg administered pre-operatively; paracetamol; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; and intravenous dexamethasone administered after delivery. If intrathecal opioid was not administered, single-injection local anaesthetic wound infiltration; continuous wound local anaesthetic infusion; and/or fascial plane blocks such as transversus abdominis plane or quadratus lumborum blocks are recommended.

Abstract: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery has become increasingly popular due to faster recovery times and reduced postoperative pain compared with thoracotomy. However, analgesic regimens for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery vary significantly. The goal of this systematic review was to evaluate the available literature and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. A systematic review was undertaken using procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) methodology. Randomised controlled trials published in the English language, between January 2010 and January 2021 assessing the effect of analgesic, anaesthetic or surgical interventions were identified. We retrieved 1070 studies of which 69 randomised controlled trials and two reviews met inclusion criteria. We recommend the administration of basic analgesia including paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or cyclo-oxygenase-2-specific inhibitors pre-operatively or intra-operatively and continued postoperatively. Intra-operative intravenous dexmedetomidine infusion may be used, specifically when basic analgesia and regional analgesic techniques could not be given. In addition, a paravertebral block or erector spinae plane block is recommended as a first-choice option. A serratus anterior plane block could also be administered as a second-choice option. Opioids should be reserved as rescue analgesics in the postoperative period.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Complex spinal procedures are associated with intense pain in the postoperative period. Adequate peri-operative pain management has been shown to correlate with improved outcomes including early ambulation and early discharge. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the available literature and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after complex spine surgery. DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES: A systematic review using the PROcedure SPECific postoperative pain managemenT methodology was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews published in the English language from January 2008 to April 2020 assessing postoperative pain after complex spine surgery using analgesic, anaesthetic or surgical interventions were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Databases. RESULTS: Out of 111 eligible studies identified, 31 randomised controlled trials and four systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Pre-operative and intra-operative interventions that improved postoperative pain were paracetamol, cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 specific-inhibitors or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intravenous ketamine infusion and regional analgesia techniques including epidural analgesia using local anaesthetics with or without opioids. Limited evidence was found for local wound infiltration, intrathecal and epidural opioids, erector spinae plane block, thoracolumbar interfascial plane block, intravenous lidocaine, dexmedetomidine and gabapentin. CONCLUSIONS: The analgesic regimen for complex spine surgery should include pre-operative or intra-operative paracetamol and COX-2 specific inhibitors or NSAIDs, continued postoperatively with opioids used as rescue analgesics.",research

Furthermore, the methadone studies did not use non-opioid analgesics, which should be the primary analgesics to ultimately reduce overall opioid requirements, including methadone. Further qualitative randomised controlled trials are required to confirm the efficacy and safety of these recommended analgesics on postoperative pain relief.",research

Abstract: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be associated with significant postoperative pain that is difficult to treat. We aimed to evaluate the available literature and develop updated recommendations for optimal pain management after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A systematic review was performed using the procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) methodology. Randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews published in the English language from August 2017 to December 2022 assessing postoperative pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy using analgesic, anaesthetic or surgical interventions were identified from MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Databases. From 589 full text articles, 157 randomised controlled trials and 31 systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Paracetamol combined with NSAIDs or cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors should be given either pre-operatively or intra-operatively, unless contraindicated. In addition, intra-operative intravenous (i.v.) dexamethasone, port-site wound infiltration or intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation are recommended, with opioids used for rescue analgesia. As a second-line regional technique, the erector spinae plane block or transversus abdominis plane block may be reserved for patients with a heightened risk of postoperative pain. Three-port laparoscopy, a low-pressure pneumoperitoneum, umbilical port extraction, active aspiration of the pneumoperitoneum and saline irrigation are recommended technical aspects of the operative procedure.",research

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) in managing different types of pain in different age groups and to provide evidence for the clinical application of new alternative strategy for pain management. METHODS: Electronic databases, including the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, and the Web of Science, were searched for studies published up to October 2020. Randomized controlled trials that reported on VR for pain management were included. RESULTS: A total of 31 randomized controlled trials were included. As for the pain intensity, the increase of visual analog scale score in the VR group was 1.62 scores less than that in the control group. In juvenile patients, the VR group had 1.79 scores lower than that in control group. For adult patients, the VR group had 1.34 scores lower than that in control group. As for other pain-related indicators, the VR group had lower levels of anxiety, lower pain unpleasantness, lower pulse rate, and shorter duration of dressing change and spent less time thinking about pain. Nevertheless, there was no statistical difference in pain tolerance. VR can effectively alleviate acute pain. In terms of chronic low back pain and cancer-related pain, there was no statistical difference between VR therapy and standard therapy. CONCLUSIONS: VR is a feasible alternative therapy for both juveniles and adults in pain management, and it has a greater potential for juveniles. VR can effectively alleviate acute pain. Nevertheless, VR showed little effectiveness in increasing pain tolerance, which may explain in part the ineffectiveness of VR therapy in pain management for chronic pain.",research

Abstract: Tonsillectomy is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures; however, pain management remains challenging. Procedure-specific efficacy as well as specific risks of treatment options should guide selection of pain management protocols based on evidence and should optimise analgesia without harm. The aims of this systematic review were to evaluate the available literature and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after tonsillectomy. A systematic review utilising preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines with procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) methodology was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials published in the English language up to November 2019 assessing postoperative pain using analgesic, anaesthetic or surgical interventions were identified. Out of the 719 potentially eligible studies identified, 226 randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, excluding the studies examining surgical techniques. Pre-operative and intra-operative interventions that improved postoperative pain were paracetamol; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; intravenous dexamethasone; ketamine (only assessed in children); gabapentinoids; dexmedetomidine; honey; and acupuncture. Inconsistent evidence was found for local anaesthetic infiltration; antibiotics; and magnesium sulphate. Limited evidence was found for clonidine. The analgesic regimen for tonsillectomy should include paracetamol; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; and intravenous dexamethasone, with opioids as rescue analgesics. Analgesic adjuncts such as intra-operative and postoperative acupuncture as well as postoperative honey are also recommended.",research

Abstract: Background: Pain management is an important priority in the treatment of acute pancreatitis (AP). Current evidence and guideline recommendations are inconsistent on the most effective analgesic protocol. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of analgesics for pain relief in AP. Methods: A literature search was performed to identify all RCTs assessing analgesics in patients with AP. The primary outcome was the number of participants who needed rescue analgesia. Study quality was assessed using Jadad score. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) or weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were analysed using a random-effects model. Results: Twelve studies comprising 699 patients with AP (83% mild AP) were analysed. The tested analgesics significantly decreased the need for rescue analgesia (3 studies, OR.36, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.60) vs. placebo or conventional treatment. The analgesics also improved the pain score [Visual Analogue Scale (Δ-VAS)] at 24 h (WMD 18.46, 0.84 to 36.07) and by the 3rd to 7th days (WMD 11.57, 0.87 to 22.28). Opioids vs. non-opioids were associated with a decrease in the need for rescue analgesia (6 studies, OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.86, p = 0.03) but without significance in pain score. In subgroup analyses, opioids were similar to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) regarding the primary outcome (4 studies, OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.32, p = 0.18). There were no significant differences in other clinical outcomes and rate of adverse events. Other studies, comparing epidural anaesthesia vs. patient-controlled analgesia and opioid (buprenorphine) vs. opioid (pethidine) did not show significant difference in primary outcome.",research

Abstract: Background: Primary dysmenorrhea is a common gynecological disorder that affects many women of reproductive age. Ginger, a widely used spice with anti-inflammatory properties, has been suggested as a potential treatment for the painful cramps associated with this condition. Objective: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of ginger for pain management in primary dysmenorrhea. Methods: Our systematic review was registered in Prospero (CRD42023418001). Six English (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL complete, and Cochrane) and one Persian electric database (SID) was searched up to May 2023 for English or Persian studies that measure the effect of ginger on pain in dysmenorrhea. The Cochrane tool was used to assess the risk of bias of the included studies. Random effects meta-analyses were performed to obtain standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Out of the 804 articles initially identified from the search, 24 were included for qualitative analysis and 12 for quantitative analysis after a full-text evaluation. The combined results of the studies indicate that ginger is notably more effective than placebo in reducing both the intensity (SMD = -1.13; 95% CI = -1.59 to -0.68, I2 = 81.05%) and duration of pain (SMD = -0.29; 95% CI = -0.46 to -0.12). There were no differences between ginger and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (SMD = 0.01; 95% CI = -0.24 to 0.25), or exercise (SMD = 0.06; 95% CI = -0.66 to 0.78) for pain intensity.

Abstract: Analgesic protocols used to treat pain after breast surgery vary significantly. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available literature on this topic and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after oncological breast surgery. A systematic review using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidance with procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) methodology was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials assessing postoperative pain using analgesic, anaesthetic or surgical interventions were identified. Seven hundred and forty-nine studies were found, of which 53 randomised controlled trials and nine meta-analyses met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Quantitative analysis suggests that dexamethasone and gabapentin reduced postoperative pain. The use of paravertebral blocks also reduced postoperative pain scores, analgesia consumption and the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Intra-operative opioid requirements were documented to be lower when a pectoral nerves block was performed, which also reduced postoperative pain scores and opioid consumption. We recommend basic analgesics (i.e. paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) administered pre-operatively or intra-operatively and continued postoperatively. In addition, pre-operative gabapentin and dexamethasone are also recommended. In major breast surgery, a regional anaesthetic technique such as paravertebral block or pectoral nerves block and/or local anaesthetic wound infiltration may be considered for additional pain relief. Paravertebral block may be continued postoperatively using catheter techniques.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Gate control theory and fear-avoidance model of chronic pain posit that biopsychosocial factors can modulate pain. Nonpharmacological interventions are recommended in managing chronic pain, but little information is available regarding their efficacy in older adults. We examined and compared the efficacy of different nonpharmacological intervention approaches for chronic pain management among older adults via meta-analysis and subgroup analysis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (PROSPERO number CRD42020222767), a systematic search was undertaken using MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO up to March 21, 2022. Randomized controlled trials were included, and data were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis model. Risk of bias was assessed using a quality rating scale for psychological interventions. RESULTS: Twenty-five trials (N = 2,394 participants) were identified. Six types of nonpharmacological interventions were compared with control conditions (sham/attention control and treatment as usual). Nonpharmacological interventions were associated with significant reductions in pain intensity, pain interference, depressive symptoms, catastrophizing beliefs, and improvement in physical performance (standardized mean differences -0.34 to 0.54). Subgroup analyses based on different nonpharmacological approaches revealed the benefits of psychological approaches combined with physical activity. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Nonpharmacological interventions, particularly those adopting psychological approaches and physical activity, have a small but statistically significant effect on chronic pain management in older adults.",research

Authors: Lauren A Spreen, Emma N Dittmar, Kyle C Quirk et al. Published: May 2022

Abstract: Buprenorphine possesses many unique attributes that make it a practical agent for adults and adolescents with opioid use disorder (OUD) and/or acute or chronic pain. Sublingual buprenorphine has been the standard of care for treating OUD, but its use in pain management is not as clearly defined. Current practice guidelines recommend a period of mild-to-moderate withdrawal from opioids before transitioning to buprenorphine due to its ability to displace full agonists from the μ-opioid receptor. However, this strategy can lead to negative physical and psychological outcomes for patients. Novel initiation strategies suggest that concomitant administration of small doses of buprenorphine with opioids can avoid the unwanted withdrawal associated with buprenorphine initiation. We aim to systematically review the buprenorphine initiation strategies that have emerged in the last decade. Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Databases were searched for relevant literature. Studies were included if they were published in the English language and described the transition to buprenorphine from opioids. Data were collected from each study and synthesized using descriptive statistics. This review included 7 observational studies, 1 feasibility study, and 39 case reports/series which included 924 patients. The strategies utilized between the literature included traditional initiation (47.9%), microdosing with various buprenorphine formulations (16%), and miscellaneous methods (36.1%). Traditional initiation and microdosing initiation were compared in the data synthesis and analysis; miscellaneous methods were omitted given the high variability between methods.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pain is one of the most common and problematic symptoms encountered by patients with cancer. Due to the multifactorial aetiology, pain management of these patients frequently requires multidisciplinary interventions including conventional support and specialty palliative care. Acupuncture has been identified as a possible adjunctive therapy for symptom management in cancer pain, and there is currently no systematic review focused solely on the evidence of acupuncture on cancer pain in palliative care. OBJECTIVE: To critically analyse currently available publications regarding the use of acupuncture for pain management among patients with cancer in palliative care settings. METHODS: Multiple academic databases were searched from inception to 29 October 2020. Randomised controlled trials involving acupuncture in palliative care for treatment of cancer-related pain were synthesised. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers, and methodological quality of each included study was assessed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) 2011 Levels of Evidence. RESULTS: Five studies (n=189) were included in this systematic review. Results indicated a favourable effect of acupuncture on pain relief in palliative care for patients with cancer. According to OCEBM 2011 Levels of Evidence, they were level 2 in one case (20%), level 3 in two cases (40%) and level 4 in the remaining (40%). Low-level evidence adversely affects the reliability of findings. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture may be an effective and safe treatment associated with pain reduction in the palliative care of patients with cancer. Further high-quality, adequately powered studies are needed in the future.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND/IMPORTANCE: Opioids continue to play a key role in managing acute postoperative pain, but their use contributes to adverse outcomes. Buprenorphine may offer effective analgesia with a superior safety profile. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of buprenorphine with other opioids for acute postoperative pain management in adults. EVIDENCE REVIEW: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science were searched from inception to February 2024. Randomized controlled trials comparing buprenorphine with other opioids for acute postoperative pain management in adults were included. Of 2421 records identified, 58 studies met inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed using Stata/BE V.18. The primary outcome was pain intensity. Secondary outcomes included rescue analgesia use, duration of analgesia, and adverse effects. FINDINGS: Analysis of 41 comparisons (2587 participants) showed buprenorphine significantly reduced pain intensity compared with all other opioids (Hedges's g=-0.36, 95% CI=-0.59 to -0.14, p<0.001, 95% prediction interval (PI)=-1.70 to 0.97).

Abstract: AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To compare and rank the efficacy and safety of non-pharmacological interventions in the management of labour pain. BACKGROUND: Recently, various non-pharmacological interventions have been applied to manage labour pain and have shown positive effects. However, evidence identifying which type of non-pharmacological intervention is more efficient and safer is limited. DESIGN: Systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis based on PRISMA-NMA. METHODS: Seven databases were searched from database inception-March 2020. Two reviewers independently performed study selection, quality appraisal and data extraction. Conventional meta-analysis was conducted using either fixed-effects model or random-effects model according to statistical heterogeneity. The Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted using the consistency model. RESULTS: 43 studies involving nine non-pharmacological interventions were included. The Bayesian network meta-analysis showed that acupressure (SMD = -2.00, 95% CrI -3.09 to -0.94), aromatherapy (SMD = -2.01, 95% CrI -3.70 to -0.35) and massage therapy (SMD = -1.26, 95% CrI -2.26 to -0.30) had significant positive effects on alleviating labour pain, with aromatherapy being the most effective.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Unmanaged pain significantly affects cancer survivors' quality of life. Nurses should play a significant role in pain management through non-pharmacological interventions. This review aims to explore the efficacy and safety of breathing exercises for pain management in all cancer survivors. DESIGN: A systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Thirteen databases, including PubMed, EMBase, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, JBI, Science Direct, Scopus, SocINDEX, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CNKI, and Wan Fang, were searched from inception to May, 2021. REVIEW/ANALYSIS METHODS: Studies that focused on the efficacy of breathing exercises for pain management, regardless of the age of the cancer survivors, were included. Cochrane tools were used for the quality appraisal of the included studies. Because of the limited number of studies, descriptive data analysis was used to summarize the results. RESULTS: Ten studies were included. Slow pursed lip breathing showed benefits for post-surgical pain. Contradictory findings were identified in the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery for post-surgical pain. Slow deep breathing and Hey-Hu regular breathing techniques were effective for pain management in pediatric cancer patients. The Active Cycle of Breathing Technique and five-minute mindful breathing did not have any statistically significant effects on pain relief. Quality of life was measured in three studies, with some improvement. Only one study addressed adverse events and reported that no adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Breathing exercises may be a promising approach to pain relief in cancer survivors. However, more rigorously designed studies are required to establish the evidence.",research

Published: Dec 2022

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Symptomatic cholelithiasis is a common surgical disease and accounts for half of the over one million cholecystectomies performed in the USA annually. Despite its prevalence, only one prior systematic review has examined the evidence around treatment strategies and it contained a narrow scope. The goal of this systematic review was to analyze the clinical effectiveness of treatment options for symptomatic cholelithiasis, including surgery, non-surgical therapies, and ED pain management strategies. METHODS: Literature search was performed from January 2000 through June 2020, and a narrative analysis was performed as studies were heterogeneous. RESULTS: We identified 12 publications reporting on 10 trials (9 randomized controlled trials and 1 observational study) comparing treatment methods. The studies assessed surgery, observation, lithotripsy, ursodeoxycholic acid, electro-acupuncture, and pain-management strategies in the emergency department. Only one compared surgery to observation. CONCLUSION: This work presents the existing data and underscores the current gap in knowledge regarding treatment for patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis. We use these results to suggest how future trials may guide comparisons between the timing of surgery and watchful waiting to create a set of standardized guidelines. Providing appropriate and timely treatment for symptomatic cholelithiasis is important to streamline care for a costly and prevalent disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Guidance on acute pain management among people with opioid use disorder (OUD) is limited. PURPOSE: To synthesize evidence on the benefits and harms of acute pain interventions among people with OUD. DATA SOURCES: APA PsycArticles, APA PsycInfo, APA PsycExtra, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and the Web of Science Core Collection through 7 July 2024.

DATA EXTRACTION: Independent dual screening, single-investigator data extraction with verification, and dual quality and strength of evidence assessment. DATA SYNTHESIS: Seventeen trials, 20 controlled observational studies, and 78 uncontrolled observational studies met eligibility criteria. Continuing use of buprenorphine during acute pain episodes may be associated with similar or improved pain-related outcomes versus discontinuing, based on cohort studies conducted primarily in perioperative settings. Single well-conducted randomized controlled trials in emergency department (ED) or perioperative settings in adults not prescribed medications for OUD suggest oral clonidine, intramuscular haloperidol and midazolam with intravenous (IV) morphine, and intraoperative IV lidocaine may improve pain outcomes and warrant study in diverse patient populations. Few studies evaluated methadone or the effect of interventions on OUD outcomes. LIMITATIONS: Most evidence is observational and at risk of bias due to confounding.

Authors: Lori Kennedy Madden, Michelle Hill, Teresa L May et al. Published: Dec 2017

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Targeted temperature management (TTM) is often used in neurocritical care to minimize secondary neurologic injury and improve outcomes. TTM encompasses therapeutic hypothermia, controlled normothermia, and treatment of fever. TTM is best supported by evidence from neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, although it has also been explored in ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, and intracranial hemorrhage patients. Critical care clinicians using TTM must select appropriate cooling techniques, provide a reasonable rate of cooling, manage shivering, and ensure adequate patient monitoring among other challenges. METHODS: The Neurocritical Care Society recruited experts in neurocritical care, nursing, and pharmacotherapy to form a writing Committee in 2015. The group generated a set of 16 clinical questions relevant to TTM using the PICO format. With the assistance of a research librarian, the Committee undertook a comprehensive literature search with no back date through November 2016 with additional references up to March 2017. RESULTS: The Committee utilized GRADE methodology to adjudicate the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low based on their confidence that the estimate of effect approximated the true effect. They generated recommendations regarding the implementation of TTM based on this systematic review only after considering the quality of evidence, relative risks and benefits, patient values and preferences, and resource allocation. CONCLUSION: This guideline is intended for neurocritical care clinicians who have chosen to use TTM in patient care; it is not meant to provide guidance regarding the clinical indications for TTM itself.",research

Authors: Ebrahim Abbasi
Published: Jan 2025

Abstract: Dengue fever, caused by the dengue virus (DENV) and transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitos, remains a global health concern with no definitive treatment. Given the challenges in vaccine development and disease management, micronutrients such as vitamin D have emerged as potential adjunctive therapies because of their immunomodulatory properties. The effectiveness of vitamin D in the prevention and control of dengue fever was assessed in this systematic review by evaluating vitamin D's impact on immune responses, viral replication, and clinical outcomes. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, relevant studies were retrieved from the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies examining the association between vitamin D and DENV infection, disease severity, and immune modulation. Six studies met the inclusion criteria. Findings indicated that vitamin D supplementation reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, enhanced macrophage responses, and modulated toll-like receptor activity. Higher vitamin D levels were associated with lower viral replication and milder clinical manifestations of dengue fever. Vitamin D demonstrates potential as an adjunctive therapy for dengue fever by modulating immune responses and reducing disease severity. More clinical trials are required to validate its therapeutic efficacy and determine optimal supplementation strategies.

Published: Oct 2020

Abstract: Migraine and sleep disorders are common and often burdensome chronic conditions with a high prevalence in the general population, and with considerable socio-economic impact and costs.The existence of a relationship between migraine and sleep disorders has been recognized from centuries by clinicians and epidemiological studies. Nevertheless, the exact nature of this association, the underlying mechanisms and interactions are complex and not completely understood. Recent biochemical and functional imaging studies identified central nervous system structures and neurotransmitters involved in the pathophysiology of migraine and also important for the regulation of normal sleep architecture, suggesting a possible causative role, in the pathogenesis of both disorders, of a dysregulation in these common nervous system pathways.This systematic review summarizes the existing data on migraine and sleep disorders with the aim to evaluate the existence of a causal relationship and to assess the presence of influencing factors. The identification of specific sleep disorders associated with migraine should induce clinicians to systematically assess their presence in migraine patients and to adopt combined treatment strategies.",research

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: While there are several trials that support the efficacy of various drugs for migraine prophylaxis against placebo, there is limited evidence addressing the comparative safety and efficacy of these drugs. We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to facilitate comparison between drugs for migraine prophylaxis. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and clinicaltrials.gov from inception to August 13, 2022, for randomized trials of pharmacological treatments for migraine prophylaxis in adults. Reviewers worked independently and in duplicate to screen references, extract data, and assess risk of bias. We performed a frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis and rated the certainty (quality) of evidence as either high, moderate, low, or very low using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: We identified 74 eligible trials, reporting on 32,990 patients. We found high certainty evidence that monoclonal antibodies acting on the calcitonin gene related peptide or its receptor (CGRP(r)mAbs), gepants, and topiramate increase the proportion of patients who experience a 50% or more reduction in monthly migraine days, compared to placebo. We found moderate certainty evidence that beta-blockers, valproate, and amitriptyline increase the proportion of patients who experience a 50% or more reduction in monthly migraine days, and low certainty evidence that gabapentin may not be different from placebo.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study reviewed migraine prevalence and disability gathered through epidemiologic survey studies in the United States conducted over the past three decades. We summarized these studies and evaluated changing patterns of disease prevalence and disability. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of US studies addressing the prevalence, disability, and/or burden of migraine, including both episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM). A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol was used in conjunction with the PubMed search engine. Eligible studies were published before February 2022, were conducted in the United States, included representative samples, and used a case definition of migraine based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD). The primary measure of disease burden was the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS). The MIDAS measures days lost due to migraine over 3 months in three domains and defines groups with moderate (Grade III) or severe disability (Grade IV) using cut-scores. RESULTS: Of the 1609 identified records, 26 publications from 11 US population-based studies met eligibility criteria. The prevalence of migraine in the population has remained relatively consistent for the past 30 years: ranging from 11.7% to 14.7% overall, 17.1% to 19.2% in women, and 5.6% to 7.2% in men in the studies reviewed. CM prevalence is 0.91% (1.3% among women and 0.5% of men) in adults and 0.8% in adolescents. The proportion of people with migraine and moderate-to-severe MIDAS disability (Grades III-IV), has trended upward across studies from 22.0% in 2005 to 39.0% in 2012, to 43.2% in 2016, and 42.4% in 2018.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Migraine is a disabling primary headache disorder often associated with triggers. Diet-related triggers are a common cause of migraine and certain diets have been reported to decrease the frequency of migraine attacks if dietary triggers or patterns are adjusted. OBJECTIVE: The systematic literature review was conducted to qualitatively summarize evidence from the published literature regarding the role of diet patterns, diet-related triggers, and diet interventions in people with migraine. METHODS: A literature search was carried out on diet patterns, diet-related triggers, and diet interventions used to treat and/or prevent migraine attacks, using an a priori protocol. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched to identify studies assessing the effect of diet, food, and nutrition in people with migraine aged ≥18 years. Only primary literature sources (randomized controlled trials or observational studies) were included and searches were conducted from January 2000 to March 2019. The NICE checklist was used to assess the quality of the included studies of randomized controlled trials and the Downs and Black checklist was used for the assessment of observational studies. RESULTS: A total of 43 studies were included in this review, of which 11 assessed diet patterns, 12 assessed diet interventions, and 20 assessed diet-related triggers. The overall quality of evidence was low, as most of the (68%) studies assessing diet patterns and diet-related triggers were cross-sectional studies or patient surveys.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although triptans are widely used in the acute management of migraine, there is uncertainty around the comparative efficacy of triptans among each other and vs non-triptan migraine treatments. We conducted systematic reviews and network meta-analyses to compare the relative efficacy of triptans (alone or in combination with other drugs) for acute treatment of migraines compared with other triptan agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), acetaminophen, ergots, opioids, or anti-emetics. METHODS: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched for randomized controlled trials that compared triptans (alone or in combination with other drugs) with placebo-controlled or active migraine treatments. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were completed independently by multiple reviewers. Outcome data were combined and analyzed using a Bayesian network meta-analysis. For each outcome, odds ratios, relative risks, and absolute probability of response were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 133 randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Standard dose triptans relieved headaches within 2 hours in 42 to 76% of patients, and 2-hour sustained freedom from pain was achieved for 18 to 50% of patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Direct comparisons of the tolerability and safety of migraine preventive treatments targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide pathway are lacking. This study aimed to compare the safety and tolerability of anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies and gepants in migraine prevention. METHODS: A network meta-analysis of phase 3 randomized controlled trials assessing the safety and tolerability of anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibodies (erenumab, eptinezumab, fremanezumab, or galcanezumab) and gepants (atogepant, rimegepant) in migraine prevention was performed. Primary outcomes were treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included any adverse events, adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation and individual adverse events. RESULTS: We included 19 randomized controlled trials, comprising 14,584 patients. Atogepant 120 mg (OR 2.22, 95% CI [1.26, 3.91]) and galcanezumab 240 mg (OR 1.63, 95% CI [1.33, 2.00]) showed the largest odds of treatment-emergent adverse events compared to placebo. While eptinezumab 30 mg had greater odds of adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (OR 2.62, 95% CI [1.03,6.66]). No significant differences in serious adverse events were found between active treatments and placebo.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Migraine is one of the most common types of headache, and it is the second most common cause of neurological disorders, with an annual prevalence of about 15% of the population. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of BoNT-A on the duration and intensity of migraine attacks. In addition, we investigated the effective injection sites. METHODS: According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched online databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, ProQuest, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar from 2011 to 2021. RESULTS: A total of 24 articles were included in the study. The use of BoNT-A in individuals suffering from chronic migraine (CM) decreases the frequency of migraine attacks per month, pain intensity, medication use, emergency visits, and migraine-related disabilities. The BoNT-A was well tolerated and leads to improved performance and better quality of life (QoL). Overall, treatment with BoNT-A in adults with CM is beneficial. In addition, the use of BoNT-A in individuals with vestibular migraine (VM) reduces the frequency of migraines and brings about the improvement of disability status caused by migraine headaches. Meanwhile, the use of BoNT-A reduces the frequency of migraine attacks per month among individuals with chronic refractory migraine (CRM). CONCLUSIONS: The use of BoNT-A is a low-cost option for the treatment of various kinds of migraines, including chronic, episodic, unilateral, and vestibular types. BoNT-A can reduce the frequency of migraine attacks per month and diminish the severity of pain.",research

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to evaluate the evidence regarding spinal manipulation as an alternative or integrative therapy in reducing migraine pain and disability. METHODS: PubMed and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for clinical trials that evaluated spinal manipulation and migraine-related outcomes through April 2017. Search terms included: migraine, spinal manipulation, manual therapy, chiropractic, and osteopathic. Meta-analytic methods were employed to estimate the effect sizes (Hedges' g) and heterogeneity (I RESULTS: Our search identified 6 RCTs (pooled n = 677; range of n = 42-218) eligible for meta-analysis. Intervention duration ranged from 2 to 6 months; outcomes included measures of migraine days (primary outcome), migraine pain/intensity, and migraine disability. Methodological quality varied across the studies. For example, some studies received high or unclear bias scores for methodological features such as compliance, blinding, and completeness of outcome data. Due to high levels of heterogeneity when all 6 studies were included in the meta-analysis, the 1 RCT performed only among chronic migraineurs was excluded. Heterogeneity across the remaining studies was low. We observed that spinal manipulation reduced migraine days with an overall small effect size (Hedges' g = -0.35, 95% CI: -0.53, -0.16, P < .001) as well as migraine pain/intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal manipulation may be an effective therapeutic technique to reduce migraine days and pain/intensity.",research

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To compare various exercise modalities' efficacy on migraine frequency, intensity, duration, and disability. BACKGROUND: Exercise has been shown to be an effective intervention to reduce migraine symptoms and disability; however, no clear evidence exists regarding the most effective exercise modalities for migraine treatment. METHODS: A systematic review was performed in PubMed, PEDro, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Clinical trials that analyzed the efficacy of various exercise modalities in addressing the frequency, intensity, duration, and disability of patients with migraine were included. Eight network meta-analyses based on frequentist (F) and Bayesian (B) models were developed to estimate the direct and indirect evidence of various exercise modalities. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence (CI) and credible intervals (CrI) were calculated for each treatment effect based on Hedge's g and p scores to rank the modalities. RESULTS: We included 28 studies with 1501 migraine participants. Yoga (F: SMD -1.30; 95% CI -2.09, -0.51; B: SMD -1.33; 95% CrI -2.21, -0.45), high-intensity aerobic exercise (F: SMD -1.30; 95% CI -2.21, -0.39; B: SMD -1.17; 95% CrI -2.20, -0.20) and moderate-intensity continuous aerobic exercise (F: SMD -1.01; 95% CI -1.63, -0.39; B: SMD -1.06; 95% CrI -1.74, -0.38) were significantly superior to pharmacological treatment alone for decreasing migraine frequency based on both models. Only yoga (F: SMD -1.40; 95% CI -2.41, -0.39; B: SMD -1.41; 95% CrI -2.54, -0.27) was significantly superior to pharmacological treatment alone for reducing migraine intensity.",research

Authors: Jonathan R Treadwell, Amy Y Tsou, Benjamin Rouse et al. Published: Apr 2025

Abstract: OBJECTIVES/BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to synthesize evidence on the benefits and harms of behavioral interventions for migraine prevention in children and adults. The efficacy and safety of behavioral interventions for migraine prevention have not been tested in recent systematic reviews. METHODS: An expert panel including clinical psychologists, neurologists, primary care physicians, researchers, funders, individuals with migraine, and their caregivers informed the scope and methods. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, clinicaltrials.gov, and gray literature for English-language randomized trials (January 1, 1975 to August 24, 2023) of behavioral interventions for preventing migraine attacks. Primary outcomes were migraine/headache frequency, migraine disability, and migraine-related quality of life. One reviewer extracted data and rated the risk of bias, and a second verified data for completeness and accuracy. Data were synthesized with meta-analysis when deemed appropriate, and we rated the strength of evidence (SOE) using established methods. RESULTS: For adults, we included 50 trials (77 publications, N = 6024 adults). Most interventions were multicomponent (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT], biofeedback, relaxation training, mindfulness-based therapies, and/or education). Most trials were at high risk of bias, primarily due to possible measurement bias and incomplete data. For adults, we found that any of three components (CBT, relaxation training, mindfulness-based therapies) may reduce migraine/headache attack frequency (SOE: low). Education alone that targets behavior may improve migraine-related disability (SOE: low).",research

We also found that mindfulness-based therapies may reduce migraine disability more than education, and relaxation + education may improve migraine-related quality of life more than propranolol (SOE: low). For children/adolescents, we included 13 trials (16 publications, N = 1444 children), but the evidence was only sufficient to conclude that CBT + biofeedback + relaxation training may reduce migraine attack frequency and disability more than education alone (SOE: low). CONCLUSION: Results suggest that for adults, CBT, relaxation training, and mindfulness-based therapies may each reduce the frequency of migraine/headache attacks, and education alone may reduce disability. For children/adolescents, CBT + biofeedback + relaxation training may reduce migraine attack frequency and disability more than education alone. Evidence consisted primarily of underpowered trials of multicomponent interventions compared with various types of control groups. Limitations include semantic inconsistencies in the literature since 1975, differential usage of treatment components, expectation effects for subjectively reported outcomes, incomplete data, and unclear dosing effects. Future research should enroll children and adolescents, standardize intervention components when possible to improve reproducibility, consider smart study designs and personalized therapies based on individual characteristics, use comparison groups that control for expectation, which is a known challenge in behavioral trials, enroll and retain larger samples, study emerging digital and telehealth modes of care delivery, improve the completeness of data collection, and establish or update clinical trial conduct and reporting guidelines that are appropriate for the conduct of studies of behavioral therapies.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Chronic migraine can be a profoundly disabling disorder that may be treated with preventive medications. However, uncertainty remains as to which preventive medication is the most effective. We present a network meta-analysis to determine the effectiveness and rank of preventive drugs for chronic migraine in adults. METHODS: We identified, reviewed, and extracted data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of preventive drugs for chronic migraine with at least 200 participants. Data were analysed using network meta-analysis. FINDINGS: We included 12 RCTs of six medications (Eptinezumab, Erenumab, Fremanezumab, Galcanezumab, Onabotulinumtoxin A, and Topiramate) compared to placebo or each other. All drugs effectively reduced monthly headache and migraine days compared with placebo. The most effective drug for monthly headache days was Eptinezumab 300mg, with a mean difference of -2.46 days, 95% Credible Interval (CrI): -3.23 to -1.69. On the Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Area (SUCRA) analysis, the probability that Eptinezumab 300mg was ranked highest was 0.82. For monthly migraine days, the most effective medication was Fremanezumab-monthly, with a mean difference: -2.77 days, 95% CrI: -3.36 to -2.17, and 0.98 probability of being ranked the highest. All included drugs, except Topiramate, improved headache-related quality of life. No eligible studies were identified for the other common preventive oral medications such as Amitriptyline, Candesartan, and Propranolol. The main reasons were that the studies did not define chronic migraine, were undertaken before the definition of chronic migraine, or were too small.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Multiple clinical trials with different exercise protocols have demonstrated efficacy in the management of migraine. However, there is no head-to-head comparison of efficacy between the different exercise interventions. METHODS: A systematic review and network meta-analysis was performed involving all clinical trials which determined the efficacy of exercise interventions in reducing the frequency of monthly migraine. Medical journal search engines included Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus spanning all previous years up to July 30, 2022. Both aerobic and strength/resistance training protocols were included. The mean difference (MD, 95% confidence interval) in monthly migraine frequency from baseline to end-of-intervention between the active and control arms was used as an outcome measure. Efficacy evidence from direct and indirect comparisons was combined by conducting a random effects model network meta-analysis. The efficacy of the three exercise protocols was compared, i.e., moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, high-intensity aerobic exercise, and strength/resistance training. Studies that compared the efficacy of migraine medications (topiramate, amitriptyline) to exercise were included. Additionally, the risk of bias in all included studies was assessed by using the Cochrane Risk of Bias version 2 (RoB2). RESULTS: There were 21 published clinical trials that involved a total of 1195 migraine patients with a mean age of 35 years and a female-to-male ratio of 6.7. There were 27 pairwise comparisons and 8 indirect comparisons.",research

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP) are one of the most common complains of the early pregnancy period and are bothersome for pregnant women. Some prefer to use herbal medicine instead of chemical agents. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of ginger, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), and placebo for the treatment of NVP. METHOD: The study was performed as a triple blind clinical trial on pregnant women suffering mild to moderate NVP between 6 and 16 weeks of pregnancy. In these women ginger, 500 mg twice daily, vitamin B6 40 mg twice daily and placebo twice daily were administered for 4 d. Rhodes questionnaire was used for evaluation of the severity of symptoms. The severity of NVP was evaluated 24 h before entering the study and up to 4 d after using medications and results were compared among the three groups. RESULTS: Seventy-seven women finished the study (28 in the Ginger group, 26 in the B6 group, and 23 in the placebo group). The women of the three groups did not have significant differences according to age, gestational age, parity, and severity of each symptom before treatment and educational status. Total score of Rhodes questionnaire for nausea was decreased significantly in three groups after treatment. (p < .001, p = .012, and p = .03 for ginger, vitamin B6, and placebo, respectively.) Also total score of Rhodes questionnaire for vomiting was decreased in three groups (p = .03 for ginger, p = .02 for B6, and p = .04 for placebo).",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a non-infectious immune disease and incidents of the disease has continuously increased in Thailand. Ginger, a Thai herb, is used in food and Thai traditional medicine. This study was designed to assess efficacy and safety of ginger extract in comparison with loratadine for AR treatment. METHODS: AR patients were treated with ginger extract 500 mg (n = 40) against those treated with loratadine 10 mg (n = 40) in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial for 3 and 6 weeks. The efficacy was evaluated from clinical examinations i.e. total nasal symptom scores (TNSS), cross-sectional area of the nasal cavity with acoustic rhinometry (ARM) and rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (RQLQ). The safety of treatment was measured by blood pressure, blood analysis and history-taking for side effects. RESULTS: The results showed both ginger extract and loratadine treated groups significantly decreased TNSS scores but there was no significant difference between the two groups. In acoustic rhinometry measurement, the ginger treated group significantly gradually increased the estimated volume of the nasal cavity and decreased distances from the nostril, but the loratadine treated group did not cause a change. Both groups gave significantly improvement in every aspect of the RQLQ at third weeks. The treatment with ginger extract was as safe as loratadine as shown by renal and liver function results obtained from blood analysis. Both treatments had no effect on blood pressure of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The ginger extract is as good as loratadine in improving nasal symptoms and quality of life in AR patients.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is substantial interest in the role of ginger as an adjuvant therapy for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). However, available evidence lacks robust methodology. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of adjuvant ginger compared with placebo on chemotherapy-induced nausea-related quality of life (QoL) and CINV-related outcomes. DESIGN: A parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial with 1:1 allocation was conducted. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: One hundred three chemotherapy-naïve adults scheduled to receive moderately to highly emetogenic chemotherapy at two hospitals in Australia were enrolled and analyzed. INTERVENTION: Four standardized ginger capsules (totaling 84 mg/day active gingerols/shogaols), or placebo, were administered commencing the day of chemotherapy and continuing for 5 days for chemotherapy cycles 1 through 3. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was chemotherapy-induced nausea-related QoL. Secondary outcomes were vomiting- and CINV-related QoL; anticipatory, acute, and delayed nausea and vomiting; fatigue; nutritional status; depression and anxiety; health-related QoL; and adverse events. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Mixed analysis of variance with repeated measures determined differences between groups. The null hypothesis was no difference between groups. After applying a Bonferroni multiple testing correction, evidence against the null hypothesis was considered at P= 0.003.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Uterine cervix tumors have an invasive nature, with the capacity to proliferate to surrounding organs such as the vagina, bladder, and rectum, as well as the capacity for dissemination and involvement of structures distant from its place of origin. According to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, patients with stages IB I, IB I microscopic (small dimension <4 cm) are indicated for radiotherapy or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin (40 mg/m2). However, cisplatin has side effects such as hematological implications (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia), gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation), and fatigue. Zingiber officinale contains bioactive compounds that act on pregnancy and postoperative nausea, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and also in the management of fatigue, myalgia, and insomnia. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of ginger on chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with cervical cancer undergoing treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy. METHODS AND ANALYSES: A randomized intervention clinical and controlled trial with a triple-blind design is described, comparing the effects of institutional antiemetic therapy alone, as well as in combination with 2 different ginger concentrations. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Due to the nature of the study, we obtained approval from the Division Ethics Committee of Liga Contra o Câncer.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate ginger's cardiovascular and metabolic effects (Zingiberofficinale) add-on therapy in type 2 diabetes patients over six weeks. METHODS: We performed a single-arm clinical trial. In well-to-moderately controlled Type 2 diabetic patients with unchanged treatment for at least three months, the intervention consisted of 6-week add-on oral supplementation of powdered ginger extracts in capsules at a dose of 399 mg three times per day. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), glycatedhaemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profile, kidney and liver function analysis were performed at initial and final visits, with a follow-up visit on day 21. Adherence to treatment, palatability and safety were also assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 21 participants (16 females) were included in the analysis. We found a non-significant decrease of E' wave from 0.05[0.04-0.09] to 0.06[0.05-0.7]cm/s, A-wave from 0.8[0.6-0.8] to 0.7[0.6-0.8] cm/s, and E-wave from 0.6[0.5-0.7] to 0.5[0.425-0.6]cm/s. There was a significant reduction of HbA1c from 49.7[47.0-57.4] to 44.3[38.8-53.0] mmol/mol and triglycerides from 1.6[1.4-1.9] to 1.2[0.9-1.8] mmol/l. A 5% decrease or more was observed for diurnal DBP, diurnal MAP and 24-hour DBP.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of a standardized ginger (Zingiber officinale) root powder, compared to placebo, on gastrointestinal bacteria and associated outcomes in healthy adults. METHODS: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial allocated participants aged 18 to 30 y to ginger or microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) placebo. The intervention comprised 1.2 g/d of ginger (4 capsules per day totaling 84 mg/d of active gingerols/shogaols) for 14 d following a 1-wk run-in period. Primary outcomes were gastrointestinal community composition, alpha and beta diversity, and differential abundance, measured using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples. Secondary outcomes were gastrointestinal symptoms, bowel function, depression, anxiety, stress, fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events. RESULTS: Fifty-one participants were enrolled and analyzed (71% female; mean age 25 ± 3 y; ginger: n = 29, placebo: n = 22). There was a greater increase in relative abundance of phylum, Actinobacteria, observed following ginger supplementation compared to placebo (U: 145.0; z: -2.1; P = 0.033). Ginger was associated with a greater abundance of the genera Parabacteroides, Bacillus, Ruminococcaceae incertae sedis, unclassified Bacilli, families Defluviitaleaceae, Morganellaceae, and Bacillaceae as well as lower abundance of the genus Blautia and family Sphingomonadaceae (P < 0.05).",research

Abstract: Introduction: different lines of evidence have shown that ginger administration may be beneficial for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of ginger supplementation on disability, physical and psychological quality of life (QoL), body mass index (BMI), neurofilament light chain (NfL), interlukin-17 (IL-17), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Methods: this was a 12 week double-blind parallel randomized placebo-controlled trial with a 3 week run-in period. The treatment (n = 26) and control (n = 26) groups received 500 mg ginger and placebo (corn) supplements 3 times daily, respectively. Disability was evaluated using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). QoL was rated using the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29). BMI was calculated by dividing weight by height squared. Serum levels of NfL, IL-17, and MMP-9 were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. NLR was determined using a Sysmex XP-300™ automated hematology analyzer. All outcomes were assessed before and after the intervention and analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle. Results: in comparison with placebo, ginger supplementation caused a significant reduction in the EDSS (-0.54 ± 0.58 vs. 0.08 ± 0.23, P < 0.001), the MSIS-29 physical scale (-8.15 ± 15.75 vs. 4.23 ± 8.46, P = 0.001), the MSIS-29 psychological scale (-15.71 ± 19.59 vs. 6.68 ± 10.41, P < 0.001), NfL (-0.14 ± 0.97 vs. 0.38 ± 1.06 ng mL-1, P = 0.049), IL-17 (-3.34 ± 4.06 vs. 1.77 ± 6.51 ng L-1, P = 0.003), and NLR (-0.09 ± 0.53 vs. 0.53 ± 1.90, P = 0.038). Nevertheless, the differences in BMI and MMP-9 were not significant between the groups. Conclusion: ginger supplementation may be an effective adjuvant therapy for patients with relapsing-remitting MS.",research

Abstract: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a highly prevalent chronic skin disease. Anti-inflammatory and antipruritic emollients (emollients plus) with excellent cosmetic properties may alleviate AD-related symptoms and reduce the number of exacerbations. To screen for herbal extracts with potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidative potential in human skin cell cultures. Ginger extract and synthetic cannabidiol (CBD) were identified and combined in the cosmetic product BNO 3731, which was evaluated in a randomized clinical trial. Preclinical: anti-inflammatory effects of ginger extract, synthetic CBD and a combination thereof were evaluated in human skin cell cultures by analysing nuclear factor κB activation, release of inflammatory cytokines and endocannabinoid production. Clinical: BNO 3731 was studied in a clinical trial comprising 44 AD patients (adults and children) and compared to a benchmark product over a treatment duration of five days. Symptom severity was evaluated by objective and subjective dermatological assessments as well as physiological skin parameters. Itch intensity was assessed using a numerical rating scale (NRS-11). Preclinical: Ginger extract and synthetic CBD exhibited potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects in vitro which were associated with elevated concentrations of the endocannabinoid, anandamide. Clinical: BNO 3731 significantly alleviated symptoms of AD and improved physiological skin parameters. Itch intensity decreased significantly by 55%, and in 75% of subjects, itch improved ≥2 points on the NRS-11 scale. No adverse events were reported.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ginger, a potent antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant remedy, is a potential therapeutic option for COVID-19. However, there was not enough clinical evidence about ginger and COVID-19. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of ginger on clinical and paraclinical features in outpatients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, the outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive ginger (1000 mg 3 times a day for 7 days) or placebo. The primary outcome was viral clearance after the end of the intervention. Oxygen saturation (SPO2), body temperature, respiratory rate (RR), hospital admission, and the incidence of adverse events were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients (42 in the ginger and 42 in the control groups) were randomized. The viral clearance was not statistically improved in the ginger group (41.6%) compared to the placebo group (42.8%). The findings indicated that SPO2, body temperature, and RR had no significant difference between the groups at the end of the intervention. The imaging finding indicated pulmonary infiltrate significantly reduced on the 7th day of the intervention in the ginger group. The percentage of patients with SPO2 <96% in the ginger group decreased over the study compared to the placebo group. Moreover, the need for hospital admission and the incidence of adverse drug events were not different between the groups over the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Ginger had no significant impact on the clinical and paraclinical parameters of patients. However, this intervention demonstrated a safe profile of adverse events and reduced pulmonary infiltrate.",research

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Nutraceuticals are gaining more and more importance as a knee osteoarthritis (KOA) complementary treatment. Among nutraceuticals, hemp seed oil and terpenes are proving to be very useful as therapeutic support for many chronic diseases, but there are still few studies regarding their effectiveness for treating KOA, both in combination and separately. The aim of this study is thus to compare the effect of two dietary supplements, both containing hemp seed oil, but of which only one also contains terpenes, in relieving pain and improving joint function in patients suffering from KOA. Materials and Methods: Thirty-eight patients were recruited and divided into two groups. The control group underwent a 45 day treatment with a hemp seed oil-based dietary supplement, while the treatment group assumed a hemp seed oil and terpenes dietary supplement for the same period. Patients were evaluated at the enrollment (T0) and at the end of treatment (T1). Outcome measures were: Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Short-Form-12 (SF-12), Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and Oxford Knee Score (OKS). Results: All outcome measures improved at T1 in both groups, but NRS, KOOS and OKS had a greater significant improvement in the treatment group only. Conclusions: Hemp seed oil and terpenes resulted a more effective integrative treatment option in KOA, improving joint pain and function and representing a good complementary option for patients suffering from osteoarthritis.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ginger and aloe vera are two medicinal herbs mostly used to produce mouthwash. This study aimed to compare the effects of ginger and aloe vera mouthwashes on the xerostomia in patients referred to Bandar Abbas diabetes clinic (Iran). MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this triple-blind clinical trial, three groups (n=35 patients in each group) were studied. One group was given aloe vera mouthwash, the other group used ginger mouthwash, and the control group was only given normal saline. All the mouthwashes were used 20 ccs three times daily for 14 consecutive days. The symptoms and severity of xerostomia were measured before and after the intervention by the questionnaire proposed by Fox et al. as well as VAS scale, respectively. Statistical analysis, including the Shapiro-Wilk test used to measure the normality of variables, and Chi-square and McNemar used to compare the scores questionnaire proposed by Fox et al., were also applied. Scores of VAS were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA test. P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant in all these tests. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants included in the normal saline group was 58.13±14.75 years old, 54.14±9.35 years old in the ginger group, and 53.37±11.57 years old in the aloe vera group. The difference between the scores of xerostomia before and after performing the intervention (The amount of reduction in xerostomia) in the ginger group was 6.12±2.004 cm, in the aloe vera group it was 4.08±2.09 cm, and in the normal saline group it was 2.45±2.09 cm. Finally, the ginger and aloe vera mouthwashes significantly reduced all symptoms and severity related to xerostomia, respectively(p<0.001).",research

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To prove the hypothesis that beetroot, watermelon and ginger juice supplementation improves the endometrial receptivity and clinical outcomes of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. METHODS: This prospective randomized study enrolled 436 female patients undergoing ICSI cycles from January/2018 to June/2021, in a private university-affiliated IVF center. Female patients were randomized in a 1:3 ratio to either Control (n=109) or Supplementation Group (n=327). All patients received nutritional orientation before the beginning of the treatment. Participants in the Supplementation Group were instructed to intake a daily dose of homemade juice, prepared with fresh beetroot, watermelon and ginger, from the day of embryo transfer until the day of pregnancy test, while patients in Control Group did not follow the juice protocol. Generalized Linear Models, adjusted for potential confounders (female age, body mass index - BMI, endometrial thickness upon embryo transfer, and number of transferred embryos), followed by Bonferroni post hoc test for the comparison of means between groups, were used to investigate the impact of juice supplementation on the clinical outcomes of ICSI. RESULTS: Patients and cycles characteristics were equally distributed among Supplementation and Control groups. Implantation rate (25.2% vs. 20.5%, p<0.001) and clinical pregnancy rate (41.0% vs. 22.0%, p=0.039) were significantly higher in the Supplementation compared to the Control group.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of frankincense (Boswellia serrata, oleoresin) and ginger (Zingiber officinale, rhizoma) as complementary treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) among women of reproductive age. DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial. SETTING: Gynecology outpatient clinics. INTERVENTIONS: Patients with HMB (n = 102) were randomly assigned to three groups. All patients received ibuprofen (200 mg) and either frankincense (300 mg), ginger (300 mg), or a placebo, which contains 200 mg anhydrous lactose as the filling agent and was similar in appearance to the two other drugs. Patients received the medications three times a day for seven days of the menstrual cycle, starting from the first bleeding day and this was repeated for two consecutive menstrual cycles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Amount and duration of menstrual bleeding and quality of life (QOL). RESULTS: Duration of menstrual bleeding was decreased in the frankincense (-1.77 ± 2.47 days, P = 0.003) and ginger (-1.8 ± 1.79 days, P = 0.001) groups, but not in the placebo group (-0.52 ± 1.86 days, P = 0.42). Amount of menstrual bleeding was decreased in all (P < 0.05), with no difference among the study groups (P > 0.05). More improvement in QOL was observed in the frankincense (-25.7 ± 3.1; P < 0.001) and ginger (-29.2 ± 3.7: P < 0.001) groups compared to the placebo group (-15.07 ± 3.52; P < 0.001) and between the groups, differences were statistically significant (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Ginger and frankincense seem to be effective complementary treatments for HMB. Further studies with a larger sample size and longer follow-up are warranted in this regard.",research

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to compare the effect of mefenamic acid and ginger on pain management in primary dysmenorrhea. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-two female students with moderate to severe primary dysmenorrhea were randomly allocated to the ginger and mefenamic groups in a randomized clinical trial. The mefenamic group received 250 mg capsules every 8 h, and the ginger group received 250 mg capsules (zintoma) every 6 h from the onset of menstruation until pain relief lasted 2 cycles. The intensity of pain was assessed by the visual analog scale. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, t test, Chi-square, Fisher exact test and repeated measurement. RESULTS: The pain intensity in the mefenamic and ginger group was 39.01 ± 17.77 and 43.49 ± 19.99, respectively, in the first month, and 33.75 ± 17.71 and 38.19 ± 20.47, respectively, in the second month (p > 0.05). The severity of dysmenorrhea, pain duration, cycle duration and bleeding volume was not significantly different between groups during the study. The menstrual days were more in the ginger group in the first (p = 0.01) and second cycle (p = 0.04). Repeated measurement showed a significant difference in pain intensity within the groups by time, but not between groups.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Supplements are commonly used by individuals with indications for lipid-lowering therapy, but evidence of their effectiveness to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is lacking, particularly when compared with statins. OBJECTIVES: The trial objective was to compare the efficacy of a low-dose statin with placebo and 6 common supplements in impacting lipid and inflammatory biomarkers. METHODS: This was a single-center, prospective, randomized, single-blind clinical trial among adults with no history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), an LDL-C of 70 to 189 mg/dL, and an increased 10-year risk of ASCVD. Participants were randomized to rosuvastatin 5 mg daily, placebo, fish oil, cinnamon, garlic, turmeric, plant sterols, or red yeast rice. The primary endpoint was the percent change in LDL-C from baseline for rosuvastatin 5 mg daily compared with placebo and each supplement after 28 days. The primary endpoint was evaluated in a hierarchical fashion with rosuvastatin first compared with placebo, then each supplement in a prespecified order using analysis of covariance. RESULTS: A total of 190 participants completed the study. The percent LDL-C reduction with rosuvastatin was greater than all supplements and placebo (P < 0.001). The difference in LDL-C reduction with rosuvastatin compared with placebo was -35.2% (95% CI: -41.3% to -29.1%; P < 0.001). None of the dietary supplements demonstrated a significant decrease in LDL-C compared with placebo. Adverse event rates were similar across study groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with increased 10-year risk for ASCVD, rosuvastatin 5 mg daily lowered LDL-C significantly more than placebo, fish oil, cinnamon, garlic, turmeric, plant sterols, and red yeast rice.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To compare the efficacy and safety of bioavailable turmeric extract versus paracetamol in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: In this randomized, non-inferiority, controlled clinical study, patients of knee OA were randomized to receive bioavailable turmeric extract (BCM-95®) 500 mg capsule two times daily or paracetamol 650 mg tablet three times daily for 6 weeks. The primary outcome measure was Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale. The secondary outcome measures were WOMAC total, WOMAC stiffness, and WOMAC physical function scores. Responder analysis of individual patients at different levels (≥ 20%, ≥ 50%, and ≥ 70%) for WOMAC score was calculated. TNF alpha and CRP levels were evaluated and adverse events (AE) were also recorded. RESULTS: Seventy-one and seventy-three knee OA patients, respectively in bioavailable turmeric extract and paracetamol groups, completed the study. Non-inferiority (equivalence) test showed that WOMAC scores were equivalent in both the groups (p value < 0.05) in all the domains within the equivalence limit defined by effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.5 whereas CRP and TNF-α were better reduced with turmeric extract than paracetamol. After 6 weeks of treatment, WOMAC total score, pain, stiffness, and function scores got a significant improvement of 23.59, 32.09, 28.5, and 20.25% respectively with turmeric extract. In the turmeric extract group, 18% of patients got more than 50% improvement and 3% of patients got more than 70% improvement in WOMAC pain and function/stiffness score and none of the patients in the paracetamol group met the criteria.

This study evaluated the effects of curcumin supplements on symptoms of pain in young women with PMS and dysmenorrhea. A randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was undertaken. Women who suffered from both PMS and dysmenorrhea were enrolled, and were randomly allocated to the curcumin (n = 62), or placebo (n = 62) groups. Each subject received one capsule (500 mg of curcuminoid, or placebo) daily, from 7 days pre- until 3 days post-menstruation for three successive menstrual cycles. Participants recorded the severity of PMS, or dysmenorrhea using a Premenstrual Syndrome Screening Tool (PSST) and the visual analog scale, respectively. Baseline characteristics of participants did not differ between the curcumin and placebo groups. At the end of the trial, the PSST scores were significantly lower in both the curcumin (32.5 ± 9.8 vs. 21.6 ± 9.8); and placebo groups (31.7 ± 9.4 vs. 23.4 ± 12.8). There was a significant reduction of dysmenorrhea pain in both the curcumin and placebo groups (by 64% and 53.3%, respectively). Hence, curcumin had comparable effects as placebo, regarding the amelioration of symptoms of PMS and dysmenorrhea. Further studies are required with larger samples, using higher doses curcumin for longer durations, and perhaps in combination therapy.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Curcumin is a biologically active phytochemical ingredient found in turmeric. It has several pharmacologic effects that might benefit patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized curcumin to be effective in improving blood sugar levels, insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism in individuals with PCOS. METHODS: In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, individuals with PCOS were treated with curcumin (500 mg three times daily) or placebo for 12 weeks. Primary outcome measures were fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin (FI), sex hormone levels, and hirsutism (Ferriman-Gallwey [mFG] score). Secondary outcomes included anthropometric measurements. RESULTS: Of 72 randomized individuals, 67 completed the trial. The two groups were comparable at baseline. At the end of the study, FPG and Dehydroepiandrosterone levels had decreased significantly in the intervention group compared to control (difference of change (post-pre) between intervention and placebo groups: -4.11 mg/dL; 95% CI: -8.35, -0.35 mg/dL; p = 0.033 and -26.53 microg/dL; 95% CI: -47.99, -4.34 µg/dL; p = 0.035, respectively). We also observed a statistically non-significant increase (p = 0.082) in Estradiol levels in the intervention group compared to control. No serious adverse events were reported throughout the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Curcumin might be a safe and useful supplement to ameliorate PCOS-associated hyperandrogenemia and hyperglycemia. However, longer trials investigating different dosages in longer durations are needed to underpin these findings.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is preliminary evidence to suggest curcumin can alleviate digestive symptoms in adults with self-reported digestive complaints and irritable bowel syndrome. However, in all these trials, curcumin was used as a component of a multi-herbal combination and there were consistent concerns associated with risk of bias in most studies. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of a curcumin extract (Curcugen™) on gastrointestinal symptoms, mood, and overall quality of life in adults presenting with self-reported digestive complaints. Moreover, to determine the potential therapeutic mechanisms of action associated with curcumin, its effects on intestinal microbiota and small intestinal bowel overgrowth (SIBO) were examined. METHODS: In this 8-week, parallel-group, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, 79 adults with self-reported digestive complaints were recruited and randomised to receive either a placebo or 500 mg of the curcumin extract, Curcugen™. Outcome measures included the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), intestinal microbial profile (16S rRNA), Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 (DASS-21), Short Form-36 (SF-36), and SIBO breath test. RESULTS: Based on self-report data collected from 77 participants, curcumin was associated with a significantly greater reduction in the GSRS total score compared to the placebo. There was also a greater reduction in the DASS-21 anxiety score. No other significant between-group changes in self-report data were identified. An examination of changes in the intestinal microbial profile and SIBO test revealed curcumin had no significant effect on these parameters.",research

Compared to the placebo, there were no significant changes in intestinal microbiota or SIBO; however, further research using larger samples and testing methods that allow more detailed microbial analyses will be important. An investigation into other potential mechanisms associated with curcumin's gastrointestinal-relieving effects will also be important such as examining its influence on the intestinal barrier function, inflammation, neurotransmitter activity, and visceral sensitivity.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aging is the primary risk factor for developing non-communicable chronic diseases, necessitating interventions targeting the aging process. Outcome measures of biological aging used in these interventions are mathematical algorithms applied to DNA methylation patterns, known as epigenetic clocks. The Methylation Diet and Lifestyle study was a pilot randomized controlled trial of a diet and lifestyle intervention that utilized epigenetic age as its primary outcome, measured using Horvath's clock. Significant reductions in epigenetic age post-intervention were observed but with notable variability. PURPOSE: This research aimed to identify dietary components associated with epigenetic age change across groups. Contributing factors to variability, such as weight changes and baseline differences in chronological and epigenetic age, were explored. RESULTS: In hierarchical linear regression, foods investigated as polyphenolic modulators of DNA methylation (green tea, oolong tea, turmeric, rosemary, garlic, berries) categorized in the original study as methyl adaptogens showed significant linear associations with epigenetic age change (B = -1.24, CI = [-2.80, -0.87]), after controlling for baseline epigenetic age acceleration and weight changes. Although the intervention group lost significantly more weight than the control group, these changes were not associated with epigenetic age changes in the regression model. These findings suggest that consuming foods categorized as methyl adaptogens may reduce markers of epigenetic aging.",research

Abstract: PURPOSE: Turmeric has renop rotective effects that can act to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Piperine has been indicated as a bioavailability enhancer of turmeric and consequently of its biological effects. However, data on the efficacy of the turmeric/piperine combination in HD patients are limited. We aimed to verify whether turmeric supplementation in combination with piperine has a superior effect to turmeric alone in increasing antioxidant capacity and reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in HD patients. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted in HD patients (age 20-75 years). Patients were supplemented with turmeric (3 g/day) or turmeric/piperine (3 g turmeric + 2 mg piperine/day) for 12 weeks. Malondialdehyde (MDA), antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and ferritin were evaluated at baseline and the end of the study. RESULTS: There was a reduction in the MDA and ferritin levels in the turmeric/piperine group and in the comparison between groups at the end of the study [MDA: -0.08(-0.14/0.01) nmol/mL versus -0.003(-0.10/0.26) nmol/mL, p = 0.003; ferritin: -193.80 ± 157.29 mg/mL versus 51.99 ± 293.25 mg/mL, p = 0.018]. In addition, GPx activity reduced in the turmeric group (p = 0.029). No changes were observed for CAT, GR, and hs-CRP.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Turmeric may alleviate exercise-induced muscle soreness (delayed onset muscle soreness) and muscular function loss due to the strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of its active compounds, the curcuminoids. The primary objective of this trial was to evaluate the effect of a highly bioavailable turmeric formulation on delayed onset muscle soreness in male adults. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04946981), 44 moderately active adults (34 males, 10 females, mean [SD] age = 33.7 [6.4] years) ingested a turmeric formulation (300 mg/day, thereof 90 mg of active curcuminoids) or placebo for five days. On the second day, muscle damage was induced with exercise (30 min downhill run at 70% VO₂ max). Immediately before and 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours post-exercise, muscle soreness during squat on quadriceps (visual analog scale), muscular function (knee extension dynamometer), muscle power (vertical jump test), muscle damage (serum creatine kinase), range of motion (knee flexion), and perceived wellness and wellbeing (questionnaire) were assessed. During exercise, exhaustion was assessed using the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion. The primary trial population consisted of the male participants, outcomes in females were considered exploratory. Adjusted least squares means with standard errors (SE) were obtained from mixed models for repeated measures.",research

Abstract: PURPOSE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with multisystem involvement. This study was designed to examine the effects of curcumin, a polyphenolic compound isolated from turmeric rhizomes, on inflammatory markers in SLE patients. METHODS: Seventy 18-60 years old SLE patients were recruited in this randomized triple-blinded placebo-controlled trial, and 62 completed the study. Curcumin group received 1000 mg curcumin daily and the placebo group received placebo capsules for 10 weeks. Dietary intakes and serum levels of complement C3 and C4, complement hemolytic 50%, rheumatoid factor, anti-double stranded DNA (anti-ds DNA), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interlukine-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α were assessed before and after intervention period. RESULTS: Curcumin supplementation caused a significant reduction in anti-ds DNA and IL-6 levels at the end of the trial in comparison with baseline (52.57 ± 40.21 vs. 43.27 ± 28.34, p = 0.014 and 127.11 ± 76.63 vs. 101.49 ± 59.08, p = 0.002, respectively). Analysis of covariance which was adjusted for confounding variables also revealed that anti-ds DNA and IL-6 levels decreased significantly in curcumin group compared to placebo group by the end of the intervention period (change:-9.30 ± 19.59 vs. -2.55 ± 17.55, p = 0.018 and - 25.62 ± 42.33 vs. -7.34 ± 34.32, p = 0.043, respectively). No significant changes were observed in levels of other variables during the study (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Curcumin as an effective and safe adjuvant therapy, ameliorated the autoimmune activity and inflammation in SLE patients via reducing anti-ds DNA and IL-6 levels.",research

Abstract: A recent randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study conducted by our research group, provided partial support for the efficacy of supplementation with a patented curcumin extract (500 mg, twice daily) for 8 weeks in reducing depressive symptoms in people with major depressive disorder. In the present paper, a secondary, exploratory analysis of salivary, urinary and blood biomarkers collected during this study was conducted to identify potential antidepressant mechanisms of action of curcumin. Pre and post-intervention samples were provided by 50 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder, and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-rated version (IDS-SR30) was used as the primary depression outcome measure. Compared to placebo, 8 weeks of curcumin supplementation was associated with elevations in urinary thromboxane B2 (p<0.05), and substance P (p<0.001); while placebo supplementation was associated with reductions in aldosterone (p<0.05) and cortisol (p<0.05). Higher baseline plasma endothelin-1 (rs=-0.587; p<0.01) and leptin (rs=-0.470; p<0.05) in curcumin-treated individuals was associated with greater reductions in IDS-SR30 score after 8 weeks of treatment. Our findings demonstrate that curcumin supplementation influences several biomarkers that may be associated with its antidepressant mechanisms of action. Plasma concentrations of leptin and endothelin-1 seem to have particular relevance to treatment outcome. Further investigations using larger samples sizes are required to elucidate these findings, as the multiple statistical comparisons completed in this study increased the risk of type I errors.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Robust evidence has related yellow passion fruit albedo and long turmeric to the metabolic and glycemic control of diabetes. AIM: To analyze the incremental cost-effectiveness of the flour made from yellow passion fruit albedo  METHOD: Eighty-nine patients were enrolled in this randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial for 120 days. The first group was prescribed 500 mg capsules, three times a day, of yellow passion fruit albedo flour (FAMA). The second group was prescribed long turmeric capsules (500 mg), merged with piperine (5 mg) (CURPI), at fasting. The third group followed the standard advice recommendations, and ingested a placebo of carboxymethyl cellulose (500 mg) at fasting. RESULTS: The group using FAMA showed a higher reduction (-5.9%) of glycemia after fasting, compared to placebo (+9%), and CURPI (-3.2%) (p < 0.05). Regarding HbA1c, the study observed a significant and similar statistical reduction (-0.8%) in the intervention groups, in contrast with the placebo group (p < 0.05). The reduction in HOMA-IR in the CURPI group (-9.4%) was higher than the other groups (p < 0.05). The CURPI group also showed a higher reduction of serum triglyceride levels (-20.8%) compared to the placebo (-0.09%) and FAMA (+1.8%) (p < 0.05) groups. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that turmeric is the most cost-effective in comparison with yellow passion fruit albedo, because of its decrease in the levels of triglycerides and HOMA-IR, even when adjusted for confounding variables. On the other hand, HbA1c cost-effectiveness relation was similar.",research

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical efficacy of Black seeds and Turmeric alone and its co-administration in lower doses among patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS). DESIGN: Double-blind-randomized-controlled trial. SETTING: Hijrat colony, Karachi, Pakistan. INTERVENTION: Apparently healthy males (n=250), who screened positive for MetS, were randomized to either Black seeds (1.5g/day), Turmeric (2.4g/day), its combination (900mg Black seeds and 1.5g Turmeric/day) or placebo for 8 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: body-mass-index (BMI), body-fat-percent (BF%), waist-circumference (WC), hip-circumference (HC), blood pressure (BP), lipid-profile (cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and TG), fasting blood glucose (FBG) and c-reactive protein (CRP). RESULTS: At 4 weeks, compared to baseline, Black seed and Turmeric alone showed improvement in BMI, WC and BF%. Combination improved all parameters except HDL-cholesterol with lower FBG and LDL-cholesterol as compared to placebo. At 8 weeks, compared to placebo, Black seeds reduced lipids and FBG, while Turmeric reduced LDL-cholesterol and CRP. Interestingly, combination group with 60% dose of the individual herbs showed an improvement in all parameters from baseline. When compared to placebo, it reduced BF%, FBG, cholesterol, TG, LDL-cholesterol, CRP and raised HDL-cholesterol. CONCLUSION: Turmeric and Black seeds showed improvement in all parameters of metabolic syndrome, when co-administered at 60% of doses of individual herbs with enhanced efficacy and negligible adverse-effects. The combination of Black seeds and Turmeric can therefore, be recommended with lifestyle modification as a starting point for patients with MetS to halt its future complications and progression.",research

Abstract: Gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) is the fourth leading global cause of cancer mortality and leading infection-associated cancer. High-incidence regions of GAC include Latin America and Eastern Asia. Immigrants from high-incidence regions maintain their GAC risk. GAC is a major U.S. cancer disparity, and its incidence rates are 2 to 10 times higher in non-White populations. Emerging guidelines recommend 3-year surveillance endoscopy for patients with high-risk gastric premalignant conditions (GPMC). Clinical trials of GPMC chemoprevention agents are lacking. We conducted a NCI Division of Cancer Prevention-funded, phase II placebo-controlled chemoprevention trial in patients with GPMCs (atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia) with a highly bioavailable preparation of curcuminoids (Meriva). The trial sites in Puerto Rico and rural Honduras had important characteristics: (i) representative Caribbean and Mesoamerican populations, linked to large U.S. immigrant populations; (ii) high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection and GPMCs; (iii) the absence of turmeric and curcuminoids in local diets; and (iv) proven bidirectional collaboration with U.S. academic institutions. H. pylori-negative patients with GPMCs were randomized to the study drug (500 mg po bid) or placebo for 180 days (NCT02782949), with primary outcomes based upon histologic parameters. Principal study challenges included (i) an international regulatory environment; (ii) research infrastructure strengthening, particularly in Central America; (iii) participant recruitment in Honduras, wherein only 10% to 15% are H. pylori negative; (iv) the COVID-19 pandemic; and (v) natural disasters (three hurricanes).",research

Abstract: This study investigated the effects of two dosages (750 mg and 1500 mg) of hydrolyzed curcumin on physiological recovery following exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD). In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind design, 34 recreationally active males (27 ± 6 years; 180 ± 7.3 cm; 82 ± 11.3 kg) were assigned to three groups: PLA (2 × 750-mg/day placebo), LOW (1 × 750-mg/day curcumin + 1 × 750-mg/day placebo), and HIGH (2 × 750-mg/day curcumin). Supplements were delivered in 15 mL gel sachets over 7 days, starting 48 h before EIMD. The EIMD protocol involved 8 sets of 10 repetitions at 110% of one-repetition maximum on the leg press, with 5-s eccentric phases and assisted concentric phases, targeting the quadriceps. Recovery was assessed pre, post, 24, 48, and 72 h post-EIMD via the Free Oxygen Radical Test (FORT), creatine kinase (CK), interleukin-6 (IL-6), isokinetic peak power, and a muscle endurance test (sustained isometric contraction at 50% peak torque). The HIGH group showed significantly greater reductions in pain, CK, FORT, and IL-6 (p < 0.05), but slower muscle endurance recovery at 24 h compared to LOW. Findings suggest a dose-response effect, with higher curcumin doses improving biochemical recovery but potentially impairing performance recovery.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intravesical instillation of hyaluronic acid (HA) has been associated with reduced sexual dysfunction in participants with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs), but the efficacy of an oral treatment has never been investigated. AIM: To investigate the efficacy of an oral preparation of HA, chondroitin sulfate, N-acetylglucosamine, and vitamin C in improving sexual and urinary symptoms in a cohort of reproductive-age participants with rUTI. METHODS: In a monocentric randomized crossover pilot trial, participants with rUTI who were referred to our institute between March 2022 and April 2023 were randomized 1:1 in 2 groups: intervention vs control. All participants had an oral preparation of cranberry, D-mannose, propolis extract, turmeric, and Boswellia twice a day for 3 months. The intervention group also included an oral preparation of HA, chondroitin sulfate, N-acetylglucosamine, and vitamin C once a day for 3 months. Crossover of treatment occurred at 3 months for an additional 3 months. At baseline and 3 and 6 months, participants were evaluated clinically and with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models tested the impact of the intervention on urinary and sexual symptoms at each follow-up assessment. OUTCOMES: Improvement in sexual and urinary symptoms as measured by the FSFI and IPSS. RESULTS: Overall, 27 (54%) participants had an FSFI score <26.5 at enrollment. At 3 months, FSFI scores were higher in the intervention group vs control (P < .001), but IPSS scores were lower (P = .03).",research

However, after crossover, the control group showed a significant improvement in IPSS and FSFI scores (all P < .01) vs the 3-month assessment. At last follow-up, urinary and sexual symptoms were comparable between groups. In logistic regression analyses, the intervention group was associated with early improvement in sexual symptoms (odds ratio, 3.9; P = .04) and urinary symptoms (odds ratio, 5.1; P = .01) after accounting for clinical confounders. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Combination treatment with HA, chondroitin sulfate, N-acetylglucosamine, and vitamin C is effective if started immediately or even after a few months from symptoms in participants with rUTI. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: The main limitation is the lack of long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: The oral formulation of HA, chondroitin sulfate, N-acetylglucosamine, and vitamin C could be an effective therapy against urinary and sexual distress in participants with rUTI (NCT06268483; ClinicalTrials.gov).",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND & AIMS: Turmeric (a source of curcumin) is an excellent food to modulate oxidative stress, inflammation, and gut dysbiosis in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, no studies report the benefits of curcumin in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). This study aims to evaluate the effects of curcuminoid supplementation on oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, and uremic toxins originating from gut microbiota in patients with CKD undergoing PD. METHODS: This longitudinal, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated 48 patients who were randomized into two groups: Curcumin (three capsules of 500 mg of Curcuma longa extract, with 98.42 % total curcuminoids) or placebo (three capsules of 500 mg of starch) for twelve weeks. In the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the transcriptional expression levels of Nrf2, HOX-1 and NF-κB were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR. Oxidative stress was evaluated by malondialdehyde (MDA) and total Thiol (T-SH). TNF-α and IL-6 plasma levels were measured by ELISA. P-cresyl sulphate plasma level, a uremic toxin, was evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescent detection. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients finished the study: 10 in the curcumin group (57.5 ± 11.6 years) and 14 in the placebo group (56.5 ± 10.0 years). The plasma levels of MDA were reduced after 12 weeks in the curcumin group (p = 0.01), while the placebo group remained unchanged. However, regarding the difference between the groups at the endpoint, no change was observed in MDA. Still, there was a trend to reduce the p-CS plasma levels in the curcumin group compared to the placebo group (p = 0.07).",research

Authors: Kirsti Uusi-Rasi, Radhika Patil, Saija Karinkanta et al. Published: May 2015

Abstract: IMPORTANCE: While vitamin D supplementation and exercise are recommended for prevention of falls for older people, results regarding these 2 factors are contradictory. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of targeted exercise training and vitamin D supplementation in reducing falls and injurious falls among older women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 2-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled vitamin D and open exercise trial conducted between April 2010 and March 2013 in Tampere, Finland. Participants were 409 home-dwelling women 70 to 80 years old. The main inclusion criteria were at least 1 fall during the previous year, no use of vitamin D supplements, and no contraindication to exercise. INTERVENTIONS: Four study groups, including placebo without exercise, vitamin D (800 IU/d) without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D (800 IU/d) and exercise. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was monthly reported falls. Injurious falls and the number of fallers and injured fallers were reported as secondary outcomes. In addition, bone density, physical functioning (muscle strength, balance, and mobility), and vitamin D metabolism were assessed. RESULTS: Intent-to-treat analyses showed that neither vitamin D nor exercise reduced falls. Fall rates per 100 person-years were 118.2, 132.1, 120.7, and 113.1 in the placebo without exercise, vitamin D without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D and exercise study groups, respectively; however, injurious fall rates were 13.2, 12.9, 6.5, and 5.0, respectively. Hazard ratios for injured fallers were significantly lower among exercisers with vitamin D (0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.83) and without vitamin D (0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.99).",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is often responsible for bone fragility and increased fracture risk due to the micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue. In addition to nutritional supplements, exercise is considered an adjunct factor in safeguarding bone health. This study aimed to investigate the effects of 16-week high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral density (BMD) in women with osteoporosis. TRIAL DESIGN: This study used a four-arm pretest-posttest experimental randomized controlled design. METHODS: One hundred twenty sedentary women aged (30-50 years), diagnosed with osteoporosis were recruited in this study. Patients were randomly classified into four groups with 30 patients in each group: control group (normal daily activities), exercise group (HIIT-exercise for 16 weeks), Vitamin D group (vitamin D 800IU/ day for 16 weeks), and concurrent group (HIIT exercise plus vitamin D for 16 weeks). Anthropometric measurements, BMD, and serum levels of vitamin 25-(OH) D, Osteocalcin, s-BAP, and calcium were estimated in all participants before and after exercise training. RESULTS: Serum samples revealed that bone resorption markers, osteocalcin, total calcium, s-BAP, and vitamin 25(OH) D significantly improved in all groups; there was greater improvement in the HIIT training-vitamin D group than in the HIIT training, vitamin D, and control groups. Furthermore, the HIIT training-vitamin D group showed improvements in hip (right and left) and lumbar spine BMD than the HIIT training, Vitamin D, and Control groups. BMD improvements correlated positively with serum osteocalcin levels and total calcium and negatively with BMI and s-BAP.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND & AIMS: Treatment of depression in elderly population is a crucial issue. The effect of vitamin D supplementation on treatment of depression in older adults was investigated in this clinical trial. METHODS: It was an 8-week, randomized clinical trial of vitamin D supplementation and placebo in the treatment of depression in 3 psychiatric clinics. The study sample included 78 older adults aged over 60 years with moderate to severe depression. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive 50,000 U vitamin D3 pearl weekly for 8 weeks or placebo (39 subjects in each group). Main outcome measures comprised Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15) questionnaire and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3]. The analysis utilized Mann Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed ranks test, chi-square and multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: The mean baseline 25(OH)D3 concentration was 22.57 ± 6.2 ng/ml in vitamin D group and 21.2 ± 5.8 ng/ml in placebo group (p = 0.16). The Vitamin D increased to 43.48 ± 9.5 ng/ml in vitamin D and 25.9 ± 15.3 ng/ml in placebo group. The depression score decreased from 9.25 to 7.48 in vitamin D group (p = 0.0001), while there was a non-significant increase in depression score in placebo group. The multiple regression analysis showed that the vitamin D group and the score of depression before study were the variables that could explain 81.8% of depression score after intervention.

Abstract: Vitamin D has a crucial role in female reproduction, possibly through its effects on calcium homeostasis, cyclic sex steroid hormone fluctuations, or neurotransmitter function. We have assessed the effects of vitamin D supplementation on dysmenorrhea and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in adolescents. In this study, 897 adolescent girls living in Mashhad and Sabzevar, Iran, received nine high-dose vitamin D supplements (as 50,000 IU/week of cholecalciferol) and were followed up over 9 weeks. We evaluated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on individuals in four categories: those with only PMS; individuals with only dysmenorrhea; subjects with both PMS and dysmenorrhea and normal subjects. The prevalence of PMS after the intervention fell from 14.9% to 4.8% (p < .001). Similar results were also found for the prevalence of subjects with dysmenorrhea (35.9% reduced to 32.4%), and in subjects with both PMS and dysmenorrhea (32.7% reduced 25.7%). Vitamin D supplementation was associated with a reduction in the incidence of several symptoms of PMS such as backache and tendency to cry easily as well as decrement in pain severity of dysmenorrhea (p < .05). High dose vitamin D supplementation can reduce the prevalence of PMS and dysmenorrhea as well as has positive effects on the physical and psychological symptoms of PMS.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The prevalence of vitamin D supplementation and the percentage of participants with a lack of appropriate vitamin D supplementation (""potential underuse"") or potentially inappropriate vitamin D supplementation (""potential overuse"") and risk factors for these are currently unclear. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis from the OPERAM study, a multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial in four European countries (Belgium, Ireland, The Netherlands, Switzerland) including multimorbid (≥ 3 chronic conditions) older patients, with polypharmacy (≥ 5 chronic medications). For the definition of potential underuse and overuse we used high-risk conditions, which were defined according to the START criteria (version 2) for potential prescribing omissions in older people i.e., E2) long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy, known osteoporosis or osteopenia, E3) previous fragility fractures, and E5) housebound/in nursing homes or experiencing falls. We used mixed effect logistic regression to identify factors associated with underuse and overuse. RESULTS: 2008 patients (79.4y, SD 6.3, 45% female) were included. 825/2008 (41.1%) were supplemented with vitamin D. We identified 681 participants with potential underuse (33.9% of all participants, 69.7% of non-vitamin D users) and 204 with potential overuse (10.2% of all participants, 24.7% of vitamin D users). In the multivariable logistic regression analysis increasing age and being male were associated with underuse, while the number of baseline medications and previous hospitalizations were associated with both underuse and overuse. Specifically, underuse decreased with an increasing number of medications (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.90-0.95), while overuse increased (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.04-1.12).",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The relationship between vitamin D and sarcopenia was inconsistent between men and women. Physical activity (PA) may interact with vitamin D on sarcopenia. However, the sex-specific relationships of vitamin D, PA and sarcopenia have yet elucidated. We aimed to examine the sex differences in the relation between vitamin D status, PA levels, obesity and sarcopenia in community-dwelling middle-aged and older adults, as well as whether vitamin D status is a modifier in the relationship between PA and sarcopenia. METHODS: The current study was a cross-sectional study based on the baseline survey of the West China Health and Aging Trend (WCHAT) study. A total of 3713 participants aged ≥ 50y were included in our study. Sarcopenia was defined according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) 2019 consensus. Obesity was defined by body mass index (BMI) (≥ 28 kg/m2) and body fat mass percentage (≥ 60th percentile in each sex group). 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay and PA was evaluated by a validated China Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (CLTPAQ). Multinomial logistic regression was performed to examine the relationship between PA, vitamin D and sarcopenia and obesity. RESULTS: Low PA was significantly associated with higher odds of sarcopenia in women only (OR = 1.70,95%CI:1.18,2.46, p < 0.01). Vitamin D deficiency was only associated with sarcopenia in men (OR = 1.85,95%CI: 1.27,2.69, p < 0.01).

Here we aim to evaluate whether vitamin D supplementation reduces risk of T2D in a general population of older US adults. The study design is an ancillary analysis (VITAL-T2D) of The Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL), a completed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2 × 2 trial of daily vitamin D",research

Abstract: COVID-19 symptoms vary from asymptomatic cases to moderate and severe illness with patients needing hospitalization and intensive care treatment. Vitamin D is associated with severity of viral infections and has an immune-modulatory effect in immune response. Observational studies showed a negative association of low vitamin D levels and COVID-19 severity and mortality outcomes. In this study, we aimed to determine whether daily supplementation of vitamin D during intensive care unit (ICU) stay in COVID-19 patients with severe illness affects clinically relevant outcomes. Patients with COVID-19 disease in need of respiratory support admitted to the ICU were eligible for inclusion. Patients with low vitamin D levels were randomized into one of two groups: the intervention group received daily supplementation of vitamin D and the control group did not receive vitamin D supplementation. In total, 155 patients were randomized: 78 into the intervention group and 77 into the control group. There was no statistically significant difference in number of days spent on respiratory support, although the trial was underpowered for the main outcome. There was no difference in any of the secondary outcomes analyzed between two groups. Our study suggests no benefit in vitamin D supplementation to patients with severe COVID-19 disease admitted to the ICU and in need of respiratory support in any of the analyzed outcomes.",research

Abstract: Vitamin D is reported to have anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects, yet vitamin D effects on hepatic fat content in children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are not studied sufficiently. We aimed to evaluate the role of vitamin D supplementation on the hepatic fat content and NAFLD progression in children. This randomized controlled clinical trial was performed on 109 children with biopsy-proven NAFLD; only 100 patients completed the study. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups: the treatment group who received 2000 IU/day vitamin D for 6 months and the control group who received a placebo. Anthropometric measurements, vitamin D levels, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total cholesterol (TC), serum triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting blood insulin level (FBI), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and serum calcium level were measured at the beginning and the end of the study. Liver biopsy was taken before and at the end of the study for all included children. There was a significant improvement of the hepatic steatosis and lobular inflammation by liver biopsy in the treatment group after treatment. However, there was no significant effect on the hepatocyte ballooning or hepatic fibrosis. There were significant decrease of AST, ALT, TG, LDL, FBG, FBI, and HOMA-IR and significant increase of vitamin D levels and HDL in the treatment group compared to the placebo group (P < 0.05).Conclusion: Vitamin D supplementation was found to be beneficial in the treatment of NAFLD in children.Trial registration: www.pactr.org , PACTR201710002634203.",research

Abstract: This study aimed to gain deeper knowledge about the relationship between vitamin D and physical activity in a sample of forensic inpatients. Sixty-seven male forensic inpatients participated. Participants were randomly assigned into an Intervention group (vitamin D) or a Control group (placebo). The Physical Activity-Rating (PA-R) questionnaire was used to measure physical activity from January to May. Vitamin D status was measured as 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OHD) pre- and post-intervention. The results revealed that vitamin D status at post-test was positively correlated with physical activity, but there was no effect of vitamin D supplementation looking at the two randomized groups. However, controlling for body mass index (BMI), the results showed an effect of BMI and a main effect of groups with a higher level of physical activity in the Intervention group. No interaction effects were found. Participants were also assigned into High and Low vitamin D groups based on the vitamin D status at post-test; i.e., the upper (75.1 nmol/L) and lower quartile (46.7 nmol/L). T-tests revealed that participants with a vitamin D status above 75 nmol/L showed significantly higher levels of physical activity than participants with a vitamin D status below 46.7 nmol/L. Thus, a vitamin D status above 75 nmol/L seems to be an optimal level.",research

Abstract: High-dose vitamin D supplementation can increase total osteocalcin concentrations that may reduce insulin resistance in individuals at risk for prediabetes or diabetes mellitus. Magnesium is a cofactor in vitamin D metabolism and activation. The purpose of this study was to determine the combined effect of vitamin D and magnesium supplementation on total osteocalcin concentrations, glycemic indices, and other bone turnover markers after a 12-week intervention in individuals who were overweight and obese, but otherwise healthy. We hypothesized that combined supplementation would improve serum total osteocalcin concentrations and glycemic indices more than vitamin D supplementation alone or a placebo.

Abstract: Objective: Treatment options in Graves' disease (GD) are limited and do not target the underlying autoimmunity, and relapse rates following a course of antithyroid drug (ATD) reach 50%. Previous research has shown promising results for a role of vitamin D in GD. We aimed to investigate whether vitamin D reduces failure to enter and sustain remission in patients with GD treated with ATD. Design: A multicenter, double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial comparing vitamin D 70 mcg once daily (2800 IU) or placebo. The intervention was given first as add-on to ATD treatment, maximally 24 months, and then for 12 months after ATD cessation. Inclusion period was from 2015 to 2017 and study completion by December 2020. Patients included were adults with a first-time diagnosis of GD treated with ATD. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy and glucocorticoid treatment. The primary endpoint was failure to enter and sustain remission defined as relapse of hyperthyroidism within 12 months after ATD cessation, inability to stop ATD within 24 months, or radioiodine treatment or thyroidectomy. Two hundred seventy-eight patients were included in the study, and 4 patients withdrew consent. No adverse effects were found. Results: Participants were aged 44 ± 14 years at enrollment and 79% were female. The risk of failure to enter and sustain remission was 42% [95% confidence interval (CI) 33-50%] in the vitamin D group and 32% [CI 24-40%] in the placebo group corresponding to a relative risk of 1.30 [CI 0.95-1.78]. Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation did not improve the treatment of GD in patients with normal or insufficient vitamin D status. Thus, supplementation with high-dose vitamin D cannot be recommended for GD. Study registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02384668.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Prior work suggests that patients with vitamin D insufficiency may have a higher risk of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) from paclitaxel. The objective of this study was to validate vitamin D insufficiency as a CIPN risk factor. METHODS: We used data and samples from the prospective phase III SWOG S0221 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00070564) trial that compared paclitaxel-containing chemotherapy regimens for early-stage breast cancer. We quantified pretreatment 25-hydroxy-vitamin D in banked serum samples using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry targeted assay. We tested the association between vitamin D insufficiency (≤20 ng/mL) and grade ≥3 sensory CIPN via multiple logistic regression and then adjusted for self-reported race, age, body mass index, and paclitaxel schedule (randomization to weekly or every-2-week dosing). We also tested the direct effect of vitamin D deficiency on mechanical hypersensitivity in mice randomized to a regular or vitamin D-deficient diet. RESULTS: Of the 1,191 female patients in the analysis, 397 (33.3%) had pretreatment vitamin D insufficiency, and 195 (16.4%) developed grade ≥3 CIPN. Patients with vitamin D insufficiency had a higher incidence of grade ≥3 CIPN than those who had sufficient vitamin D (20.7% vs 14.2%; odds ratio [OR], 1.57; 95% CI, 1.14-2.15; P=.005). The association retained significance after adjusting for age and paclitaxel schedule (adjusted OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.18-2.30; P=.003) but not race (adjusted OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.98-1.97; P=.066).

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate vitamin D status and effects of vitamin D intervention on bone mineral density (BMD) and content (BMC) in children with fair and dark skin in Sweden during winter. METHODS: In a 2-center prospective double-blinded randomized intervention study 5- to 7-year-old children (n = 206) with fair and dark skin in Sweden (55°N-63°N) received daily vitamin D supplements of 25 μg, 10 μg, or placebo (2 μg) during 3 winter months. We measured BMD and BMC for total body (TB), total body less head (TBLH), femoral neck (FN), and spine at baseline and 4 months later. Intake of vitamin D and calcium, serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (S-25[OH]D), and related parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: Despite lower S-25(OH)D in dark than fair-skinned children, BMD of TB (P = 0.012) and TBLH (P = 0.002) and BMC of TBLH (P = 0.04) were higher at baseline and follow-up in those with dark skin. Delta (Δ) BMD and BMC of TB and TBLH did not differ between intervention and placebo groups, but FN-BMC increased more among dark-skinned children in the 25 μg (P = 0.038) and 10 μg (P = 0.027) groups compared to placebo. We found no associations between Δ S-25(OH)D, P-parathyroid hormone, P-alkaline phosphatase, and Δ BMD and BMC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: BMD and BMC remained higher in dark- than fair-skinned children despite lower vitamin D status. Even though no difference in general was found in BMD or BMC after vitamin D intervention, the increase in FN-BMC in dark-skinned children may suggest an influence on bone in those with initially insufficient vitamin D status.",research

Abstract: In the past 50 y, there has been a decline in average sleep duration and quality, with adverse consequences on general health. A representative survey of 1,508 American adults recently revealed that 90% of Americans used some type of electronics at least a few nights per week within 1 h before bedtime. Mounting evidence from countries around the world shows the negative impact of such technology use on sleep. This negative impact on sleep may be due to the short-wavelength-enriched light emitted by these electronic devices, given that artificial-light exposure has been shown experimentally to produce alerting effects, suppress melatonin, and phase-shift the biological clock. A few reports have shown that these devices suppress melatonin levels, but little is known about the effects on circadian phase or the following sleep episode, exposing a substantial gap in our knowledge of how this increasingly popular technology affects sleep. Here we compare the biological effects of reading an electronic book on a light-emitting device (LE-eBook) with reading a printed book in the hours before bedtime. Participants reading an LE-eBook took longer to fall asleep and had reduced evening sleepiness, reduced melatonin secretion, later timing of their circadian clock, and reduced next-morning alertness than when reading a printed book. These results demonstrate that evening exposure to an LE-eBook phase-delays the circadian clock, acutely suppresses melatonin, and has important implications for understanding the impact of such technologies on sleep, performance, health, and safety.",research

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic condition with hyperglycemia. Literature has shown a correlation between poor sleep quality and duration with an increased incidence of insomnia in diabetic individuals. The goal of this study was to determine the magnesium and potassium supplementation effect among diabetic individuals with insomnia. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial (single blind) was conducted on 320 patients with diabetes; after 2 months of follow-up, 290 patients completed the trial. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) was used to assess the severity and duration of insomnia, before and after the trial. Tablets containing supplements were prepared: placebo (T1), magnesium (Mg, T2), potassium (K, T3), and a combination of Mg and K (T4). Melatonin and cortisol (sleep hormones) were measured from blood (serum) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), before and after the trial. RESULTS: The study included 93 (32.1%) male and 197 (67.9%) female participants. According to the analysis, there was a significant association between the treatment groups and ISI after the trial (post-trial),  CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that magnesium, potassium, and magnesium and potassium combined had a significant effect on serum cortisol and melatonin levels (sleep hormones).

Abstract: Among cardiovascular diseases, hypertension is one of the main risk factors predisposing to fatal complications. Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation have been identified as potentially responsible for the development of endothelial damage and vascular stiffness, two of the primum movens of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Based on these data, we conducted an open-label randomized study, first, to evaluate the endothelial damage and vascular stiffness in hypertense patients; second, to test the effect of supplementation with a physiological antioxidant (melatonin 1 mg/day for 1 year) in patients with essential hypertension vs. hypertensive controls. Twenty-three patients of either gender were enrolled and randomized 1:1 in two groups (control and supplemented group). The plasmatic total antioxidant capacity (as a marker of oxidative stress), blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and peripheral endothelial function were evaluated at the beginning of the study and after 1 year in both groups.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of exogenous melatonin supplementation for sleep disturbances in patients with middle-aged primary insomnia. METHODS: This is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel study. Participants were recruited from Tianlin community, Xuhui district, Shanghai. Ninety-seven consecutive middle-aged patients with primary insomnia were randomized to receive 3 mg fast-release melatonin (n = 51) or placebo (n = 46) for four-weeks. Objective sleep parameters tested by overnight polysomnography, subjective sleep performance and daytime somnolence obtained from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were obtained at baseline and after treatment. Treatment was taken daily 1 h before bedtime. Serious adverse events and side-effects were monitored. RESULTS: Melatonin supplementation significantly decreased early wake time [-30.63min (95% CI, -53.92 to -7.34); P = 0.001] and percentage of N2 sleep [-7.07% (95% CI, -13.47% to -0.68%); P = 0.031]. However, melatonin had no significant effect on other objective sleep parameters including sleep latency, sleep efficiency, wake during the sleep and percent of N1, N3 and REM sleep. Melatonin had no effect on insomnia symptoms and severity on the PSQI [1.53(95% CI, -0.55 to 3.61); p = 0.504]; ISI [0.81 (95% CI, -2.27 to 3.88); p = 0.165] and ESS [-0.83 (95% CI, -3.53 to 1.88); p = 0.147].

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether the use of exogenous melatonin affects sleep, reduces the prevalence of delirium, and decreases the need for analgosedation and to assess whether serum melatonin indices correlate with exogenous administration in critically ill patients. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Multicenter ICUs of two tertiary hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 203 adult patients who were admitted to the ICU and administered with analgesics and/or sedatives. INTERVENTIONS: Oral melatonin (10 mg) or placebo for up to seven consecutive nights. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The number of observed sleeping hours at night was assessed by the bedside nurse. Sleep quality was evaluated using the Richards Campbell Questionnaire Sleep (RCSQ). The prevalence of delirium, pain, anxiety, adverse reactions, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU and hospital stays, and doses of sedative and analgesic drugs administered were recorded. The use of analgesics and sedatives was assessed daily. Melatonin levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To determine the dose of melatonin with an optimal pharmacokinetic profile and to test whether this dose reduces the prevalence of delirium in mechanically ventilated ICU patients as compared to placebo. METHODS: DEMEL, a multicenter adaptive phase 2b/3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial included patients at 20 health centers in France from February 1st, 2019 through January 5th, 2021. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive either placebo or low (0.3 mg) or high (3 mg) dose melatonin enterally at 9:00 p.m. for 14 consecutive nights or until death or ICU discharge, whichever came first. The interim primary endpoint (activity stage) was the percentage of patients who achieved an optimal melatonin pharmacokinetic profile 24 h after starting study treatment; the final primary endpoint (efficacy phase) was the percentage of patients who experienced delirium between randomization and day 14 (or until death or ICU discharge, whichever came first). Delirium was assessed twice daily using the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU. RESULTS: We randomized 355 patients and included 334 in the primary analysis. At the preplanned analysis of the activity stage performed in 75 patients, the low-dose melatonin group had the highest rate of optimal pharmacokinetic profiles (12/24, 50%) when compared with the high-dose melatonin group (6/25, 24%) and the placebo group (0/26).

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of novel pediatric-appropriate, prolonged-release melatonin minitablets (PedPRM) versus placebo for insomnia in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with or without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) comorbidity, and neurogenetic disorders (NGD). METHOD: A total of 125 children and adolescents (2-17.5 years of age; 96.8% ASD, 3.2% Smith-Magenis syndrome [SMS]) whose sleep failed to improve on behavioral intervention alone were randomized (1:1 ratio), double-blind, to receive PedPRM (2 mg escalated to 5 mg) or placebo for 13 weeks. Sleep measures included the validated caregivers' Sleep and Nap Diary (SND) and Composite Sleep Disturbance Index (CSDI).

Abstract: PURPOSE: Delirium is common in the critically ill, highly distressing to patients and families and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Results of studies on preventative use of melatonin in various patient groups have produced mixed results. The aim of this study was to determine whether administration of melatonin decreases the prevalence of delirium in critically ill patients. METHODS: Multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial across 12 Australian ICUs recruiting patients from July 2016 to September 2019. Patients of at least 18 years requiring ICU admission with an expected length of stay (LOS) greater than 72 h; enrolled within 48 h of ICU admission. Indistinguishable liquid melatonin (4 mg; n = 419) or placebo (n = 422) was administered enterally at 21:00 h for 14 consecutive nights or until ICU discharge. The primary outcome was the proportion of delirium-free assessments, as a marker of delirium prevalence, within 14 days or before ICU discharge. Delirium was assessed twice daily using the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM-ICU) score. Secondary outcomes included sleep quality and quantity, hospital and ICU LOS, and hospital and 90-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 847 patients were randomized into the study with 841 included in data analysis. Baseline characteristics of the participants were similar. There was no significant difference in the average proportion of delirium-free assessments per patient between the melatonin and placebo groups (79.2 vs 80% respectively, p = 0.547).",research

Abstract: Smartphones deliver light to users through Light Emitting Diode (LED) displays. Blue light is the most potent wavelength for sleep and mood. This study investigated the immediate effects of smartphone blue light LED on humans at night. We investigated changes in serum melatonin levels, cortisol levels, body temperature, and psychiatric measures with a randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled design of two 3-day admissions. Each subject played smartphone games with either conventional LED or suppressed blue light from 7:30 to 10:00PM (150 min). Then, they were readmitted and conducted the same procedure with the other type of smartphone. Serum melatonin levels were measured in 60-min intervals before, during and after use of the smartphones. Serum cortisol levels and body temperature were monitored every 120 min. The Profile of Mood States (POMS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and auditory and visual Continuous Performance Tests (CPTs) were administered. Among the 22 participants who were each admitted twice, use of blue light smartphones was associated with significantly decreased sleepiness (Cohen's d = 0.49, Z = 43.50, p = 0.04) and confusion-bewilderment (Cohen's d = 0.53, Z = 39.00, p = 0.02), and increased commission error (Cohen's d = -0.59, t = -2.64, p = 0.02). Also, users of blue light smartphones experienced a longer time to reach dim light melatonin onset 50% (2.94 vs. 2.70 h) and had increases in body temperature, serum melatonin levels, and cortisol levels, although these changes were not statistically significant.",research

Published: Aug 2022

Abstract: Aging is associated with changes in sleep, and improving sleep may have important consequences for the health, cognition, and quality of life of older adults. Many prescription sleep aids increase the risk of nighttime falls, have adverse effects on next-day cognition, and are associated with increased mortality. Melatonin, a hormone secreted at night, increases sleep duration in young adults but only when administered during the day when endogenous levels are low. In a month-long cross-over study, we randomized 24 healthy older (age >55, mean 64.2 ± 6.3 years) participants to receive 2 weeks of placebo and 2 weeks of either a low (0.3 mg) or high (5.0 mg) dose of melatonin 30 min before lights out. Sleep was polysomnographically recorded and was scheduled during both the biological day and night using a forced desynchrony design. Although 0.3 mg melatonin had a trend towards increasing sleep efficiency (SE) overall, this was due to its effects on sleep during the biological day. In contrast, 5 mg melatonin significantly increased SE during both biological day and night, mainly by increasing the duration of Stage 2 non-rapid eye movement sleep and slightly shortening awakenings. Melatonin should be further explored as a sleep aid for older adults.",research

Abstract: Sleep disturbances are extremely common (40-86%) in children and adolescents, especially those with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and are often among the first symptoms identified by parents at a very early stage of their child's development. These abnormalities are among the main parental concerns when having a child with ASD and have a significant impact on the quality of life of patients, their parents, and more broadly their siblings. Sleep disorders are essentially abnormalities of the sleep-wake rhythm - primarily sleep onset insomnia or nocturnal awakenings (with difficulty falling back to sleep). These disturbances can be accompanied by other sleep disorders, requiring notably a systematic elimination of the presence of a sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome - to ensure a personalized and efficient therapeutic approach. Physiologically, the determinants of these sleep disorders are poorly understood, even though several studies point to a significant decrease in melatonin synthesis in people with ASD. Melatonin is a hormone that facilitates falling asleep and maintaining sleep and is also involved in the endogenous synchronization of internal biological clocks. However, the causal factors of this decrease in melatonin synthesis are largely unknown, involving to a small extent the genes involved in melatonin synthesis pathway. The treatment of sleep disorders is relatively systematic: after eliminating other specific sleep disorders associated with the complaint of insomnia, as well as other possible associated comorbidities (such as seizures), a global and graduated therapeutic approach must be put in place. This treatment will be non-pharmacological as a first line, then pharmacological as a second line.",research
pubmed_35120753_2,[Therapeutic approaches for sleep and rhythms disorders in children with ASD].,PubMed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35120753/,Public Domain,2026-01-26,"A number of non-pharmacological treatment strategies for sleep disorders in typically developing children and adolescents, as well as those with ASD, have been shown to be effective. This treatment requires a combination of: 1) parental education to promote sleep development; 2) setting up bedtime rituals adapted to the child's age and particularities; 3) specific behavioral strategies including bedtime fading, gradual extinction and positive reinforcement of adapted behaviors. It is very essential that the parents are accompanied throughout this therapy. Sleep hygiene and behavioral care must also take into consideration the important role of the zeitgebers of sleep-wake rhythms, i.e. the external environmental factors involved in the synchronization of the biological clocks: regular exposure to light at adapted times, regular meal and wake-up times, social activities and times for going to school. The evidence for the effectiveness of behavioral interventions in the treatment of behavioral insomnia in the typical developmental child is strong, since 94% of children show clinically significant improvements in nighttime sleepiness and waking. By contrast, only about 25% of children with ASD are improved by an approach combining sleep hygiene and behavioral therapy. Melatonin has a special and prominent place in the drug management of sleep disorders associated with ASD. Several clinical trials have shown that melatonin is effective in treating sleep disorders in patients with ASD. This work led to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granting marketing authorization in September 2018 for a sustained-release paediatric melatonin molecule (Slenyto®). This synthetic molecule is a prolonged release melatonin (PRM) which mimics the physiological pharmacokinetic and secretory characteristics of endogenous melatonin, having a very short blood half-life and prolonged secretion for several hours during the night.",research

Published: Sep 2015

Abstract: Caffeine's wakefulness-promoting and sleep-disrupting effects are well established, yet whether caffeine affects human circadian timing is unknown. We show that evening caffeine consumption delays the human circadian melatonin rhythm in vivo and that chronic application of caffeine lengthens the circadian period of molecular oscillations in vitro, primarily with an adenosine receptor/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-dependent mechanism. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, ~49-day long, within-subject study, we found that consumption of a caffeine dose equivalent to that in a double espresso 3 hours before habitual bedtime induced a ~40-min phase delay of the circadian melatonin rhythm in humans. This magnitude of delay was nearly half of the magnitude of the phase-delaying response induced by exposure to 3 hours of evening bright light (~3000 lux, ~7 W/m(2)) that began at habitual bedtime. Furthermore, using human osteosarcoma U2OS cells expressing clock gene luciferase reporters, we found a dose-dependent lengthening of the circadian period by caffeine. By pharmacological dissection and small interfering RNA knockdown, we established that perturbation of adenosine receptor signaling, but not ryanodine receptor or phosphodiesterase activity, was sufficient to account for caffeine's effects on cellular timekeeping. We also used a cyclic AMP biosensor to show that caffeine increased cyclic AMP levels, indicating that caffeine influenced a core component of the cellular circadian clock. Together, our findings demonstrate that caffeine influences human circadian timing, showing one way that the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug affects human physiology.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM)-associated hyperinflammatory host response significantly provokes periodontal tissue destruction. In this context, the support of nonsurgical periodontal therapy in diabetics with host modulation agents is a current field of study. This clinical study aims to investigate the clinical efficacy of melatonin supplementation and discuss its possible biological mechanisms in nonsurgical periodontal treatment in patients with DM and periodontitis through some fundamental markers. METHODS: In this randomized controlled and single-blind study, 27 of 55 diabetic patients with periodontitis (stage III/IV and grade C) underwent full-mouth scaling and root planing (fmSRP) alone and 28 patients underwent melatonin administration (6 mg daily, 30 days) in addition to fmSRP (full-mouth scaling and root planing plus melatonin, fmSRP-mel). The potential therapeutic contribution of melatonin was evaluated clinically and biochemically (gingival crevicular fluid RANKL, OPG, MMP-8, and serum IL-1β levels) at 3rd and 6th months. RESULTS: Melatonin (tablet, 6 mg daily, 30 days) did not cause any local or systemic side effects. fmSRP alone resulted in significant reduction in serum IL-1β levels, pocket depths, gingival inflammation, and gingival crevicular fluid RANKL and MMP-8 levels (p < 0.05). Moreover, melatonin supplementation resulted in a more significant decrease in bleeding and pocket depth scores at probing, especially at 3 months (p < 0.05). Furthermore, RANKL and MMP-8 levels were significantly lower at 3 months and IL-1β levels at 6 months compared to the control group (p < 0.05).

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Melatonin has been studied in headache disorders. Amitriptyline is efficacious for migraine prevention, but its unfavourable side effect profile limits its use. METHODS: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out. Men and women, aged 18-65 years, with migraine with or without aura, experiencing 2-8 attacks per month, were enrolled. After a 4-week baseline phase, 196 participants were randomised to placebo, amitriptyline 25 mg or melatonin 3 mg, and 178 took a study medication and were followed for 3 months (12 weeks). The primary outcome was the number of migraine headache days per month at baseline versus last month. Secondary end points were responder rate, migraine intensity, duration and analgesic use. Tolerability was also compared between groups. RESULTS: Mean headache frequency reduction was 2.7 migraine headache days in the melatonin group, 2.2 for amitriptyline and 1.1 for placebo. Melatonin significantly reduced headache frequency compared with placebo (p=0.009), but not to amitriptyline (p=0.19). Melatonin was superior to amitriptyline in the percentage of patients with a greater than 50% reduction in migraine frequency. Melatonin was better tolerated than amitriptyline. Weight loss was found in the melatonin group, a slight weight gain in placebo and significantly for amitriptyline users. CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin 3 mg is better than placebo for migraine prevention, more tolerable than amitriptyline and as effective as amitriptyline 25 mg.",research

Abstract: Because 80%-90% of our time is spent indoors and daylight is the main synchronizer of the central biological clock, the chronic lack of daylight is increasingly considered as a risk factor for metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes. In a randomized crossover design (NCT05263232), 13 individuals with type 2 diabetes were exposed to natural daylight facilitated through windows vs. constant artificial lighting during office hours for 4.5 consecutive days. Continuous glucose monitoring revealed that participants spent more time in the normal glucose range, and whole-body substrate metabolism shifted toward a greater reliance on fat oxidation during daylight. Primary myotubes cultured from skeletal muscle biopsies displayed a phase advance after daylight exposure. Multi-omic analyses revealed daylight-induced differences in serum metabolites, lipids, and monocyte transcripts. Our findings suggest that natural daylight exposure has a positive metabolic impact on individuals with type 2 diabetes and could support the treatment of metabolic diseases.",research

Abstract: Probiotics have been proposed to ameliorate cognitive impairment and depressive disorder via the gut-brain axis in patients and experimental animal models. However, the beneficial role of probiotics in brain functions of healthy older adults remains unclear. Therefore, a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled multicenter trial was conducted to determine the effects of probiotics on cognition and mood in community-dwelling older adults. Sixty-three healthy elders (≥65 years) consumed either placebo or probiotics containing Bifidobacterium bifidum BGN4 and Bifidobacterium longum BORI for 12 weeks. The gut microbiota was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatics. Brain functions were measured using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease, Satisfaction with life scale, stress questionnaire, Geriatric depression scale, and Positive affect and negative affect schedule. Blood brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Relative abundance of inflammation-causing gut bacteria was significantly reduced at Week 12 in the probiotics group (p < .05). The probiotics group showed greater improvement in mental flexibility test and stress score than the placebo group (p < .05). Contrary to placebo, probiotics significantly increased serum BDNF level (p < .05). Notably, the gut microbes significantly shifted by probiotics (Eubacterium and Clostridiales) showed significant negative correlation with serum BDNF level only in the probiotics group (RS = -0.37, RS = -0.39, p < .05).",research

Abstract: A promising new treatment approach for major depressive disorder (MDD) targets the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis, which is linked to physiological and behavioral functions affected in MDD. This is the first randomized controlled trial to determine whether short-term, high-dose probiotic supplementation reduces depressive symptoms along with gut microbial and neural changes in depressed patients. Patients with current depressive episodes took either a multi-strain probiotic supplement or placebo over 31 days additionally to treatment-as-usual. Assessments took place before, immediately after and again four weeks after the intervention. The Hamilton Depression Rating Sale (HAM-D) was assessed as primary outcome. Quantitative microbiome profiling and neuroimaging was used to detect changes along the MGB axis. In the sample that completed the intervention (probiotics N = 21, placebo N = 26), HAM-D scores decreased over time and interactions between time and group indicated a stronger decrease in the probiotics relative to the placebo group. Probiotics maintained microbial diversity and increased the abundance of the genus Lactobacillus, indicating the effectivity of the probiotics to increase specific taxa. The increase of the Lactobacillus was associated with decreased depressive symptoms in the probiotics group. Finally, putamen activation in response to neutral faces was significantly decreased after the probiotic intervention.",research

Abstract: IMPORTANCE: The effects of probiotic interventions on colonization with resistant bacteria and early microbiome development in preterm infants remain to be clarified. OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of Bifidobacterium longum subsp infantis, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis (BB-12), and Lactobacillus acidophilus (La-5) probiotics to prevent colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms or highly epidemic bacteria (MDRO+) and to shape the microbiome of preterm infants toward the eubiotic state of healthy full-term infants. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, group sequential, phase 3 Priming Immunity at the Beginning of Life (PRIMAL) randomized clinical trial, conducted from April 2018 to June 2020, included infants with gestational age of 28 to 32 weeks at 18 German neonatal units. Data analyses were conducted from March 2020 to August 2023. INTERVENTION: A total of 28 days of multistrain probiotics diluted in human milk/formula starting within the first 72 hours of life. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Colonization with MDRO+ at day 30 of life (primary end point), late-onset sepsis and severe gastrointestinal complication (safety end points), and gut dysbiosis, ie, deviations from the microbiome of healthy, term infants (eubiosis score) based on 16-subunit ribosomal RNA and metagenomic sequencing. RESULTS: Among the 643 infants randomized until the stop of recruitment based on interim results, 618 (median [IQR] gestational age, 31.0 [29.7-32.1] weeks; 333 male [53.9%]; mean [SD] birth weight, 1502 [369] g) had follow-up at day 30.",research

Abstract: Probiotics are widely prescribed for prevention of antibiotics-associated dysbiosis and related adverse effects. However, probiotic impact on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the gut mucosal host-microbiome niche remains elusive. We invasively examined the effects of multi-strain probiotics or autologous fecal microbiome transplantation (aFMT) on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the murine and human mucosal microbiome niche. Contrary to homeostasis, antibiotic perturbation enhanced probiotics colonization in the human mucosa but only mildly improved colonization in mice. Compared to spontaneous post-antibiotic recovery, probiotics induced a markedly delayed and persistently incomplete indigenous stool/mucosal microbiome reconstitution and host transcriptome recovery toward homeostatic configuration, while aFMT induced a rapid and near-complete recovery within days of administration. In vitro, Lactobacillus-secreted soluble factors contributed to probiotics-induced microbiome inhibition. Collectively, potential post-antibiotic probiotic benefits may be offset by a compromised gut mucosal recovery, highlighting a need of developing aFMT or personalized probiotic approaches achieving mucosal protection without compromising microbiome recolonization in the antibiotics-perturbed host.",research

Abstract: Human gut microbiome is a promising target for managing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Measures altering gut microbiota like oral intake of probiotics or berberine (BBR), a bacteriostatic agent, merit metabolic homoeostasis. We hence conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with newly diagnosed T2D patients from 20 centres in China. Four-hundred-nine eligible participants were enroled, randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) and completed a 12-week treatment of either BBR-alone, probiotics+BBR, probiotics-alone, or placebo, after a one-week run-in of gentamycin pretreatment. The changes in glycated haemoglobin, as the primary outcome, in the probiotics+BBR (least-squares mean [95% CI], -1.04[-1.19, -0.89]%) and BBR-alone group (-0.99[-1.16, -0.83]%) were significantly greater than that in the placebo and probiotics-alone groups (-0.59[-0.75, -0.44]%, -0.53[-0.68, -0.37]%, P < 0.001). BBR treatment induced more gastrointestinal side effects. Further metagenomics and metabolomic studies found that the hypoglycaemic effect of BBR is mediated by the inhibition of DCA biotransformation by Ruminococcus bromii. Therefore, our study reports a human microbial related mechanism underlying the antidiabetic effect of BBR on T2D. (Clinicaltrial.gov Identifier: NCT02861261).",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide; with evidence suggesting that decreased gut barrier function and inflammation are correlated with depressive symptoms. We conducted a clinical trial to determine the effect of consumption of probiotic supplements (Winclove's Ecologic® Barrier) on depressive symptoms in a sample of participants with mild to severe depression. METHOD: 71 participants were randomly allocated to either probiotic or placebo, which was, consumed daily over eight weeks. Pre- and post-intervention measures of symptoms and vulnerability markers of depression as well as gut microbiota composition were compared. Clinical trial participants were also compared on psychological variables and gut microbiota composition to a non-depressed group (n = 20). RESULTS: All clinical trial participants demonstrated improvement in symptoms, suggesting non-specific therapeutic effects associated with weekly monitoring visits. Participants in the probiotic group demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in cognitive reactivity compared with the placebo group, particularly in the mild/moderate subgroup. Probiotics did not significantly alter the microbiota of depressed individuals, however, a significant correlation was found between Ruminococcus gnavus and one depression metric. LIMITATIONS: There was a high attrition rate, which may be attributed to weekly monitoring visits. Additionally, modulation of the gut microbiota may need more specific testing to distinguish subtle changes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have established that probiotics or prebiotics can relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (AR), but their mechanism of action remain underexplored. This study aimed to observe the clinical efficacy of probiotics combined with prebiotics in seasonal AR patients and explore their underlying mechanisms. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Outcome measures included total nasal symptom score (TNSS), visual analog scale, rhinitis quality of life questionnaire, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and the rate and intensity of Loratadine use. Serum TNF-α, INF-γ, IL-4, IL-17, and IgE levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Intestinal microbiota was detected by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR. Short-chain fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: 106 participants (N = 53 for both test group and placebo group) completed the study.

Abstract: The current study aims to evaluate the potential roles of taking probiotics postoperatively in attenuating the gastrointestinal complications and disturbed gut microbiota in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients undergoing chemotherapy. One hundred eligible CRC patients who were treated with radical surgery and needed to receive chemotherapy were recruited. Half of them were randomly assigned to the Probio group to take a probiotic combination from post-operation to the end of the first chemotherapeutic course. The other half of patients taking placebo instead were classified as the Placebo group. Gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, acid reflux, abdominal pain, abdominal distention, constipation, and diarrhea were recorded during chemotherapy. Fecal samples were collected preoperatively and after the first cycle of postoperative chemotherapy for 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) analysis. Results showed that probiotics administration could effectively reduce chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal complications, particularly in diarrhea (p < 0.01). Additionally, chemotherapy also reduced the bacterial diversity indexes of the gut microbiota in CRC patients, which could be significantly increased by taking probiotics. Moreover, this chemotherapy caused significant changes in the composition of the gut microbiota, as indicated by decreased phylum levels of Firmicutes and increased Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. In particular, several bacterial genera such as Akkermansia and Clostridium were significantly increased, while Prevotella, Lactobacillus, and Roseburia were decreased (p < 0.05).",research

Abstract: The prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is increasing, but its etiology remains elusive and hence an effective treatment is not available. Previous research conducted on animal models suggests that microbiota-gut-brain axis may contribute to ASD pathology and more human research is needed. This study was divided into two stages,.At the discovery stage, we compared the differences in gut microbiota profiles (using 16S rRNA sequencing), fecal SCFAs (using GC-MS) and plasma neurotransmitters (using UHPLC-MS/MS) of 26 children with ASD and 24 normal children. All 26 children with ASD participated in the intervention stage, and we measured the gut microbiota profiles, SCFAs and neurotransmitters before and after probiotics + FOS (n = 16) or placebo supplementation (n = 10). We found that gut microbiota was in a state of dysbiosis and significantly lower levels of Bifidobacteriales and Bifidobacterium longum were observed at the discovery stage in children with ASD. An increase in beneficial bacteria (Bifidobacteriales and B. longum) and suppression of suspected pathogenic bacteria (Clostridium) emerged after probiotics + FOS intervention, with significant reduction in the severity of autism and gastrointestinal symptoms. Compared to children in the control group, significantly lower levels of acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid were found, and a hyperserotonergic state (increased serotonin) and dopamine metabolism disorder (decreased homovanillic acid) were observed in children with ASD. Interestingly, the above SCFAs in children with autism significantly elevated after probiotics + FOS intervention and approached those in the control group.",research

Abstract: Empiric probiotics are commonly consumed by healthy individuals as means of life quality improvement and disease prevention. However, evidence of probiotic gut mucosal colonization efficacy remains sparse and controversial. We metagenomically characterized the murine and human mucosal-associated gastrointestinal microbiome and found it to only partially correlate with stool microbiome. A sequential invasive multi-omics measurement at baseline and during consumption of an 11-strain probiotic combination or placebo demonstrated that probiotics remain viable upon gastrointestinal passage. In colonized, but not germ-free mice, probiotics encountered a marked mucosal colonization resistance. In contrast, humans featured person-, region- and strain-specific mucosal colonization patterns, hallmarked by predictive baseline host and microbiome features, but indistinguishable by probiotics presence in stool. Consequently, probiotics induced a transient, individualized impact on mucosal community structure and gut transcriptome. Collectively, empiric probiotics supplementation may be limited in universally and persistently impacting the gut mucosa, meriting development of new personalized probiotic approaches.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: A high prevalence of a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms is frequently reported in patients with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The GI disturbances in ASD might be linked to gut dysbiosis representing the observable phenotype of a ""gut-brain axis"" disruption. The exploitation of strategies which can restore normal gut microbiota and reduce the gut production and absorption of toxins, such as probiotics addition/supplementation in a diet, may represent a non-pharmacological option in the treatment of GI disturbances in ASD. The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the effects of supplementation with a probiotic mixture (Vivomixx®) in ASD children not only on specific GI symptoms, but also on the core deficits of the disorder, on cognitive and language development, and on brain function and connectivity. An ancillary aim is to evaluate possible effects of probiotic supplementation on urinary concentrations of phthalates (chemical pollutants) which have been previously linked to ASD. METHODS: A group of 100 preschoolers with ASD will be classified as belonging to a GI group or to a Non-GI (NGI) group on the basis of a symptom severity index specific to GI disorders. In order to obtain four arms, subjects belonging to the two groups (GI and NGI) will be blind randomized 1:1 to regular diet with probiotics or with placebo for 6 months.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Widespread antibiotic resistance has sparked interest in the identification of nonantibiotic strategies, particularly probiotics for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). We evaluated the effectiveness of prophylactic probiotic supplementation through oral and intravaginal routes in the prevention of recurrent UTIs. METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 174 premenopausal women with a history of recurrent UTIs and randomized them to 1 of the 4 treatment groups: placebo (G1, oral placebo + vaginal placebo), oral probiotic (G2, oral lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria + vaginal placebo), vaginal probiotic (G3, oral placebo + vaginal lactobacilli), and probiotic combination (oral lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria + vaginal lactobacilli), for 4 months. Participants were followed up for symptomatic UTIs for 1 year. The primary end points were the number of symptomatic UTIs at 4 months, the proportion of participants with at least 1 symptomatic UTI, and the time to the first symptomatic UTI.

Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Growing interest in microbial dysbiosis during critical illness has raised questions about the therapeutic potential of microbiome modification with probiotics. Prior randomized trials in this population suggest that probiotics reduce infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), although probiotic-associated infections have also been reported. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG on preventing VAP, additional infections, and other clinically important outcomes in the intensive care unit (ICU). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized placebo-controlled trial in 44 ICUs in Canada, the United States, and Saudi Arabia enrolling adults predicted to require mechanical ventilation for at least 72 hours. A total of 2653 patients were enrolled from October 2013 to March 2019 (final follow-up, October 2020). INTERVENTIONS: Enteral L rhamnosus GG (1 × 1010 colony-forming units) (n = 1321) or placebo (n = 1332) twice daily in the ICU. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was VAP determined by duplicate blinded central adjudication. Secondary outcomes were other ICU-acquired infections including Clostridioides difficile infection, diarrhea, antimicrobial use, ICU and hospital length of stay, and mortality. RESULTS: Among 2653 randomized patients (mean age, 59.8 years [SD], 16.5 years), 2650 (99.9%) completed the trial (mean age, 59.8 years [SD], 16.5 years; 1063 women [40.1%.] with a mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 22.0 (SD, 7.8) and received the study product for a median of 9 days (IQR, 5-15 days).",research

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The management of obesity is difficult with many failures of lifestyle measures, hence the need to broaden the range of treatments prescribed. The aim of our work was to study the influence of pre and probiotics on weight loss psychological profile and metabolic parameters in obese patients. METHODS: It is a clinical trial involving 45 obese patients, recruited from the Obesity Unit of the National Institute of Nutrition between March and August 2022 divided into three groups: diet only (low-carbohydrate and reduced energy diet), prebiotics (30 g of carob/day) and probiotics (one tablet containing Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus/day). The three groups were matched for age, sex and BMI. Patients were seen after 1 month from the intervention. Anthropometric measures, biological parameters, dietary survey and psychological scores were performed. RESULTS: The average age of our population was 48.73 ± 7.7 years, with a female predominance. All three groups showed a significant decrease in weight, BMI and waist circumference with p < .05. Only the prebiotic and probiotic group showed a significant decrease in fat mass (p = .001) and a significant increase in muscle strength with p = .008 and .004, but the differences were not significant between the three groups. Our results showed also a significant decrease in insulinemia and HOMA-IR in the prebiotic group compared to the diet-alone group (p = .03; p = .012) and the probiotic group showed a significant decrease in fasting blood glucose compared to the diet alone group (p = .02).",research

Published: Feb 2023

Abstract: Food-drug interactions should be suspected when a patient is taking their medications as directed and doses are optimized yet therapy is still not optimal (increased adverse effects, decreased efficacy, new adverse effects, etc). In all individuals with suspected food-drug interactions, diet history, baseline laboratory values, drug concentrations, and prescription history are recommended to assess the patient for a possible food-drug interaction. The 3 types of food-drug interactions are pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic. Pharmaceutical interactions occur with delivery devices or enteral feeding products. Pharmacokinetic interactions include the processes of a drug's release, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and/or elimination, ultimately affecting the effectiveness and safety of therapy. Pharmacodynamic interactions occur when food alters a drug's clinical effect on the body. The most common food-drug interactions exist with fruits (especially grapefruit), dairy, vitamin K, tyramine-containing foods, and alcohol. Patient counseling and collaboration between health-care teams can help patients avoid food-drug interactions. As a result, medication therapy can be optimized and adverse effects can be avoided.",research

Abstract: Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic medication frequently used in practice for both ventricular and atrial arrhythmias. Though classified as a class III antiarrhythmic, it affects all phases of the cardiac action potential. However, the drug has several side effects, including thyroid abnormalities, pulmonary fibrosis, and transaminitis, for which routine monitoring is recommended. It also interacts with several medications, such as warfarin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin, and many HIV antiretroviral medications. Given the common use of this medication in medical practice, it is vital that clinicians understand the indications, contraindications, dosing, side effects, and interactions of this medication.

Published: Jul 2017

Abstract: Nearly 25% of U.S. adults report concurrently taking a prescription medication with a dietary supplement. Some supplements, such as St. John's wort and goldenseal, are known to cause clinically important drug interactions and should be avoided by most patients receiving any pharmacologic therapy. However, many other supplements are predicted to cause interactions based only on in vitro studies that have not been confirmed or have been refuted in human clinical trials. Some supplements may cause interactions with a few medications but are likely to be safe with other medications (e.g., curcumin, echinacea, garlic, Asian ginseng, green tea extract, kava kava). Some supplements have a low likelihood of drug interactions and, with certain caveats, can safely be taken with most medications (e.g., black cohosh, cranberry, ginkgo, milk thistle, American ginseng, saw palmetto, valerian). Clinicians should consult reliable dietary supplement resources, or clinical pharmacists or pharmacologists, to help assess the safety of specific herbal supplement-drug combinations. Because most patients do not disclose supplement use to clinicians, the most important strategy for detecting herb-drug interactions is to develop a trusting relationship that encourages patients to discuss their dietary supplement use.",research

Published: Mar 2021

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hypertension is remarkably prevalent, affecting an estimated 1.13 billion people worldwide. It often requires the use of multi-drug regimens and is commonly associated with a myriad of other comorbidities which increase medication use. The pervasive use of antihypertensive medications combined with the presence of polypharmacy in many hypertensive patients results in significant risk of drug interactions. This review will summarize the relevant literature to assist clinicians in mitigating drug interaction risks when prescribing antihypertensives. RECENT FINDINGS: Pharmacokinetic interactions affect drug disposition in the body and can occur at the steps of absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination of involved medications. Data has established the calcium channel blockers, namely, diltiazem and verapamil, as potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, and the majority of significant drug interactions involving antihypertensives are attributable to these two agents. Although less common, pharmacokinetic drug interactions with other antihypertensive classes have also been identified. Pharmacodynamic drug interactions with antihypertensives lead to synergy or antagonism of blood pressure lowering effects and can increase or mitigate adverse effects depending on the agents involved. Knowledge is emerging about drug-induced phenoconversion, a phenomenon whereby a drug interaction results in a drug metabolizing phenotype that is different than that predicted by an individual's genotype. Antihypertensive use in patients with comorbidities and polypharmacy increases the likelihood of encountering important drug-drug interactions. Dedicated efforts to better understand the relationship between pharmacokinetic drug interactions and pharmacogenomic information is important to advance efforts related to personalized medicine.",research

Abstract: Introduction: MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), a synthetic ring-substituted amphetamine, has become one of the most widely used recreational psychostimulant drugs in the world. Among recreational ecstasy/MDMA users, polydrug use is a phenomenon whose common purpose is to experience the synergistic effect of the combined drugs, moderate MDMA effects, prevent potential toxicity, enhance a high or come down from a high from other drugs, or simply to treat existing medical conditions. Thus, MDMA-drug interactions (MDMA-DIs) lead to a higher risk of acute and life-threatening MDMA toxicity.Areas covered: This article provides an overview of the MDMA-DIs with pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse. In addition, available evidence is summarized along with clinical recommendations. Finally, the increasing importance of MDMA-DIs is highlighted.Expert opinion: There is a reduced number of published MDMA-DIs studies and scarce clinically significant MDMA-DIs documented in the literature. Experimental evidence points out the relevance of MDMA-DI's when MDMA is co-administered with pharmaceuticals that are metabolized by the CYP2D6 due to MDMA inhibitory action and in the case of repeated MDMA administration (MDMA-MDMAIs).",research

Abstract: Food effect, also known as food-drug interactions, is a common phenomenon associated with orally administered medications and can be defined as changes in absorption rate or absorption extent. The mechanisms of food effect and their consequences can involve multiple factors, including human post-prandial physiology, properties of the drug, and how the drug is administered. Therefore, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of these mechanisms when recommending whether a specific drug should be taken with or without food. Food-drug interactions can be clinically relevant, especially when they must be avoided to prevent undesirable effects or exploited to optimize medication therapy. This review conducts a literature search that examined studies on food effect. We summarized the literature and identified and discussed common food effect mechanisms. Furthermore, we highlighted drugs that have a clinically significant food effect and discussed the corresponding mechanisms. In addition, this review analyzes the effects of high-fat food or standard meals on the oral drug absorption rate and absorption extent for 229 drugs based on the Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System and demonstrates an association between Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System class and food effect.",research

Abstract: Modeling and simulation of drug disposition has emerged as an important tool in drug development, clinical study design and regulatory review, and the number of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling related publications and regulatory submissions have risen dramatically in recent years. However, the extent of use of PBPK modeling by researchers, and the public availability of models has not been systematically evaluated. This review evaluates PBPK-related publications to 1) identify the common applications of PBPK modeling; 2) determine ways in which models are developed; 3) establish how model quality is assessed; and 4) provide a list of publically available PBPK models for sensitive P450 and transporter substrates as well as selective inhibitors and inducers. PubMed searches were conducted using the terms ""PBPK"" and ""physiologically based pharmacokinetic model"" to collect published models. Only papers on PBPK modeling of pharmaceutical agents in humans published in English between 2008 and May 2015 were reviewed. A total of 366 PBPK-related articles met the search criteria, with the number of articles published per year rising steadily. Published models were most commonly used for drug-drug interaction predictions (28%), followed by interindividual variability and general clinical pharmacokinetic predictions (23%), formulation or absorption modeling (12%), and predicting age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and disposition (10%).

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) occur when one drug adds to or diminishes the effect of another drug (ie, pharmacodynamic interaction) or affects the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of another drug (ie, pharmacokinetic interaction). Such interactions cause 26% of all adverse drug events (ADEs) and are associated with a significant burden on the health care system through increased hospitalizations. Some of the most common DDIs result from alterations in drug metabolism through interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes and absorption through interactions with P-glycoproteins. Other common DDIs occur because of additive effects, including combinations of drugs that increase the risk of seizures, prolong the QT interval, increase central nervous system depression, and increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. Drug-related clinical decision support has been shown to improve the quality of patient care and decrease ADE rates. However, alerts generated by such systems should be interpreted using clinical judgment to determine the risks and benefits of certain drugs on a patient-specific basis. Family physicians can prevent clinically significant DDIs and optimize drug safety by using drug interaction software, along with a general understanding of common DDI mechanisms and collaboration with pharmacists.",research

Abstract: Natural products have been used by humans since antiquity for both egregious and beneficial purposes. Regarding the latter, these products have long been valued as a rich source of phytochemicals and developed into numerous life-saving pharmaceutical agents. Today, the sales and use of natural products with purported medicinal qualities continue to increase worldwide. However, natural products are not subject to the same premarket testing requirements as pharmaceutical agents, creating critical gaps in scientific knowledge about their optimal use. In addition, due to the common misperception that ""natural"" means ""safe,"" patients may supplement or replace their prescription medications with natural products, placing themselves at undue risk for subefficacious pharmacotherapy or potentially toxic exposure. Collectively, with few exceptions, researchers, health care providers, and educators lack definitive information about how to inform consumers, patients, and students in the health professions on the safe and optimal use of these products. Recognition of this deficiency by key stakeholders, including the three pillars of biomedical research-industry, academia, and government-has facilitated multiple collaborations that are actively addressing this fundamental knowledge gap. This special issue contains a collection of articles highlighting the challenges faced by researchers in the field and the use of various experimental systems and methods to improve the mechanistic understanding of the disposition and drug interaction potential of natural products.

Abstract: In India, traditional herbal medicines have been an essential part of therapy for the last centuries. However, a large portion of the general populace is using these therapies in combination with allopathy lacking a proper understanding of possible interactions (synergistic or antagonistic) between the herbal product and the allopathic drug. This is based on the assumption that herbal drugs are relatively safe, i.e. without side effects. We have established a comprehensive understanding of the possible herb-drug interactions and identified interaction patterns between the most common herbs and drugs currently in use in the Indian market. For this purpose, we listed common interactors (herbs and allopathic drugs) using available scientific literature. Drugs were then categorized into therapeutic classes and aligned to produce a recognizable pattern present only if interactions were observed between a drug class and herb in the scientific literature. Interestingly, the top three categories (with highest interactors), antibiotics, oral hypoglycemics, and anticonvulsants, displayed synergistic interactions only. Another major interactor category was CYP450 enzymes, a natural component of our metabolism. Both activation and inhibition of CYP450 enzymes were observed. As many allopathic drugs are known CYP substrates, inhibitors or inducers, ingestion of an interacting herb could result in interaction with the co-administered drug. This information is largely unavailable for the Indian population and should be studied in greater detail to avoid such interactions. Although this information is not absolute, the systematic literature review proves the existence of herb-drug interactions in the literature and studies where no interaction was detected are equally important.",research

Published: Dec 2019

Abstract: Cola-containing drinks (CCDs) are among the most common drinks in the world. There are some reports on interactions between CCDs and some drugs. However, there is no review on reported and possible interactions of CCDs. Thus, this paper attempted to provide a comprehensive review on this subject. It is well-accepted that CCDs are acidic and contain caffeine. It has been suggested that these two properties potentiate interactions of CCDs with different drugs in the context of both pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic, which includes drug absorption, metabolism, and renal excretion of drugs. It has been shown that serum concentrations of MTX, clozapine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and ibuprofen increased following CCD consumption; these interactions can be toxic. Additionally, it has been reported that serum levels of lithium and warfarin were decreased and their efficacy reduced when simultaneously administered with CCDs. Serum concentrations of erlotinib and different azoles, including itraconazol, posaconazole, and ketoconazole, have been shown to increase when these drugs were co-administered with a CCD. As proposed and discussed here, CCDs have the potential for interactions with numerous other drugs and thus clinicians should be aware of reported and potential interactions of CCDs with various medications in order to avoid adverse reactions and achieve expected clinical response.",research

Abstract: The most common applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in drug treatment have to do with matching patients to their optimal drug or combination of drugs, predicting drug-target or drug-drug interactions, and optimizing treatment protocols. This review outlines some of the recently developed AI methods aiding the drug treatment and administration process. Selection of the best drug(s) for a patient typically requires the integration of patient data, such as genetics or proteomics, with drug data, like compound chemical descriptors, to score the therapeutic efficacy of drugs. The prediction of drug interactions often relies on similarity metrics, assuming that drugs with similar structures or targets will have comparable behavior or may interfere with each other. Optimizing the dosage schedule for administration of drugs is performed using mathematical models to interpret pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data. The recently developed and powerful models for each of these tasks are addressed, explained, and analyzed here.",research

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Medications have the potential to affect nutritional status in negative ways, especially as the number of medications increase. The inter-relation between polypharmacy and malnutrition is complex and not fully delineated in previous studies. More research has been done and compiled in the last year, which helps to clarify this relationship. This review brings together the most recent literature with the previous research to help healthcare providers to better assess and manage medication therapy in older adults. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent evidence confirms a synergistic negative effect of polypharmacy and malnutrition on outcomes of older adults. In addition, several drug classes, including common antihypertensive agents, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, multivitamins, proton pump inhibitors, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), antiplatelet agents and metformin, have been implicated in important drug-nutrient interactions. These are reviewed in detail here. Ongoing research endeavors are described. SUMMARY: Healthcare practitioners can use this review to identify potentially inappropriate medications and patients at highest risk of experiencing a medication-related adverse reaction in order to systematically deprescribe these high-risk medications.",research

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate potentially inappropriate medications, potential drug-drug interactions, and prescribing practices in elderly ambulatory patients. METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional study on 275 elderly patients attending different outpatient departments. We used the Screening Tool for Older Person's Prescriptions criteria version two to identify potentially inappropriate medications, IBM Micromedex, to categorize potential drug-drug interactions as major and moderate. World Health Organization prescribing indicators were used to evaluate prescribing practices. RESULTS: The prevalence of potentially inappropriate medications in 275 prescriptions was 21.9%. Diclofenac was the most common inappropriate drug (n=23). Metoprolol is the second most inappropriate drug (n=12). Amlodipine and clopidogrel, aspirin and furosemide, and aspirin and spironolactone together accounted for 71.42% of major interactions (n=15). Atorvastatin and clopidogrel was the most common moderate drug-drug interaction in our study (n=24). The average number of drugs per encounter, the percentage of drugs with a generic name, and the percentage of drugs from the essential drugs list must be improved. CONCLUSION: There is a need to provide awareness through education about the explicit criteria to identify potentially inappropriate medications and prescribing indicators that aid in rational prescribing in the elderly.",research

Abstract: PURPOSE: Polypharmacy is prevalent in older adults starting cancer treatment and associated with potentially inappropriate medications (PIM), potential drug-drug interactions (DDI), and drug-cancer treatment interactions (DCI). For a large cohort of vulnerable older adults with advanced cancer starting treatment, we describe patterns of prescription and nonprescription medication usage, the prevalence of PIM, and the prevalence, severity, and type of DDI/DCI. METHODS: This secondary analysis used baseline data from a randomized study enrolling patients aged ≥70 years with advanced cancer starting a new systemic cancer treatment (University of Rochester Cancer Center [URCC] 13059; PI: Mohile). PIM were categorized using 2019 Beers criteria and Screening Tool of Older Persons' Prescriptions. Potential DDI/DCI were evaluated using Lexi-Interact Online. Medication classification followed the World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical system. Bivariate associations were evaluated between sociodemographic and geriatric assessment (GA) measures and medication measures. Chord diagrams and network analysis were used to understand and describe DDI/DCI. RESULTS: Among 718 patients (mean age 77.6 years), polypharmacy (≥5 medications), excessive polypharmacy (≥10 medications), and ≥1 PIM were identified in 61.3%,14.5%, and 67.1%, respectively. Cardiovascular medications were the most prevalent (47%), and nonprescription medications accounted for 26% of total medications and 40% of PIM. One-quarter of patients had ≥1 potential major DDI not involving cancer treatment, and 5.4% had ≥1 potential major DCI. Each additional medication increased the odds of a potential major DDI and DCI by 39% and 12%, respectively.",research

Abstract: AIMS: To present an updated overview on the safety of concurrent use of food, herbal or dietary supplement and warfarin. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed on 5 databases from inception up to 31 December 2019. These interactions were classified depending on the likelihood of interaction and supporting evidences. RESULTS: A total of 149 articles describing 78 herbs, food or dietary supplements were reported to interact with warfarin. These reports described potentiation with 45 (57.7%) herbs, food or dietary supplements while 23 (29.5%) reported inhibition and 10 (12.8%) reported limited impact on warfarin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Twenty unique herb and dietary supplements also reported to result in minor bleeding events, such as purpura and gum bleeding as well as major events such as intracranial bleeding that led to death. CONCLUSION: While most food, herbs and supplements can be safely taken in moderation, healthcare professionals should be aware of the increased risk of bleeding when taking several food and herbs. These include Chinese wolfberry, chamomile tea, cannabis, cranberry, chitosan, green tea, Ginkgo biloba, ginger, spinach, St. John's Wort, sushi and smoking tobacco. Patients should be counselled to continue to seek advice from their healthcare professionals when starting any new herbs, food or supplement.",research

Abstract: Over 70% of Americans take some form of dietary supplement every day, and the supplement industry is currently big business, with a gross of over $28 billion. However, unlike either foods or drugs, supplements do not need to be registered or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prior to production or sales. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, the FDA is restricted to adverse report monitoring postmarketing. Despite widespread consumption, there is limited evidence of health benefits related to nutraceutical or supplement use in well-nourished adults. In contrast, a small number of these products have the potential to produce significant toxicity. In addition, patients often do not disclose supplement use to their physicians. Therefore, the risk of adverse drug-supplement interactions is significant. An overview of the major supplement and nutraceutical classes is presented here, together with known toxic effects and the potential for drug interactions.",research

Abstract: Drug interactions can have significant consequences for public health, especially given the growing importance of readily available dietary supplements. The same applies to the consumption of fruit and fruit juices, which are often praised for their health benefits, but which can generate drug interactions. These are well known and documented in the case of grapefruit, which should not be taken with certain medications. Grapefruit contains flavonoids and furanocoumarins, which are responsible for various interactions with the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. However, for young children and the elderly, fruit juices are often used to facilitate treatment. This review examines commonly used fruit juices, particularly from citrus, apple, and red fruits, and discusses potential interactions, disadvantages, and advantages, as well as the chemical structures involved in interactions with cytochromes P-450, P-glycoprotein, and organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP), responsible for sometimes dangerous changes in bioavailability or potential accumulation of drugs in the body.",research

Published: 2019

Abstract: Probiotics have been used to treat a variety of diseases for decades; however, what is the rationale for their application? Such a treatment was first proposed in the early nineteenth century based on observations of decreased bifidobacterial populations in children suffering from diarrhea, suggesting that oral intake of bifidobacteria could replete this subpopulation of the microbiota and improve health. Since then, studies have shown modifications in the gut or skin microbiota in the course of a variety of diseases and suggested positive effects of certain probiotics. Most studies failed to report any impact on the microbiota. The impact of probiotics as well as of bacteria colonizing food does not reside in their ability to graft in the microbiota but rather in sharing genes and metabolites, supporting challenged microbiota, and directly influencing epithelial and immune cells. Such observations argue that probiotics could be associated with conventional drugs for insulin resistance, infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases, and psychiatric disorders and could also interfere with drug metabolism. Nevertheless, in the context of a plethora of probiotic strains and associations produced in conditions that do not allow direct comparisons, it remains difficult to know whether a patient would benefit from taking a particular probiotic. In other words, although several mechanisms are observed when studying a single probiotic strain, not all individual strains are expected to share the same effects. To clarify the role of probiotics in the clinic, we explored the relation between probiotics and the gut and skin microbiota.",research

Abstract: Riboflavin (RF) is a water-soluble member of the B-vitamin family. Sufficient dietary and supplemental RF intake appears to have a protective effect on various medical conditions such as sepsis, ischemia etc., while it also contributes to the reduction in the risk of some forms of cancer in humans. These biological effects of RF have been widely studied for their anti-oxidant, anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive and anti-cancer properties. Moreover, the combination of RF and other compounds or drugs can have a wide variety of effects and protective properties, and diminish the toxic effect of drugs in several treatments. Research has been done in order to review the latest findings about the link between RF and different clinical aberrations. Since further studies have been published in this field, it is appropriate to consider a re-evaluation of the importance of RF in terms of its beneficial properties.",research

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death in the world. For almost 60 years, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were the mainstay of anticoagulation therapy, but in recent years direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have become the anticoagulant treatment of choice. DOACs were initially considered drugs with no significant food interactions; however, clinical observations from daily practice have proved otherwise as interactions with food ingredients have been reported. Food, dietary supplements or herbs may contain substances that, when administered concomitantly with DOACs, can potentially affect the plasma concentration of the drugs. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the clinical significance of drug-food interactions of DOACs, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban.

Abstract: Use of herbal medications and supplements has experienced immense growth over the last two decades, with retail sales in the USA exceeding $13 billion in 2021. Since the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994 reduced FDA oversight, these products have become less regulated. Data from 2012 shows 18% of U.S. adults used non-vitamin, non-mineral natural products. Prevalence varies regionally, with higher use in Western states. Among preoperative patients, the most commonly used herbal medications included garlic, ginseng, ginkgo, St. John's wort, and echinacea. However, 50-70% of surgical patients fail to disclose their use of herbal medications to their physicians, and most fail to discontinue them preoperatively. Since herbal medications can interact with anesthetic medications administered during surgery, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA) recommend stopping herbal medications 1-2 weeks before elective surgical procedures. Potential adverse drug effects related to preoperative use of herbal medications involve the coagulation system (e.g., increasing the risk of perioperative bleeding), the cardiovascular system (e.g., arrhythmias, hypotension, hypertension), the central nervous system (e.g., sedation, confusion, seizures), pulmonary (e.g., coughing, bronchospasm), renal (e.g., diuresis) and endocrine-metabolic (e.g., hepatic dysfunction, altered metabolism of anesthetic drugs). During the preoperative evaluation, anesthesiologists should inquire about the use of herbal medications to anticipate potential adverse drug interactions during the perioperative period.",research

Abstract: Statin therapy has a very important role in decreasing cardiovascular risk, and treatment non-compliance may therefore be a concern in high cardiovascular risk patients. Myotoxicity is a frequent side effect of statin therapy and one of the main causes of statin discontinuation, which limits effective treatment of patients at risk of or with cardiovascular disease. Because of the high proportion of patients on statin treatment and the frequency of statin-related myotoxicity, this is a subject of concern in clinical practice. However, statin-related myotoxicity is probably underestimated because there is not a gold standard definition, and its diagnosis is challenging. Moreover, information about pathophysiology and optimal therapeutic options is scarce. Therefore, this paper reviews the knowledge about the definition, pathophysiology and predisposing conditions, diagnosis and management of statin-related myotoxicity, and provides a practical scheme for its management in clinical practice.",research

Abstract: Food supplements and herbal products are increasingly popular amongst consumers. This leads to increased risks of interactions between prescribed drugs and these products containing bioactive ingredients. From 1991 up to 2014, 55 cases of suspected adverse drug reactions due to concomitant intake of health-enhancing products and drugs were reported to Lareb, the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre. An overview of these suspected interactions is presented and their potential mechanisms of action are described. Mainly during the metabolism of xenobiotics and due to the pharmacodynamics effects interactions seem to occur, which may result in adverse drug reactions. Where legislation is seen to distinct food and medicine, legislation concerning these different bioactive products is less clear-cut. This can only be resolved by increasing the molecular knowledge on bioactive substances and their potential interactions. Thereby potential interactions can be better understood and prevented on an individual level. By considering the dietary pattern and use of bioactive substances with prescribed medication, both health professionals and consumers will be increasingly aware of interactions and these interactive adverse effects can be prevented.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Multiple-micronutrient (MMN) deficiencies often coexist among women of reproductive age in low- and middle-income countries. They are exacerbated in pregnancy due to the increased demands of the developing fetus, leading to potentially adverse effects on the mother and baby. A consensus is yet to be reached regarding the replacement of iron and folic acid supplementation with MMNs. Since the last update of this Cochrane Review in 2017, evidence from several trials has become available. The findings of this review will be critical to inform policy on micronutrient supplementation in pregnancy. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits of oral multiple-micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy on maternal, fetal and infant health outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: For this 2018 update, on 23 February 2018 we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and reference lists of retrieved studies. We also contacted experts in the field for additional and ongoing trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: All prospective randomised controlled trials evaluating MMN supplementation with iron and folic acid during pregnancy and its effects on pregnancy outcomes were eligible, irrespective of language or the publication status of the trials. We included cluster-randomised trials, but excluded quasi-randomised trials. Trial reports that were published as abstracts were eligible.

Of these 20 trials, 19 were conducted in low- and middle-income countries and compared MMN supplements with iron and folic acid to iron, with or without folic acid. One trial conducted in the UK compared MMN supplementation with placebo. In total, eight trials were cluster-randomised.MMN with iron and folic acid versus iron, with or without folic acid (19 trials)MMN supplementation probably led to a slight reduction in preterm births (average risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.01; 18 trials, 91,425 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and babies considered small-for-gestational age (SGA) (average RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.97; 17 trials; 57,348 participants; moderate-quality evidence), though the CI for the pooled effect for preterm births just crossed the line of no effect.

Authors: Russel J Reiter, Luiz Gustavo De Almeida Chuffa, Vinícius Augusto Simão et al. Published: Dec 2024

Abstract: Significant advancements have been made in cancer therapy; however, limitations remain with some conventional approaches. Adjuvants are agents used alongside primary treatments to enhance their efficacy and the treatment outcomes of patients. Modern lifestyles contribute to deficiencies in melatonin and vitamin D. Limited sun exposure affects vitamin D synthesis, and artificial light at night suppresses melatonin production. Both melatonin and vitamin D possess anti‑inflammatory, immune‑boosting and anticancer properties, rendering them potential adjuvants of interest. Studies suggest melatonin and vitamin D supplementation may address antioxidant imbalances in lip, oral and pharyngeal cancers. Moreover, promising results from breast, head and neck, brain, and osteosarcoma research indicate potential for tumor growth inhibition, improved survival, and a better quality of life of patients with cancer. The radioprotective properties of melatonin and vitamin D are another exciting area of exploration, potentially enhancing radiotherapy effectiveness while reducing side effects. For its part, the sleep‑promoting effects of melatonin may indirectly benefit patients with cancer by influencing the immune system. Thus, the prevalence of vitamin D and melatonin deficiencies highlights the importance of supplementation, as lower levels can worsen side‑effects from cancer treatments. The present review explores the potential of combining melatonin and vitamin D as synergistic adjuvants for cancer therapy. These agents have shown promise individually in cancer prevention and treatment, and their combined effects warrant investigation.",research

Abstract: This study explores the potential use of ChatGPT, an AI-based language model, in assessing herbal-drug interactions (HDi) to enhance clinical decision-making. HDi can pose significant health risks by reducing drug efficacy or causing unwanted side effects. Clinical pharmacists play a key role in identifying these HDIs, and currently, there are limited tools available for checking drug interactions. The research focuses on a case study of a rectal adenocarcinoma patient treated with capecitabine and 26 supplements, which contain a total of 80 herbal substances. ChatGPT 3.5 was asked three questions regarding potential HDIs: ""Are there possible HDIs?"", ""What is the pharmacokinetic mechanism?"", and ""What is the bibliographic source of the interaction?"". The results were reviewed by an oncology clinical pharmacist and compared to existing databases and independent bibliographic research. The findings highlight ChatGPT's advantage in processing large amounts of data quickly, with 16% of interactions classified as ""unlikely"", confirmed by the pharmacist. However, 73% of the suggested mechanisms were false positives, and 4% were categorized as ""hallucinations"". Additionally, most of the bibliographic sources provided by ChatGPT were outdated or unavailable. While ChatGPT proves useful for initial HDI screening, its limitations include outdated data (last updated in January 2022), lack of access to private databases, and occasional inaccuracies. Further applications of AI in this area are recommended, though expert validation remains essential in the clinical decision-making process.",research

Abstract: By the turn of the twenty-first century, the use of nutraceuticals became increasingly popular in both humans and animals due to their easy access, cost-effectiveness, and tolerability with a wide margin of safety. While some nutraceuticals are safe, others have a toxic potential. For a large number of nutraceuticals, no toxicity/safety data are available due to a lack of pharmacological/toxicological studies. The safety of some nutraceuticals can be compromised via contamination with toxic plants, metals, mycotoxins, pesticides, fertilizers, drugs of abuse, etc. Knowledge of pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic studies appears to play a pivotal role in safety and toxicity assessment of nutraceuticals. Interaction studies are essential to determine efficacy, safety, and toxicity when nutraceuticals and therapeutic drugs are used concomitantly. This chapter describes various aspects of nutraceuticals, particularly their toxic potential, and the factors influencing their safety.",research

Published: 2019

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Vitamin D and magnesium (Mg) are some of the most studied topics in medicine with enormous implications for human health and disease. Majority of the adults are deficient in both vitamin D and magnesium but continue to go unrecognized by many health care professionals. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: Mg and vitamin D are used by all the organs in the body, and their deficiency states may lead to several chronic medical conditions. Studies described in the literature regarding these disease associations are contradictory, and reversal of any of these conditions may not occur for several years after adequate replacement. One should consider the supplementation therapy to be preventative rather than curative at this time. DATA SOURCES: PubMed search of several reported associations between vitamin D and Mg with diseases. RESULTS: Vitamin D and Mg replacement therapy in elderly patients is known to reduce the nonvertebral fractures, overall mortality, and the incidence of Alzheimer dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D screening assay is readily available, but the reported lower limit of the normal range is totally inadequate for disease prevention. Based on the epidemiologic studies, ∼75% of all adults worldwide have serum 25(OH)D levels of <30 ng/mL. Because of the recent increase in global awareness, vitamin D supplementation has become a common practice, but Mg deficiency still remains unaddressed. Screening for chronic magnesium deficiency is difficult because a normal serum level may still be associated with moderate to severe deficiency. To date, there is no simple and accurate laboratory test to determine the total body magnesium status in humans. Mg is essential in the metabolism of vitamin D, and taking large doses of vitamin D can induce severe depletion of Mg.",research

Published: Jul 2017

Abstract: The most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulants worldwide are the vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin. Factors affecting the pharmacokinetics of VKAs are important because deviations from their narrow therapeutic window can result in bleedings due to over-anticoagulation or thrombosis because of under-anticoagulation. In addition to pharmacodynamic interactions (e.g., augmented bleeding risk for concomitant use of NSAIDs), interactions with drugs, foods, herbs, and over-the-counter medications may affect the risk/benefit ratio of VKAs. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) including Factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) and thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) are poised to replace warfarin. Phase-3 studies and real-world evaluations have established that the safety profile of DOACs is superior to those of VKAs. However, some pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions are expected. Herein we present a critical review of VKAs and DOACs with focus on their potential for interactions with drugs, foods, herbs and over-the-counter medications.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This review provides a summary of the currently available clinical data on drug-drug interactions (DDIs) involving over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. It aims to educate and increase awareness among health care providers and to support decisions in daily practice. METHODS: An extensive literature search was performed using bibliographic databases available through PubMed.gov. An initial structured search was performed using the keywords ""drug-drug-interaction AND (over-the-counter OR OTC),"" without further restrictions except for the language. The initial results were screened for all described DDIs involving OTC drugs, and further information was gathered specifically on these drugs using dedicated database searches and references found in the bibliography from the initial hits. RESULTS: From more than 1200 initial hits (1972-June 2021), 408 relevant publications were screened for DDIs involving OTC drugs, leading to 2 major findings: first, certain types of drug regimens are more prone to DDIs or have more serious DDI-related consequences, such as antiretroviral, anti-infective, and oral anticancer therapies. Second, although most DDIs involve OTC drugs as the perpetrators, some prescription drugs (statins or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors) that currently have OTC status can be identified as the victims in DDIs. The following groups were identified to be frequently involved in DDIs: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, food supplements, antacids, proton-pump inhibitors, H2 antihistamines, laxatives, antidiarrheal drugs, and herbal drugs. CONCLUSIONS: The most significant finding was the lack of high-quality evidence for commonly acknowledged interactions. High-quality interaction studies involving different phenotypes in drug metabolism (cytochrome P450) and distribution (transporters) are urgently needed.",research

Abstract: Use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) and over-the-counter (OTC) medications are very common among HIV-infected patients. These products can cause clinically significant drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with antiretroviral (ARV) medications, thereby increasing risk for negative outcomes such as toxicity or loss of virologic control. Areas covered: This article provides an updated review of the different mechanisms by which CAM and OTC products are implicated in DDIs with ARV medications. Expert commentary: Much of the literature published to date involves studies of CAMs interacting with older ARV agents via the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system. However, the HIV treatment and prevention arsenal is continually evolving. Furthermore, our elucidation of the role of non-CYP450 mediated DDIs with ARV medications is greatly increasing. Therefore, clinicians are well served to understand the various mechanisms and extent by which new ARV therapies may be involved in drug interactions with CAMs and OTC medications.",research

Abstract: Consumption of plant-derived natural products and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs is increasing on a global scale, and studies of phytochemical-OTC drug interactions are becoming more significant. The intake of dietary plants and herbs rich in phytochemicals may affect drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) and transporters. These effects may lead to alterations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of OTC drugs when concomitantly administered. Some phytochemical-drug interactions benefit patients through enhanced efficacy, but many interactions cause adverse effects. This review discusses possible mechanisms of phytochemical-OTC drug interactions mediated by phase I and II DMEs and phase III transporters. In addition, current information is summarized for interactions between phytochemicals derived from fruits, vegetables, and herbs and OTC drugs, and counseling is provided on appropriate and safe use of OTC drugs.",research

Abstract: Oncology patients undergoing radiation treatment and chemotherapy routinely use prescription and/or over-the counter medications either as part of pre-existing comorbid conditions or in the context of conventional treatment management. A growing amount of data suggest that commonly used pharmaceuticals possess antioxidant properties, which may also partially explain some of their therapeutic efficacy. Clinical research is continuing on how such agents interact during chemotherapy and radiation when oxidative mechanisms of action are involved. Historically, such discussions centered on the category of dietary supplements, natural health products, fruits and vegetables, along with established protectant medications. Evidence confirms that some pharmaceutical agents exhibit antioxidant properties similar to dietary supplements, protectants, and may hence hinder the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Awareness by both healthcare providers and patients in this area is often lacking. After reviewing some of the more common and well-established pharmaceuticals, which include those prescribed during cancer treatment, caution needs to be advised especially in regards to the use of corticosteroids, as long-term randomized outcome studies ensuring safety in this area are still outstanding.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as apixaban, are the most commonly prescribed anticoagulants, with advantages in that they do not require routine monitoring. However, less frequent contact with healthcare professionals may contribute to poor patient knowledge about potential interactions between over-the-counter (OTC) products and DOACs. OBJECTIVE: Determine the prevalence of use of OTC products (OTC medications and dietary supplements) with potentially serious apixaban interactions and assess patient knowledge of potential interactions. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Academic-affiliated outpatient medical practices in northern and southern California. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 791 English- or Spanish-speaking patients prescribed apixaban. MEASUREMENTS: Use and knowledge of OTC medications and dietary supplements with potentially serious apixaban interactions. RESULTS: Almost all respondents (n = 771; 97.5%) reported OTC product use. Of respondents, 33% (n = 266) took at least one OTC product with potentially serious apixaban interactions daily/most days and 53 (6.7%) took multiple products (mean = 2.6 [SD = 2.6]). Aspirin was taken daily by 116 (14.7%; of which 75 [64.7%] also consumed other potentially interacting OTC products), and some days/as needed by an additional 82 (10.4%).

Abstract: Over-the-counter (OTC) products such as pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, vitamins, and herbal remedies are widely available and copiously used by older adults for health maintenance and symptom management. Owing to physiology, multimorbidity, and polypharmacy, this population is particularly vulnerable to inappropriate use of OTC products, adverse effects, and drug interactions. While OTC pharmaceuticals are bound by FDA-approved standards, dietary supplements are regulated differently, resulting in variable quality and increased possibility for adulteration. Internationally, standards for OTC products vary widely. Accessible educational information, improved provider-patient communication, and revision of regulatory policy could improve safety for older adult users of OTC products.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Heartburn and other symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux occur in ~30% of survey respondents in multiple countries worldwide. Heartburn and acid regurgitation are common complaints in the pharmacy, where patients frequently seek relief through medication and advice. The growing number of proton-pump inhibitors available in the over-the-counter setting provides an efficacious choice to patients experiencing frequent heartburn. Pharmacists can assist patients in their treatment decisions whilst inquiring about alarm symptoms that should prompt a physician referral. Aim of the review Provide pharmacists with a review of current clinical research and expert guidelines on use of over-the-counter proton-pump inhibitors. METHODS: This narrative review was conducted to identify publications relevant to the following themes: overview of available treatments for frequent episodes of heartburn/acid regurgitation; treatment algorithms providing guidance on when to use over-the-counter proton-pump inhibitors; and the role of the pharmacist in the use of over-the-counter proton-pump inhibitors. RESULTS: Frequent symptoms of acid reflux, such as heartburn and acid regurgitation, can interfere substantially with daily life activities. Proton-pump inhibitors are the most efficacious treatment for frequent reflux symptoms and are recommended as an appropriate initial treatment in uncomplicated cases. Proton-pump inhibitors have varying pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics across the class; 20 mg esomeprazole has higher bioavailability and exposure than over-the-counter omeprazole, for example. However, differences in clinical efficacy for symptom relief have not been demonstrated.",research

Objective To determine the number and nature of drug-related problems in over-the-counter medication with a special emphasis on high-risk over-the-counter medications. Setting Fifty-two community pharmacies in Finland. Method This observational study was conducted as a questionnaire survey. The pharmacists working in participating pharmacies documented the observed drug-related problems and pharmacy interventions in over-the-counter medication during 1 week using an electronic study form based on the Westerlund drug-related problem classification system. Main outcome measure The prevalence of drug-related problems and problem types in different medication categories. Results The 52 community pharmacies documented 339 drug-related problems in 0.6% of over-the-counter customers, the most common problem being ""Uncertainty about the indication for the drug"" (39.2%). A significant proportion of the documented problems (26.3%) concerned high-risk over-the-counter medications, and the majority of these cases were associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (21.8%). In total, pharmacies made 641 interventions to resolve the drug-related problems. For majority of drug-related problems (87%), pharmacist's intervention involved counselling. In more than half of the problem cases, the pharmacy intervention was precautionary.",research

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to provide an overview of common drug-drug interactions (DDIs) associated with prostate cancer treatments and outline recommendations for managing polypharmacy. DATA SOURCES: A literature search of PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL was carried out to identify pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes caused by DDIs that are relevant for prostate cancer patients, DDIs between prostate cancer therapies and co-administered medications (both prescription and over-the-counter), and measures to prevent DDIs. Medication package inserts were used to identify the impact of DDI on the prostate cancer therapy and suggested interventions. DATA SUMMARY: No DDIs are expected for the LHRH agonists leuprolide acetate, histrelin, goserelin, or leuprolide mesylate. However, DDIs have been reported for GnRH antagonists, anti-androgens, PARP inhibitors, and taxanes. Although there are no confirmed DDIs for sipuleucel-T to date, it is not generally recommended to use sipuleucel-T concurrently with immunosuppressive medications. Interventions to prevent DDIs include the use of software that can detect clinically significant DDIs, up-to-date medication reconciliation, the inclusion of dedicated clinical pharmacists in cancer treatment teams, and patient/caregiver education. CONCLUSIONS: Prostate cancer patients have a high risk of potential DDIs due to numerous new anti-cancer therapies, the increased use of treatment combinations, and the likelihood of comorbid conditions also requiring drug therapy. Drug-drug interaction screening software, up-to-date medication reconciliation, inclusion of oncology pharmacists on healthcare teams, and patient/caregiver education will aid the development of treatment plans that focus on achieving an optimal risk-benefit profile whilst reducing the risk of DDIs.",research

Abstract: Ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced photoageing of the skin is associated with characteristic clinical features including a sallow complexion, deep, coarse wrinkles and a loss of elasticity. Remodelling of the dermal extracellular matrix (ECM) with changes to fibrillar collagens, elastic fibres and glycosaminoglycans is likely to be a major contributing factor to these particular clinical signs. Over-the-counter (OTC) topical formulations are one popular management strategy for preventing and/or repairing photoaged skin, most commonly targeting wrinkles as these are often the most concerning clinical feature. Due to the cosmetic nature of such formulations, evidence of their clinical efficacy and mechanism of action is often limited. However, these formulations usually contain putative active ingredients which individually have been subject to in vitro and in vivo investigation for efficacy as photoageing interventions. This review highlights commonly found ingredients within OTC formulations and assesses the evidence for: (i) their efficacy in clinically and histologically improving photoaged skin; (ii) the potential mechanisms of action; and (iii) their ability to act synergistically with complementary ingredients to enhance the clinical outcome.",research

Published: Dec 2017

Abstract: The number of older HIV-infected people is growing due to increasing life expectancies resulting from the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Both HIV and aging increase the risk of other comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and some malignancies, leading to greater challenges in managing HIV with other conditions. This results in complex medication regimens with the potential for significant drug-drug interactions and increased morbidity and mortality. Area covered: We review the metabolic pathways of ART and other medications used to treat medical co-morbidities, highlight potential areas of concern for drug-drug interactions, and where feasible, suggest alternative approaches for treating these conditions as suggested from national guidelines or articles published in the English language. Expert commentary: There is limited evidence-based data on ART drug interactions, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the older HIV-infected population. Choosing and maintaining effective ART regimens for older adults requires consideration of side effect profile, individual comorbidities, interactions with concurrent prescriptions and non-prescription medications and supplements, dietary patterns with respect to dosing, pill burden and ease of dosing, cost and affordability, patient preferences, social situation, and ART resistance history. Practitioners must remain vigilant for potential drug interactions and intervene when there is a potential for harm.",research

Published: Dec 2019

Abstract: Clinically relevant adverse drug reactions differ between men and women. The underlying physiological and pharmacological processes contributing to these differences are infrequently studied or reported. As gene expression, cellular regulatory pathways, and integrated physiological functions differ between females and males, aggregating data from combined groups of men and women obscures the ability to detect these differences. This paper summarizes how genetic sex, that is, the presence of sex chromosomes XY for male or XX for female, and the influence of sex hormones affect transporters, receptors, and enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Changing levels of sex steroids throughout life, including increases at puberty, changes with pregnancy, and decreases with age, may directly and indirectly affect drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination. The direct and indirect effects of sex steroids in the form of exogenous hormones such as those used in hormonal contraceptives, menopausal hormone treatments, transgender therapy, and over-the-counter performance enhancing drugs may interfere with metabolism of other pharmaceuticals, and these interactions may vary by dose, formulation, and mode of delivery (oral, injection, or transdermal) of the steroid hormones. Few drugs have sex-specific labeling or dosing recommendations. Furthermore, there is limited literature evaluating how the circulating levels of sex steroids impact drug efficacy or adverse reactions. Such research is needed in order to improve the understanding of the impact of sex hormones on pharmacological therapies, particularly as medicine moves toward individualizing treatments.",research

Abstract: Current demographic data clearly show that the North American population is aging, and projections suggest that the percentage of older people will increase. The elderly often suffer from multiple chronic conditions that affect their quality of life, use of health services, morbidity and mortality. Also, in those of advanced age, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many drugs are altered. Polypharmacy increases the incidence of adverse drug reactions and drug interactions in this population. Thus, the dentist must be continually aware of the pharmacologic status of each patient and consider the likelihood of interactions between drugs prescribed by the dentist, drugs prescribed by the physician and drugs that are self-administered, including over-the-counter medications and natural supplements. In this article, we discuss pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes in the elderly patient, polypharmacy and the changes in prescribing for our dental patients. Specific emphasis is placed on the drugs commonly prescribed by dentists: local anesthetics, analgesics and antibiotics.",research

Published: Sep 2015

Abstract: Although drugs can be an essential and lifesaving component of the care of adult patients, their use frequently is accompanied by adverse effects and life-threatening adverse drug reactions that can result in significant disability and mortality. The potential for drug-related severe morbidity and mortality is compounded during periods of hospitalization, when high-risk drugs such as anticoagulants or insulin are used, and when care in an intensive care unit is required. Patient factors in adults that can increase the risk of drug harms include immunosuppression, cognitive impairment, depression, alcoholism and other substance abuse disorders, chronic kidney disease, hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathies, limited English proficiency, institutional/nursing home care, and underinsurance or lack of insurance. Physician factors that can increase the risk of drug harms include inappropriate prescribing of drugs (including to pregnant and breastfeeding women), failure to appropriately discontinue/deprescribe drugs, insufficient drug reconciliation, failure to coordinate care among multiple prescribing clinicians, and failure to elicit and incorporate into health histories and clinical decision-making the widespread use of nonprescription drugs, herbal products, and dietary supplements.",research

Abstract: University students experience high prevalence of mental health problems and exacerbation of mental health difficulties, including sleep disturbances and stress during their studies. Stress and poor sleep quality and/or insomnia are interlinked outcomes for this population. The aim was to conduct a systematic review, and meta-analyses, of the relationships between sleep quality and/or insomnia with stress in students. Full-text articles of studies exploring the associations of stress with poor sleep quality and/or insomnia in undergraduate students using validated tools and published in peer-reviewed journals were eligible for inclusion. Thirty-four studies, resulting in 37 effect sizes, included and all were suitable for meta-analysis. The weighted pooled effect size between sleep quality and stress was for 0.39 (25 studies, n = 10,065), whereas a slightly higher pooled association of 0.41 was demonstrated for insomnia and stress (12 studies, n = 5564.5). Pooled associations show moderate effects for associations between sleep quality, insomnia and stress in undergraduate students. High heterogeneity in meta-analyses was found, suggesting the findings should be considered cautiously. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies exploring sleep difficulties across the academic year, whilst university services should consider psychoeducation for stress and sleep in university students, especially during transition to university.",research

Abstract: Patients with insomnia frequently use acupuncture as an alternative treatment to pharmacotherapy globally. The aim of this paper is to assess the effect of acupuncture on insomnia. Seven medical databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CNKI, RISS, NDSL, and OASIS, were used to identify studies published through July 09, 2020. Twenty-four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this qualitative review comparing acupuncture to either pharmacotherapy or sham-acupuncture therapy. Methodological quality was assessed, using the Cochrane risk of bias (ROB). In the subsequent quantitative meta-analysis of studies comparing acupuncture versus pharmacotherapy, fifteen RCTs demonstrated that acupuncture had a significant effect on patients with insomnia as assessed by the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) (RR: -0.74; 95% CI: -1.07 to -0.40; [Formula: see text] ¡0.0001; [Formula: see text] = 89%; [Formula: see text] = 1475). A subgroup analysis showed that there was no significant effect after weeks 1 and 2, but six studies found that acupuncture had a significant effect insomnia at week 3 (RR: -0.97; 95% CI: -1.65 to -0.28; [Formula: see text] = 0.006; [Formula: see text] = 91%; [Formula: see text] = 463) and nine studies demonstrated a significant effect at week 4 (RR: -0.70; 95% CI: -1.15 to -0.25; [Formula: see text] = 0.002; [Formula: see text] = 85%; [Formula: see text] = 594).

Abstract: Insomnia is one of the most common and burdensome disorders in adults. We compared and ranked insomnia medication on the basis of their efficacy and tolerability. We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis of placebo-controlled or head-to-head randomized controlled trials for primary insomnia in adults comparing 20 drugs. We searched eight databases and seven trial registers from inception to March 1st, 2022. Primary outcomes included sleep latency (SL), awake time after sleep onset (WASO) and discontinuation for adverse events (AED), and secondary outcomes included total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), sleep quality (SQ) and adverse events (ADE). Pooled standardized mean differences or odds ratios with 95% credible intervals were estimated using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random-effects. Differences among trial findings were explored in subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Confidence in evidence was assessed using GRADE. The PROSPERO registered number is CRD42020182144. We identified 22,538 records and included 69 studies (17,319 patients). Orexin receptor antagonists (ORAs) are more efficacious than benzodiazepine-like drugs (Z-drugs) and placebo for WASO and SE, and better than melatonin receptor agonists (MRAs) for SL, WASO and SE. ORAs ranked the best in SL (SUCRA value: 0.84), WASO (0.93), TST (0.86) and SE (0.96). Lemborexant and daridorexant (two ORAs) showed greater efficacy than placebo for SL, WASO, and TST, with good tolerability. Z-drugs were more efficacious than placebo for SL, WASO, TST and SE, but with higher risk to safety. Zaleplon and eszopiclone had better efficacy than placebo for TST and SQ respectively. MRAs may also be efficacious for sleep-onset insomnia with good safety.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In order to appraise the risk-benefit balance of the three available dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs; daridorexant, lemborexant, and suvorexant) for the management of adults with insomnia, we conducted a systematic review and random-effects model network meta-analysis. METHODS: Included were all published double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of these agents. Outcomes included subjective time to sleep onset at month 1 (sTSO, primary), subjective total sleep time at month 1 (sTST, co-primary), subjective wake after sleep onset at month 1, Insomnia Severity Index scores at month 1, all-cause discontinuation, discontinuation due to adverse events, and the incidence of individual adverse events such as somnolence, dizziness, falls, headache, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infection. RESULTS: This meta-analysis included eight trials (5198 adults, average age = 56.33 years, 67.84% female). The treatment arms included daridorexant 25 mg/day (DAR25), daridorexant 50 mg/day (DAR50), lemborexant 5 mg/day (LEM5), lemborexant 10 mg/day (LEM10), suvorexant 20 mg/day (15 mg/day for people ≥65years, SUV20/15), and placebo. All active-treatments outperformed placebo in terms of all efficacy outcomes.

Abstract: Almost 70% of patients with mental disorders report sleep difficulties and 30% fulfill the criteria for insomnia disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the first-line treatment for insomnia according to current treatment guidelines. Despite this circumstance, insomnia is frequently treated only pharmacologically especially in patients with mental disorders. The aim of the present meta-analysis was to quantify the effects of CBT-I in patients with mental disorders and comorbid insomnia on two outcome parameters: the severity of insomnia and mental health. The databases PubMed, CINHAL (Ebsco) und PsycINFO (Ovid) were searched for randomized controlled trials on adult patients with comorbid insomnia and any mental disorder comparing CBT-I to placebo, waitlist or treatment as usual using self-rating questionnaires as outcomes for either insomnia or mental health or both. The search resulted in 1994 records after duplicate removal of which 22 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included for the meta-analysis. The comorbidities were depression (eight studies, 491 patients), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD, four studies, 216 patients), alcohol dependency (three studies, 79 patients), bipolar disorder (one study, 58 patients), psychosis (one study, 50 patients) and mixed comorbidities within one study (five studies, 189 patients). The effect sizes for the reduction of insomnia severity post treatment were 0.5 (confidence interval, CI, 0.3-0.8) for patients with depression, 1.5 (CI 1.0-1.9) for patients with PTSD, 1.4 (CI 0.9-1.9) for patients with alcohol dependency, 1.2 (CI 0.8-1.7) for patients with psychosis/bipolar disorder, and 0.8 (CI 0.1-1.6) for patients with mixed comorbidities.",research

There were no significant effects on comorbid symptoms at follow-up. Together, these significant, stable medium to large effects indicate that CBT-I is an effective treatment for patients with insomnia and a comorbid mental disorder, especially depression, PTSD and alcohol dependency. CBT-I is also an effective add-on treatment with the aim of improving mental health in patients with depression, PTSD, and symptom severity in outpatients with mixed diagnoses. Thus, in patients with mental disorders and comorbid insomnia, given the many side effects of medication, CBT-I should be considered as a first-line treatment.",research

Abstract: In the management of insomnia, physicians and patients are seeking alternative therapeutics to sleeping pills, in addition to sleep hygiene and cognitive behavioural therapy. Bright light therapy (LT) has proven its efficacy in circadian and mood disorders. We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis according to Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines and using the databases Medline, Cochrane, and Web of Science, with a special focus on light therapy and insomnia. Twenty-two studies with a total of 685 participants were included, five of which with a high level of proof. Meta-analysis was performed with 13 of them: light therapy for insomnia compared with control conditions significantly improved wake after sleep onset (WASO: SMD = -0.61 [-1.11, -0.11]; p = 0.017; weighted difference of 11.2 min ±11.5 based on actigraphy, and SMD = -1.09 [-1.43, -0.74] (p < 0.001) weighted difference of -36.4 min ±15.05) based on sleep diary, but no other sleep measures such as sleep latency, total sleep time (TST), or sleep efficiency. Qualitative analysis of the review showed some improvement mainly in subjective measures. Morning light exposure advanced sleep-wake rhythms and evening exposure led to a delay. No worsening was observed in objective nor subjective measures, except for TST in one study with evening exposure. A light dose-response may exist but the studies' heterogeneity and publication bias limit the interpretation. To conclude, light therapy shows some effectiveness for sleep maintenance in insomnia disorders, but further research is needed to refine the light parameters to be chosen according to the type of insomnia, in the hope of developing personalised therapeutics.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Menopause is the time that marks passing 12 months after the last menstruation cycle in women between ages 40-50. Menopausal women often experience depression and insomnia that significantly impact their overall well-being and quality of life. This systematic review aims to determine the effects of different therapeutic physiotherapy modalities on insomnia and depression in perimenopausal, menopausal, and post-menopausal women. METHODOLOGY: After identifying our inclusion/exclusion criteria, we conducted a database search in Ovid Embase, MIDRIS, PubMed, Cochrane, and ScienceOpen, where 4007 papers were identified. By using EndNote software, we excluded duplicates, unrelated, and non-full text papers. Adding more studies from manual search, we finally included 31 papers including 7 physiotherapy modalities: exercise, reflexology, footbath, walking, therapeutic and aromatherapy massage, craniofacial message, and yoga. RESULTS: Reflexology, yoga, walking and aromatherapy massage showed an overall significant impact on decreasing insomnia and depression in menopausal women. Most of exercise and stretching interventions also showed improvement in sleep quality but inconsistent findings regarding depression. However, insufficient evidence was found regarding the effect of craniofacial massage, footbath, and acupressure on improving sleep quality and depression in menopausal women. CONCLUSION: Using non-pharmaceutical interventions such as therapeutic and manual physiotherapy have an overall positive impact on reducing insomnia and depression in menopausal women.",research

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this systematic review is to provide supporting evidence for a clinical practice guideline on the use of behavioral and psychological treatments for chronic insomnia disorder in adult populations. METHODS: The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of 9 experts in sleep medicine and sleep psychology. A systematic review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials that addressed behavioral and psychological interventions for the treatment of chronic insomnia disorder in adults. Statistical analyses were performed to determine if the treatments produced clinically significant improvements in a range of critical and important outcomes. Finally, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process was used to evaluate the evidence for making specific treatment recommendations. RESULTS: The literature search identified 1,244 studies; 124 studies met the inclusion criteria, and 89 studies provided data suitable for statistical analyses. Evidence for the following interventions is presented in this review: cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, brief therapies for insomnia, stimulus control, sleep restriction therapy, relaxation training, sleep hygiene, biofeedback, paradoxical intention, intensive sleep retraining, and mindfulness. This review provides a detailed summary of the evidence along with the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits vs harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations.",research

Abstract: Problems with sleep are reported to be common after stroke but the incidence and prevalence of insomnia and insomnia symptoms following stroke is not yet established. The aim of this review was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the incidence and prevalence of insomnia and insomnia symptoms in individuals affected by stroke. We searched seven main electronic databases to identify studies until September 25, 2018. No studies examining incidence of post-stroke insomnia were identified. Twenty-two studies on prevalence of insomnia or insomnia symptoms including individuals with stroke were included with fourteen studies suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis indicated pooled prevalence of 38.2% (CI 30.1-46.5) with significantly higher prevalence estimates for studies using non-diagnostic tools, 40.70% (CI 30.96-50.82) compared to studies using diagnostic assessment tools 32.21% (CI 18.5-47.64). Greater insomnia symptoms were indicated in those with comorbid depression and anxiety. The prevalence of both insomnia and insomnia symptoms are considerably higher in stroke survivors compared to the general population. Studies investigating the incidence, insomnia symptom profile and changes in insomnia prevalence over time are needed to inform clinical practice and to encourage tailored interventions that consider this symptomatology.

Published: Apr 2021

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Magnesium supplementation is often purported to improve sleep; however, as both an over-the-counter sleep aid and a complementary and alternative medicine, there is limited evidence to support this assertion. The aim was to assess the effectiveness and safety of magnesium supplementation for older adults with insomnia. METHODS: A search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine, clinicaltrials.gov and two grey literature databases comparing magnesium supplementation to placebo or no treatment. Outcomes were sleep quality, quantity, and adverse events. Risk of bias and quality of evidence assessments were carried out using the RoB 2.0 and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approaches. Data was pooled and treatment effects were quantified using mean differences. For remaining outcomes, a modified effects direction plot was used for data synthesis. RESULTS: Three randomized control trials (RCT) were identified comparing oral magnesium to placebo in 151 older adults in three countries. Pooled analysis showed that post-intervention sleep onset latency time was 17.36 min less after magnesium supplementation compared to placebo (95% CI - 27.27 to - 7.44, p = 0.0006). Total sleep time improved by 16.06 min in the magnesium supplementation group but was statistically insignificant. All trials were at moderate-to-high risk of bias and outcomes were supported by low to very low quality of evidence. CONCLUSION: This review confirms that the quality of literature is substandard for physicians to make well-informed recommendations on usage of oral magnesium for older adults with insomnia.",research

Abstract: Insomnia is common, is associated with major adverse medical and mental health outcomes, has a negative impact on quality of life, and has significant economic consequences. However, little is known about the global insomnia burden. This systematic review estimated the global prevalence of insomnia in adults. PubMed and Embase were searched (terms ""insomnia,"" ""prevalence,"" and ""general population"") to identify relevant peer-reviewed studies (final search 2-3 Sep 2024). Included studies had the highest data quality and lowest risk of bias, and reported clinically relevant insomnia prevalence in the general population. Insomnia prevalence estimates were applied to United Nations (UN) population data using a country-specific study (if available) or the highest-quality study (if no country-specific study). Of 1651 potential records, 18 studies (262,582 participants) were included. Thirty-one of 237 UN/World Bank-recognized countries/territories had a suitable nation-specific adult insomnia prevalence estimate. 852,325,091 adults (95 % confidence interval 830,354,161-874,309,252) were estimated to have insomnia (global prevalence: 16.2 %) and 414,967,941 were estimated to have severe insomnia (7.9 %). Insomnia and severe insomnia were more prevalent in females versus males across all age groups. The high global prevalence of insomnia disorder reinforces the need for comprehensive public health and clinical sleep health initiatives worldwide. REGISTRATION: PROSPERO: CRD42024581410.",research

Abstract: We conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses to evaluate the efficacy of melatonin versus placebo or other hypnotic agents in improving sleep quality and quantity in patients with chronic insomnia. A literature search on Ovid-MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library was performed up to November 2020. Sleep onset latency, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep quality and quality of life were examined as outcomes. We identified 24 randomized controlled trials of chronic insomnia including four studies of patients with comorbid insomnia. All studies were compared with placebo. Due to heterogeneity, we conducted subgroup analyses by age group. In non-comorbid insomnia, melatonin was only significantly effective in sleep onset latency and total sleep time in children and adolescents. In adults group, melatonin was not significantly effective in improving sleep onset latency, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency. In comorbid insomnia, melatonin significantly improved sleep onset latency in all age groups, but there was only one study in adults group. In conclusion, melatonin did not appear to be effective in adults but might be effective in children and adolescents with chronic insomnia for both comorbid insomnia and non-comorbid insomnia.

Published: Oct 2021

Abstract: Insomnia disorder (ID) has become the second-most common mental disorder. Despite burgeoning evidence for increased high-frequency electroencephalography (EEG) activity and cortical hyperarousal in ID, the detailed spectral features of this disorder during wakefulness and different sleep stages remain unclear. Therefore, we adopted a meta-analytic approach to systematically assess existing evidence on EEG spectral features in ID. Hedges's g was calculated by 148 effect sizes from 24 studies involving 977 participants. Our results demonstrate that, throughout wakefulness and sleep, patients with ID exhibited increased beta band power, although such increases sometimes extended into neighboring frequency bands. Patients with ID also exhibited increased theta and gamma power during wakefulness, as well as increased alpha and sigma power during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In addition, ID was associated with decreased delta power and increased theta, alpha, and sigma power during NREM sleep. The EEG measures of absolute and relative power have similar sensitivity in detecting spectral features of ID during wakefulness and REM sleep; however, relative power appeared to be a more sensitive biomarker during NREM sleep. Our study is the first statistics-based review to quantify EEG power spectra across stages of sleep and wakefulness in patients with ID.",research

Published: Feb 2019

Abstract: Previous research has identified insomnia as a predictor for the onset of depression. The aim of this meta-analysis is to investigate whether insomnia also predicts the onset of other mental disorders. Longitudinal studies were eligible for inclusion if they investigated insomnia at baseline (including nighttime- and daytime-symptoms) as a predictor of the later onset of psychopathology within a follow-up time-frame of at least 12 mo. Thirteen primary studies were included. The results suggest that insomnia is a significant predictor for the onset of depression (10 studies, OR 2.83, CI 1.55-5.17), anxiety (six studies, OR 3.23, CI 1.52-6.85), alcohol abuse (two studies, OR 1.35, CI 1.08-1.67, and psychosis (one study, OR 1.28, CI 1.03-1.59). The overall risk of bias in the primary studies was moderate. This meta-analysis provides evidence that insomnia increases the risk for psychopathology. A future research agenda should include more prospective studies using established diagnostic criteria, assessing insomnia at baseline and including long-term follow-up intervals evaluating a wider range of mental disorders. In addition, prospective long-term interventional studies investigating the efficacy of insomnia treatment for the prevention of mental disorders are called for.",research

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Insomnia is a common sleep disorder. There are many clinical-intervention methods for treating this condition, but thus far, the most effective method has not been determined. METHODS: We conducted a network meta-analysis by including random evidence of insomnia improvement in people over 18 years old, without other physical diseases. From January 1, 1990 to June 15, 2022, we searched multiple electronic databases for randomized controlled trials of different insomnia-related, clinical-intervention methods. R software was used to analyze 10 indices, in order to evaluate the effect of sleep improvement. Primary outcomes comprised Pittsburgh sleep quality-index (PSQI) scores and insomnia severity-index (ISI) scores. RESULTS: Finally, 122 randomized controlled trials were included in our study. For the PSQI scores, we found the sequence of intervention measures by effect to be as follows: electroacupuncture, acupuncture, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), essential oils, herbal medicine, traditional Western medicine, Tai Chi and Baduanjin, music, supplements, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), and exercise. The results for ISI were similar to those for PSQI, but with slight differences. CONCLUSION: Our research results indicate that various measures have a certain effect on improving sleep, among which the effect of instruments is more prominent. The curative effect of placebo groups was better than that of blank control groups. There is essentially no statistical difference in detailed classification within the same intervention category.",research

Abstract: Despite the success of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and recent advances in pharmacotherapy, many patients with insomnia do not sufficiently respond to available treatments. This systematic review aims to present the state of science regarding the use of brain stimulation approaches in treating insomnia. To this end, we searched MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO from inception to 24 March 2023. We evaluated studies that compared conditions of active stimulation with a control condition or group. Outcome measures included standardized insomnia questionnaires and/or polysomnography in adults with a clinical diagnosis of insomnia. Our search identified 17 controlled trials that met inclusion criteria, and assessed a total of 967 participants using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial electric stimulation, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation or forehead cooling. No trials using other techniques such as deep brain stimulation, vestibular stimulation or auditory stimulation met the inclusion criteria. While several studies report improvements of subjective and objective sleep parameters for different repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial electric stimulation protocols, important methodological limitations and risk of bias limit their interpretability. A forehead cooling study found no significant group differences in the primary endpoints, but better sleep initiation in the active condition. Two transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation trials found no superiority of active stimulation for most outcome measures. Although modulating sleep through brain stimulation appears feasible, gaps in the prevailing models of sleep physiology and insomnia pathophysiology remain to be filled.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Anxiety conditions are debilitating and prevalent throughout the world. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an effective, acceptance-based behavioral therapy for anxiety. However, there are treatment barriers (eg, financial, geographical, and attitudinal), which prevent people from accessing it. To overcome these barriers, internet-delivered ACT (iACT) interventions have been developed in recent years. These interventions use websites to deliver ACT information and skill training exercises on the Web, either as pure self-help or with therapist guidance. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to examine the therapeutic impact of iACT on all anxiety conditions. METHODS: The EMBASE, MEDLINE, ProQuest Central, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched up to September 2018. The titles and abstracts of remaining records after deduplication were screened by 2 authors with a total of 36 full-text articles being retained for closer inspection next to eligibility criteria. Empirical studies of all designs, population types, and comparator groups were included if they appraised the impact of iACT treatment on any standardized measure of anxiety. Included studies were appraised on methodological quality and had their data extracted into a standardized coding sheet. Findings were then tabulated, and a narrative synthesis was performed because of the heterogeneity found between studies. RESULTS: A total of 20 studies met inclusion criteria. There were 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 9 uncontrolled pilot studies. Participants across all studies were adults.",research

A total of 18 studies reported significant anxiety reduction after iACT treatment. This was observed in studies that delivered iACT with (n=13) or without (n=5) therapist guidance. The average attrition rate across all included studies during the active iACT treatment phase was 19.19%. In the 13 studies that assessed treatment satisfaction, participants on average rated their iACT experience with above average to high treatment satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that iACT can be an efficacious and acceptable treatment for adults with GAD and general anxiety symptoms. More RCT studies are needed to corroborate these early iACT findings using empirical treatments in active control groups (eg, internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy). This would potentially validate the promising results found for SAD and IAD as well as address the full spectrum of anxiety disorders.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are used to guide decision-making, especially regarding complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies that are unfamiliar to orthodox healthcare providers. This systematic review aimed to critically review and summarise CAM recommendations associated with anxiety management included in the existing CPGs. METHODS: Seven databases, websites of six international guidelines developing institutions, and the  RESULTS: Ten CPGs were included, with reporting rates between 51.4 and 88.6%. Seven of these were of moderate to high methodological quality. Seventeen CAM modalities were implicated, involving phytotherapeutics, mind-body practice, art therapy, and homeopathy. Applied relaxation was included in 70% CPGs, which varied in degree of support for its use in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. There were few recommendations for other therapies/products. Light therapy was not recommended for use in generalised anxiety disorder, and  CONCLUSION: Available guidelines are limited in providing logically explained graded CAM recommendations for anxiety treatment and care. A lack of high-quality evidence and multidisciplinary consultation during the guideline development are two major reasons. High quality and reliable clinical evidence and the engagement of a range of interdisciplinary stakeholders are needed for future CPG development and updating.

Abstract: CONTEXT: Anxiety disorders have a far-reaching impact on society, with profound implications on both mental and physical health. In response, there is growing interest in manual therapy modalities, with emerging research suggesting their potential to alleviate related symptoms. OBJECTIVES: To establish a consensus regarding manual therapy modalities for addressing anxiety symptoms, a systematic review of current literature was conducted. METHODS: A literature search was conducted between May and August 2023, utilizing a systematic search on both PubMed and Google Scholar, adhering to the defined inclusion criteria. In addition, information was gathered utilizing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Both authors (KLW and TH) conducted the literature review. The inclusion criteria include articles written in English, peer-reviewed, anxiety conditions documented, and manual therapy delivered by a respectfully qualified professional. Manual therapy modalities include massage therapy, osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), foot reflexology, acupressure, manual therapy, healing touch, therapeutic touch, and gentle touch. After initial data collection, both researchers independently screened articles utilizing two metrics: a level of evidence (LOE) table and a screening criterion incorporating unique elements from the search process. The quality of the included articles was assessed utilizing Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Anxiety is common in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and is associated with an increased risk for adverse outcomes. There has been a relative paucity of studies concerning treatment of anxiety in patients with CHD. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review to organize and assess research into the treatment of anxiety in patients with CHD. METHODS: We searched CCTR/CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL for randomized clinical trials conducted before October 2016 that measured anxiety before and after an intervention for patients with CHD. RESULTS: A total of 475 articles were subjected to full text review, yielding 112 publications that met inclusion criteria plus an additional 7 studies from reference lists and published reviews, yielding 119 studies. Sample size, country of origin, study quality, and demographics varied widely among studies. Most studies were conducted with nonanxious patients. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were the most frequently used instruments to assess anxiety. Interventions included pharmacological, counseling, relaxation-based, educational, or ""alternative"" therapies. Forty (33% of total) studies reported that the interventions reduced anxiety; treatment efficacy varied by study and type of intervention. Elevated anxiety was an inclusion criterion in only 4 studies, with inconsistent results. CONCLUSION: Although there have been a number of randomized clinical trials of patients with CHD that assessed anxiety, in most cases anxiety was a secondary outcome, and only one-third found that symptoms of anxiety were reduced with treatment. Future studies need to target anxious patients and evaluate the effects of treatment on anxiety and relevant clinical endpoints.",research

Abstract: Anxiety disorders are disorders involving cognition. Research on cognition in youth with anxiety can focus on cognitive content (e.g., self-talk) as well cognitive functioning. The present review examines domains of cognitive functioning (i.e., episodic memory, language, attention, executive functioning, motor skills, and visual functioning) in youth diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. A database search of Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed yielded 28 studies that met inclusion criteria of youth aged 17 years or younger, a sample diagnosed with a principal anxiety disorder and a comparison sample of controls, a comparison between those samples, and use of a behavioral measure of neuropsychological performance. Findings did not identify any cognitive functioning strengths for anxious youth. Deficits were found in two domains (i.e., receptive language and motor skills) whereas no deficits were found in attention, visuospatial skills and one domain of executive functioning (i.e., inhibition). Most domains had mixed findings. Additional analysis indicated that anxiety disorders in youth are not associated with diminished IQ. Directions for future research are identified including (a) the prioritization of studies with larger, representative samples (b) the role of cognitive functioning as a predictor of anxiety treatment outcome (c) the examination of the effect of treatment on cognitive performance, and (d) the course of anxiety and potential impairment in cognitive functioning.",research

Published: Sep 2019

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Previous studies indicate that early symptomatic improvement, typically observed during the first 4 weeks of psychological therapy, is associated with positive treatment outcomes for a range of mental health problems. However, the replicability, statistical significance, and magnitude of this association remain unclear. AIM: The current study reviewed the literature on early response to psychological interventions for adults with depression and anxiety symptoms. METHODS: A systematic review and random effects meta-analysis were conducted, including studies found in Medline, PsychINFO, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and through reference lists and reverse citations. RESULTS: Twenty-five eligible studies including 11,091 patients measured early response and examined associations with posttreatment outcomes. It was possible to extract and/or calculate effect size data from 15 studies to conduct a meta-analysis. A large pooled effect size (g = 0.87 [95% confidence interval: 0.63-1.10], p < .0001) indicated that early responders had significantly better posttreatment outcomes compared to cases without early response, and this effect was larger in anxiety (g = 1.37) compared to depression (g = 0.76) measures. Most studies were of good quality and there was no evidence of publication bias. The main limitations concerned insufficient statistical reporting in some studies, which precluded their inclusion in meta-analysis, and it was not possible to examine effect sizes according to different outcome questionnaires. CONCLUSION: There is robust and replicated evidence that early response to therapy is a reliable prognostic indicator for depression and anxiety treatment outcomes.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and can affect disease outcomes, including quality of life and success of disease treatment. Successful management of psychiatric comorbidities may improve outcomes, though the effectiveness of existing treatments in IBD is unknown. METHODS: We searched multiple online databases from inception until March 25, 2015, without restrictions on language, date, or location of publication. We included controlled clinical trials conducted in persons with IBD and depression or anxiety. Two independent reviewers reviewed all abstracts and full-text articles and extracted information including trial and participant characteristics. We also assessed the risk of bias. RESULTS: Of 768 unique abstracts, we included one trial of pharmacological anxiety treatment in IBD (48 participants), which found an improvement in anxiety symptoms (p < 0.001). There was a high risk of bias in this trial. We found no controlled clinical trials on the treatment of depression in persons with IBD and depression and no controlled clinical trials reporting on psychological interventions for anxiety or depression in IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Only one trial examined an intervention for anxiety in adults with IBD and no trials studied depression in adults with IBD. The level of evidence is low because of the risk of bias and limited evidence.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM: Depression and anxiety can cause social, behavioral, occupational, and functional impairments if not controlled and managed. Mobile-based self-care applications can play an essential and effective role in controlling and reducing the effects of anxiety disorders and depression. The aim of this study was to design and develop a mobile-based self-care application for patients with depression and anxiety disorders with the goal of enhancing their mental health and overall well-being. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study we designed a mobile-based application for self -management of depression and anxiety disorders. In order to design this application, first the education- informational needs and capabilities were identified through a systematic review. Then, according to 20 patients with depression and anxiety, this education-informational needs and application capabilities were approved. In the next step, the application was designed. RESULTS: In the first step, 80 education-information needs and capabilities were identified. Finally, in the second step, of 80 education- informational needs and capabilities, 68 needs and capabilities with a mean greater than and equal to 3.75 (75%) were considered in application design. Disease control and management, drug management, nutrition and diet management, recording clinical records, communicating with physicians and other patients, reminding appointments, how to improve lifestyle, quitting smoking and reducing alcohol consumption, educational content, sedation instructions, introducing health care centers for depression and anxiety treatment and recording activities, personal goals and habits in a diary were the most important features of this application.",research

Animal and human research indicates adolescence as a sensitive period when the gut-brain axis is fine-tuned, where dietary interventions to change the microbiome may have long-lasting consequences for mental health. This study reports a systematic review and meta-analysis of microbiota-targeted (psychobiotics) interventions on anxiety in youth, with discussion of a consultation on the acceptability of psychobiotic interventions for mental health management amongst youth with lived experience. Six databases were searched for controlled trials in human samples (age range: 10-24 years) seeking to reduce anxiety. Post intervention outcomes were extracted as standard mean differences (SMDs) and pooled based on a random-effects model. 5416 studies were identified: 14 eligible for systematic review and 10 eligible for meta-analysis (total of 324 experimental and 293 control subjects).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is preliminary evidence for lavender as an anxiolytic agent through various routes of administration. Our goal is to elucidate the best route of administration for lavender as a treatment for anxiety. METHODS: Thirteen electronic search engines were systematically scanned for relevant publications. The relevant articles were included after the title and abstract screening followed by the full-text screening. This study included randomized control trials reporting lavender for the treatment of anxiety. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42017076711). Frequentist network meta-analysis and Bayesian meta-regression were conducted to report the best treatment modality and the effect of covariates on the effectiveness as an anxiolytic. Treatment arms were ordered according P-scores, where higher P-score indicates better treatment choice. RESULTS: Forty studies were eligible for qualitative analysis, and 32 were included in quantitative analysis. Lavender aromatherapy was the best approach for the treatment of anxiety among other lavender modalities at the first week recording [Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) = -0.57, 95% CI (-1.14-0.01), P-score = 0.72], in addition to achieve at the first time points [SMD = -0, 95% CI (-0.97 ̶ -0.16), P-score = 0.69], compared to placebo; however, lavender massage along with foot bath were found to be the most efficacious for anxiety treatment at the study endpoint [SMD = -1.10, 95% CI = (-7.41 ̶ 5.21), P-score = 0.65].

Abstract: Pre-injury anxiety disorder may be a risk factor for poor outcomes following sportsrelated concussion. A systematic review was performed to characterize the relationship between pre-injury anxiety disorder and post-concussion symptom presentation and recovery time after sports-related concussions among children, adolescents, and young adults. A PRISMA-compliant literature search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and Scopus for articles published up to 25 January 2024. The initial query yielded 1358 unique articles. Articles that analyzed the relationship between pre-injury anxiety disorder and post-concussion symptoms and recovery time were included. A final cohort of 11 articles was extracted, comprising a total of 8390 study participants, of whom 921 had a history of pre-injury anxiety disorder. Pre-injury anxiety disorder was associated with prolonged time to return to sports activity and an increased incidence of physical, emotional, cognitive, and sleep-related symptoms. While the results of this review suggest an association between pre-injury anxiety disorder and post-concussion symptoms and recovery time, future studies should be more stringent regarding standardized anxiety disorder definitions, longitudinal assessment of post-concussion symptoms, anxiety disorder subtypes, and anxiety treatment history.",research

Abstract: Mental health is a global public concern that contributes raising disability and premature death. Anxiety undertakes around 3.6% of the global population, while psychological stress is a condition associated to anxiety with a prevalence of 36.5%. Treatment for both mental conditions consist mainly of psychological therapy and pharmacotherapy, but the long-term drugs use can trigger adverse effects. Growing evidence shows the effect of specific food compounds on stress and anxiety treatment. The aim of this systematic review is to describe the molecular mechanisms related to dietary polyphenols administration from food matrix (considering food, juices or herbal/food extracts) and their effects on stress and/or anxiety, as well as review the available clinical evidence. Search was based on PRISMA Guidelines using peer-reviewed journal articles sourced from PubMed and Web of Science. A total of 38 articles were considered as eligible. The major effects for anxiety management were: reduction of oxidative stress and inflammation; HPA axis modulation; and regulation of some serotonergic/adrenergic pathways. There is a very limited evidence to conclude about the real effect of dietary polyphenols on stress. Although pharmacological treatment for mood disorders is essential, alternative therapies are necessary using non-pharmacological compounds to improve the long-term treatment effectiveness.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are the most common mental disorders worldwide. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to review silymarin and silibinin effects and underlying mechanisms in the central nervous system (CNS) for depression and anxiety treatment. METHODS: The research protocol was prepared based on following the PRISMA statement. An extensive search was done in essential databases such as PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science (ISI), Embase, and Scopus. Considering the study inclusion and exclusion criteria, 17 studies were finally included. The desired information was extracted from the studies and recorded in Excel, and the consequences and mechanisms were reviewed. RESULTS: Silymarin and silibinin upregulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and improved neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferation in the cortex and hippocampus. They also increased neurochemical serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE) levels. Silymarin and silibinin reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) formation and increased glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities. In addition, silymarin and silibinin reduced interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and IL-12β, reducing tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) induced neuroinflammation. CONCLUSION: Silymarin and silibinin exert anti-depression and anxiolytic effects by regulating neurotransmitters, endocrine, neurogenesis, and immunologic systems. Therefore, as natural and complementary medicines, they can be used to reduce the symptoms of depression and anxiety; However, more clinical studies are needed in this field.",research

Abstract: Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental health issues in childhood, yet most children do not receive treatment. With recent advances in technology, a growing number of digital anxiety interventions are becoming accessible. This study is the first meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of digital cognitive-behavioral anxiety interventions for individuals under the age of 18. Five electronic databases (PsycNET, Web of Science, Science Direct, Pub Med, SAGE Journals.) were systematically searched in 2021. Inclusion criteria were: randomized control trials with a wait list no treatment control, standalone to blended care with minimal therapist involvement, diagnosed anxiety disorder or elevated levels of anxiety, outcome anxiety levels had to be assessed by a clinician, or the patients themselves by a validated anxiety measure. We assessed and controlled for publication bias, and considered the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Eighteen studies were found eligible, which examined 1290 participants in total. Pooled effect sizes using a random-effects model yielded low overall effect for self-ratings (g = 0.28, k = 18, p < 0.001, 95% CI [0.14; 0.41]), and medium effect for ratings of clinicians (g = 0.66, k = 13, p < 0.001, 95% CI [0.50; 0.80]) as well as for parental report (g = 0.49, k = 16, p < 0.001, 95% CI [0.29; 0.69]). We found that the effects were homogenous across studies. Further examining potential moderating factors of treatment efficacy is needed in future research, as well as conducting studies that compare traditional methods of care to their digital counterparts.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study examined the extent to which social anxiety treatment studies report the demographic characteristics of their participants. One hundred and 56 treatment studies published in English between 2001 and 2012 articles were collected. METHODS: Each study was evaluated on whether or not it reported information on gender, age, race, relationship status, education, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, and disability and also the extent to which the racial composition of the sample was described. RESULTS: The majority of studies reported information on age (96.2%) and gender (94.2%), but the percentage of studies that reported anything else is much lower: race (50.0%), education (42.3%), relationship status (37.8%), socioeconomic status (5.1%), disability (2.6%), and sexual orientation (1.3%). One third (34.0%) of studies reported the race of all participants in their samples, while the remaining reported no information or information for only a subset of participants (e.g. ""mostly white""). CONCLUSIONS: Participants of social anxiety disorder treatment studies generally are not described beyond their age and gender. Standards for reporting participant characteristics of treatment studies (similar to standards for reporting the methodology of treatment studies) could improve clinical researchers' and clinicians' ability to evaluate the external validity of this body of work.",research

Published: 2025

Abstract: With the advent of human neuroimaging, researchers were drawn to the idea that by better understanding the human brain, more effective mental health interventions could be developed. It has been more than 20 years since the first functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies were conducted to examine changes in brain activation with anxiety-related treatments and more than 60 studies have since been published in this vein. For the current review, we conduct a systematic review of this literature, focusing on adult studies using task-based fMRI to measure brain activation changes with pharmacologic or psychotherapy interventions for phobia, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Neuroscientific theories of anxiety-related disorders and their treatment have focused on prefrontal-insula-amygdala networks. Treatment-related decreases in amygdala and/or anterior insula activation were identified as the most consistent finding across disorders, with the most consistent results reported for specific phobia. Directionality of change and specific regions implicated in the prefrontal cortex were inconsistent across studies. The potential importance for probing other networks and processes as mechanisms of anxiety treatment was recognized, such as striatal regions underlying inhibitory learning or reward responsivity. Future treatment-fMRI research related to anxiety disorders would benefit from larger sample sizes, use of more nuanced computational approaches, and increased focus on replication.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to systematically review available literature reporting vessel patency and how this correlates with cold symptoms following the treatment of a single forearm artery injury when the hand remains perfused. The outcomes of those treated by ligation were compared to those treated with vessel repair. METHODS: Electronic databases including PubMed, Embase (Elsevier) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Willey) were searched for studies that reported the outcomes of patients who underwent either ligation or repair of single vessel injuries to hands that remained perfused at time of presentation. Level of evidence was determined by two independent reviewers. Studies were then sorted based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and application of inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 19 studies were included for statistical analysis. The patency of repaired vessels was calculated (with comparison between those with radial versus ulnar repair) as was the prevalence of cold symptoms in both ligation (or repairs that went on to occlusion) and repair groups. RESULTS: The average patency of radial and ulnar artery repairs was 68.39% and 65.56% respectively. There was no significant difference between the success rates of these repair groups (pooled estimates for odd ratios was 1.02, p=0.867). The average incidence of cold symptoms in those who underwent ligation (or repair that when on to occlusion) and those that had patent repairs were 19.82% and 17.27% respectively.

Authors: Sterre van der Ziel, Elske Hogendoorn, Brian A Jorge et al. Published: Mar 2025

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Young children frequently experience physical symptoms, such as common cold, vaccination pain or a playground injury. Picture books about physical symptoms and illness are a source of information for young children. This study assessed the nature and causes of and responses to physical symptoms depicted in Dutch children's picture books. METHODS: A systematic search for Dutch picture books for children between the ages of 2 and 8 years about physical symptoms or illness was conducted in public library catalogues in the Netherlands, with terms such as 'pain' and 'doctor'. Only picture books with a fictional storyline, in which the main character experienced symptoms or illness, were included. A content analysis was conducted by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: Fifty-five books met the inclusion criteria. The most common symptoms were injuries (29%), cold symptoms (21%), fatigue/malaise (14%) and fever (11%). Causes were mostly unknown (41%), due to accidents (38%) or infections (18%). Accidents were always caused by the main character. In 89% of the picture books, remedies were necessary to resolve the symptoms, including bandages (36%), bedrest (33%), medical interventions (33%) or medication (27%). Fifty-six percent of the books depicted seeking medical care. Four themes regarding the morals of the stories were identified: the seemingly scary hospital or doctor, the responsibility of the main character to engage in coping strategies, the importance of social contacts, and illness gains after possible unpleasantness of symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The picture books about physical symptoms and illness in our sample depicted various symptoms, limited causes and a range of responses.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) impact all age groups and have a significant economic and social burden on society, worldwide. Most URTIs are mild and self-limiting, but due to the wide range of possible causative agents, including Rhinovirus (hRV), Adenovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Coronavirus and Influenza, there is no single and effective treatment. Over-the-counter (OTC) remedies, including traditional medicines and those containing plant derived substances, help to alleviate symptoms including inflammation, pain, fever and cough. PURPOSE: This systematic review focuses on the role of the major plant derived substances in several OTC remedies used to treat cold symptoms, with a particular focus on the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels involved in pain and cough. METHODS: Literature searches were done using Pubmed and Web of Science, with no date limitations, using the principles of the PRISMA statement. The search terms used were 'TRP channel AND plant compound', 'cough AND plant compound', 'cough AND TRP channels AND plant compound', 'cough AND P2X3 AND plant compound' and 'P2X3 AND plant compound' where plant compound represents menthol or camphor or eucalyptus or turpentine or thymol. RESULTS: The literature reviewed showed that menthol activates TRPM8 and may inhibit respiratory reflexes reducing irritation and cough. Menthol has a bimodal action on TRPA1, but inhibition may have an analgesic effect. Eucalyptus also activates TRPM8 and inhibits TRPA1 whilst down regulating P2X3, aiding in the reduction of cough, pain and airway irritation. Camphor inhibits TRPA1 and the activation of TRPM8 may add to the effects of menthol.",research

Authors: Theresa Donhauser, Katharina Piontek, Ann-Kristin Baalmann et al. Published: Jul 2025

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are standardized questionnaires for the assessment of health outcomes directly from the patient. A systematic evaluation of the quality of PROMs for acute bronchitis (AB) and acute cough due to (lower) respiratory tract infection or common cold has not yet been performed. The present study aimed to systematically review the quality of available PROMs for AB and acute cough due to (lower) respiratory tract infection or common cold for use in adults and children. METHODOLOGY: Embase, PubMed and Web of Science were searched for studies reporting on the development and/or validation of any PROMs for AB and acute cough due to (lower) respiratory tract infection or common cold. We assessed the methodological quality of each included study, evaluated the quality of measurement properties per PROM and study, and graded the evidence according to the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) methodology. Based on the overall evidence, we derived recommendations for use of the instruments. RESULTS: We included three studies on three PROMs for adults measuring disease severity (Acute Bronchitis Severity Score (ABSS); Symptom Diary) and cough-related quality of life (Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ-acute)). For children, we included two studies on two PROMs assessing quality of life (Parent-proxy Children's Acute Cough-specific QoL Questionnaire (PAC-QoL CONCLUSIONS: None of the identified PROMs can be unrestrictedly recommended for use in future research. For adults, the LCQ-acute appears the most suitable tool warranting further validation.",research

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Since there is still no definitive conclusion regarding which non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are most effective and safe in viral respiratory infections, we decided to evaluate the efficacy and safety of various NSAIDs in viral respiratory infections so that we can reach a conclusion on which NSAID is best choice for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A search was performed in Medline (via PubMed), Embase and CENTRAL databases until 23 March 2020. Clinical trials on application of NSAIDs in viral respiratory infections were included. RESULTS: Six clinical trials were included. No clinical trial has been performed on COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome infections. Studies show that ibuprofen and naproxen not only have positive effects in controlling cold symptoms, but also do not cause serious side effects in rhinovirus infections. In addition, it was found that clarithromycin, naproxen and oseltamivir combination leads to decrease in mortality rate and duration of hospitalisation in patients with pneumonia caused by influenza. CONCLUSION: Although based on existing evidence, NSAIDs have been effective in treating respiratory infections caused by influenza and rhinovirus, since there is no clinical trial on COVID-19 and case-reports and clinical experiences are indicative of elongation of treatment duration and exacerbation of the clinical course of patients with COVID-19, it is recommended to use substitutes such as acetaminophen for controlling fever and inflammation and be cautious about using NSAIDs in management of COVID-19 patients until there are enough evidence. Naproxen may be a good choice for future clinical trials.",research

who_diarrhoea_01,Diarrhoea,World Health Organization,https://www.who.int/health-topics/diarrhoea,Public,2026-01-26,"WHO Health Topic: Diarrhoea Overview: Diarrhoeal disease is the second leading cause of death in children under five years old, and was responsible for the deaths of 370,000 children in 2019. The most severe threat posed by diarrhoea is dehydration. During an episode of diarrhoea, water and electrolytes including sodium, chloride, potassium and bicarbonate are lost through liquid stools, vomit, sweat, urine and breathing. A person with diarrhoea becomes dehydrated when these losses are not replaced. In addition, diarrhoea is a major cause of malnutrition, making the person more susceptible to future bouts of diarrhoea and to other diseases. There are three clinical types of diarrhoea, each with its specific treatments: Acute watery diarrhoea, which may last several hours or days, and includes cholera. Acute bloody diarrhoea, also called dysentery. Persistent diarrhoea, lasting 14 days or longer. In the past, for most children, severe dehydration and fluid loss were the main causes of dying from diarrhoea. Now, other causes such as septic bacterial infections are likely to account for an increasing proportion of all diarrhoea-associated deaths. Exclusive breastfeeding is protective and prevents diarrhoea from occurring in young children. Breastfeeding also reduces the severity of diarrhoea. Innovative activities and demand creation are important for achieving behaviour change and sustaining long-term preventive practices to combat preventable morbidity and mortality from diarrhoeal diseases. Symptoms Diarrhoea is the passage of 3 or more loose or liquid stools per day, or more frequently than is normal for the individual. It is usually a symptom of gastrointestinal infection, which can be caused by a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms. Infection is spread through contaminated food or drinking-water, or from person to person as a result of poor hygiene. Treatment Key measures to prevent diarrhoea include the following: access to safe drinking-water.",guidelines

Key measures to treat diarrhoea include the following: Rehydration with oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution: ORS, particularly the low osmolarity formula, are a proven life-saving commodity for the treatment of children with diarrhoea. Rehydration may require intravenous fluids in case of severe dehydration or shock. Zinc supplements reduce the duration of a diarrhoea episode by 25% and are associated with a 30% reduction in stool volume. Nutrient-rich foods: the vicious circle of malnutrition and diarrhoea can be broken by continuing to give nutrient-rich foods – including breast milk – during an episode, and by giving a nutritious diet – including exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life – to children when they are well. Consulting a health professional , in particular for management of persistent diarrhoea, or when there is blood in the stool, or if there are signs of dehydration. Adequate nutrition is key to improving natural defenses, starting with exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life.

It is preventable and curable. There are 5 parasite species that cause malaria in humans, and 2 of these species – Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax – pose the greatest threat. In 2024, nearly half of the world's population was at risk of malaria. While sub-Saharan Africa carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden, the WHO Regions of South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean, Western Pacific, and the Americas also report significant numbers of cases . There were an estimated 282 million cases of malaria in 2024, and the estimated number of malaria deaths stood at 610 000. In 2024, the African Region was home to 94% and 95% of malaria cases and deaths, respectively. Children under 5 years of age are most at risk of severe complications from malaria; in 2024, they accounted for nearly 75% of all malaria deaths in the WHO African Region. Symptoms Malaria is an acute febrile illness. In a non-immune individual, symptoms usually appear 10–15 days after the infective mosquito bite.

It is caused by any one of four closely related dengue viruses (called serotypes), which can lead to a broad spectrum of symptoms, including some that are extremely mild (unnoticeable) to those who may require medical intervention and hospitalization. In severe cases, fatalities can occur. There is no treatment for the infection itself, but the symptoms that a patient experiences can be managed. In 2023, WHO graded dengue as a Grade 3 emergency after outbreaks increased in several countries. Dengue epidemics tend to have seasonal patterns, with transmission often peaking during and after rainy seasons . Several factors contribute to this increase, including high mosquito population levels, susceptibility to circulating serotypes, favourable air temperatures , precipitation and humidity, all of which affect the reproduction and feeding patterns of mosquito populations, as well as the dengue virus incubation period. Unplanned urbanization and climatic factors such as heat waves and high temperatures have increased the intensity, frequency, duration and distribution of dengue in recent years. Lack of sustained surveillance and control interventions as well as staff are some of the other challenges. Absence of an integrated programmatic approach continues to affect countries. Symptoms Dengue is a self-limiting febrile illness with symptoms ranging from extremely mild (asymptomatic) to severe. Symptoms of dengue may be observed around 4–10 days after the bite of an infected mosquito. Common symptoms are like those of the flu, with patients experiencing: fever, headaches, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, nausea/vomiting, rash and fatigue. As the disease progresses, patients can also experience respiratory distress, bleeding from the nose and gums and rapid drop in blood pressure leading to shock. If left unmanaged, this can lead to death.",guidelines

Dengue is increasing at a faster rate than any other communicable disease, with a significant increase over 24 years (2000–2024). Annual dengue incidence is estimated to be in the order of 100 million symptomatic cases a year, with another ~300 million asymptomatic infections. The greatest burden is seen in Asia (75%), followed by Latin America and Africa. 2024 recorded the highest levels of dengue with 14 305 764 cases and 10 576 deaths reported from 112 countries to WHO. WHO has established a global dengue surveillance dashboard to track cases from all regions. ( https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/dengue_global/ ) Treatment There are no specific antiviral treatments against dengue fever. Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) is indicated to bring down the fever. Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) and related non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as Ibuprofen) should be avoided. Recovery from infection by one dengue virus provides lifelong immunity against that particular virus serotype. However, this immunity confers only partial and transient protection against subsequent infection by the other three serotypes of the virus. Evidence suggests that sequential infection increases the risk of developing severe dengue. The time interval between infections and the particular viral sequence of infections may also be of importance. Currently, only one vaccine is available for dengue prevention. WHO recommends the use of Q-denga (TAK-003) in children aged 6–16 years in settings with high intensity of dengue transmission. The vaccination course consists of two injections given 3 months apart The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes during the daytime.

Cholera remains a global threat to public health and is an indicator of inequity and lack of social development. Researchers have estimated that every year, there are 1.3 to 4.0 million cases of cholera, and 21 000 to 143 000 deaths worldwide due to the infection. Cholera is an extremely serious disease that can cause severe acute watery diarrhoea with severe dehydration. It takes between 12 hours and 5 days for a person to show symptoms after consuming contaminated food or water. Cholera affects both children and adults and can kill within hours if untreated. Most people infected with Vibrio cholerae do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their faeces for 1-10 days after infection. This means the bacteria are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people. Cholera is often predictable and preventable. It can ultimately be eliminated where access to clean water and sanitation facilities, as well as good hygiene practices, are ensured and sustained for the whole population. Prevention and control Measures for the prevention of cholera mostly consist of providing clean water and proper sanitation to populations who do not yet have access to basic services, as well as vaccination with Oral Cholera Vaccines. Health education and good food hygiene are also essential. Communities should be reminded of basic hygienic behaviours. These include the need to always wash hands with soap after defecation and before handling food or eating, as well as safe preparation and conservation of food. Strengthening surveillance and early warning systems are important measures to allow detection of the first cases in an outbreak and to put in place control measures as quickly as possible.",guidelines

The development and implementation of multi-sectoral cholera control plans is a useful mechanism to bring together all relevant sectors, and forge lines of communication and coordination that are valuable beyond cholera control. Vaccines Since the creation of the global stockpile in 2013, more than 50 million doses of Oral cholera vaccines (OCV) have been successfully used in various settings through mass campaigns. OCV is a tool that is used in addition to classic cholera control measures. It should be systematically considered in both endemic cholera hotspots as well as during outbreaks and emergencies.

TB is spread through the air when people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit. A person needs to inhale only a few germs to become infected. Every year, 10 million people fall ill with tuberculosis (TB). Despite being a preventable and curable disease, 1.5 million people die from TB each year – making it the world’s top infectious killer. TB is the leading cause of death of people with HIV and also a major contributor to antimicrobial resistance. Most of the people who fall ill with TB live in low- and middle-income countries, but TB is present all over the world. About half of all people with TB can be found in 8 countries: Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines and South Africa. About a quarter of the global population is estimated to have been infected with TB bacteria, but most people will not go on to develop TB disease and some will clear the infection. Those who are infected but not (yet) ill with the disease cannot transmit it. People infected with TB bacteria have a 5–10% lifetime risk of falling ill with TB. Those with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, malnutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco, have a higher risk of falling ill. Symptoms Common symptoms of TB disease include: • Prolonged cough • Chest pain • Weakness or fatigue • Weight loss • Fever • Night sweats Often, these symptoms will be mild for many months, thus leading to delays in seeking care and increasing the risk of spreading the infection to others. If the healthcare provider suspects a patient to have TB disease, they will send the patient for testing. In the case of suspected lung TB disease, patients will be asked to give a sputum sample for testing for TB bacteria. For non-lung TB disease, samples of affected body fluids and tissue can be tested.",guidelines

In particular, types B and C lead to chronic disease in hundreds of millions of people and together are the most common cause of liver cirrhosis, liver cancer and viral hepatitis-related deaths. They are among the main infectious disease killers, causing an estimated 1.3 million deaths per year. An estimated 304 million people worldwide live with hepatitis B or C, and for most, testing and treatment remain beyond reach. WHO’s Global Health Sector Strategy on HIV, Viral Hepatitis and Sexually Transmitted Infections (2022–2030) outlines clear targets to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health problem. The strategy aims to reduce new hepatitis infections to 520 000 cases annually and hepatitis-related deaths to 450 000 by 2030, which represents a 90% reduction in incidence and a 65% reduction in mortality compared to 2015. Without urgent and sustained action, however, viral hepatitis is projected to cause an additional 9.5 million new infections, 2.1 million liver cancer cases, and 2.8 million deaths by 2030. These outcomes are largely preventable through the scale-up of hepatitis B vaccination, improved access to prevention, testing and treatment for hepatitis B and C, and targeted public education campaigns to raise awareness and reduce transmission Symptoms Many people with hepatitis A, B, C, D or E exhibit only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.",guidelines

Symptoms of viral hepatitis may include fever, malaise, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark-coloured urine and jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes). Hepatitis B, C and D virus can also cause a chronic liver infection that can later develop into cirrhosis (a scarring of the liver) or liver cancer. These patients are at risk of premature death. Hepatitis D (HDV) is only found in people already infected with hepatitis B (HBV); however, the dual infection of HBV and HDV can cause a more serious infection and accelerated progression to cirrhosis and cancer. HBV, HCV and HDV cause hepatocellular carcinoma and are considered carcinogenic. Treatment Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and when given at birth, as part of the childhood vaccination series, strongly reduces the risk of transmission from mother to child. Hepatitis B vaccination also protects against hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection. Chronic HBV infection can be treated with antiviral agents. Treatment can slow the progression of cirrhosis, reduce incidence of liver cancer and improve long term survival. Only a proportion of people with chronic HBV infection will require treatment. A vaccine also exists to prevent infections of hepatitis A (HAV) and E (HEV). It is advised to avoid unnecessary medications due to the negative effect on liver function caused by these infections. Hepatitis C (HCV) can cause both acute and chronic infection. Chronic HCV infection can lead to long-term complications, including cirrhosis or cancer. There is no vaccine for HCV. Antiviral medicines can cure more than 95% of persons with HCV infection, thereby reducing the risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer, but access to diagnosis and treatment remains globally low.",guidelines

Clinically, it has two forms: Furious rabies – characterized by hyperactivity and hallucinations. Paralytic rabies – characterized by paralysis and coma. Although fatal once clinical signs appear, rabies is entirely avoidable; vaccines, medicines and technologies have long been available to prevent death from rabies. Nevertheless, rabies still kills tens of thousands of people each year. Of these cases, approximately 99% are acquired from the bite of an infected dog. Dog-mediated human rabies can be eliminated by tackling the disease at its source: infected dogs. Making people aware of how to avoid the bites of rabid dogs, to seek treatment when bitten and to vaccinate animals can successfully disrupt the rabies transmission cycle. Rabies is estimated to cause 59 000 human deaths annually in over 150 countries, with 95% of cases occurring in Africa and Asia. Due to underreporting and uncertain estimates, this number is likely a gross underestimate. The burden of disease is disproportionally borne by rural poor populations, with approximately half of cases attributable to children under 15 years of age. Symptoms Early symptoms of a rabies infection can include a fever with pain and unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking or burning sensation (paraesthesia) at the wound site. In later states, the virus spreads to the central nervous system, causing fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. The incubation period of the disease can vary from 1 week to 1 year, though it is typically 2–3 months. The two types of rabies show different symptoms. Furious rabies causes signs of hyperactivity, excitable behaviour, hydrophobia (fear of water) and sometimes aerophobia (fear of drafts or of fresh air). Death occurs after a few days due to cardio-respiratory arrest.",guidelines
who_rabies_02,Rabies,World Health Organization,https://www.who.int/health-topics/rabies,Public,2026-01-26,"Paralytic rabies, which accounts for about 20% of the total number of human cases, runs a less dramatic and usually longer course than the furious form. Muscles gradually become paralysed, starting at the site of the bite or scratch. A coma slowly develops and eventually death occurs. The paralytic form of rabies is often misdiagnosed, contributing to the under-reporting of the disease. Treatment Vaccinating dogs is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing rabies in people, and human rabies vaccines exist for pre-exposure immunization. If you are bitten or scratched by an animal, particularly a dog: Wash the wound immediately with soap or detergent. Flush the wound thoroughly for about 15 minutes with copious amounts of water. Apply an iodine-containing or anti-viral medication to the wound 15 minutes after it has been washed and flushed. Avoid applying irritants to the wounds such as chili powder, plant juices, acids and alkalis. Avoid covering the wound with dressings or bandages. Seek transportation to a health care facility for further assessment and treatment by a healthcare professional. If possible, safely confine the biting animal and collect information on it and the bite circumstance to provide to the health care professional and public health officer. Keep the biting animal confined and under observation for 10 days. WHO continues to promote human rabies prevention through the elimination of rabies in dogs, dog bite prevention strategies, and more widespread use of the intradermal route for post-exposure prophylaxis, which reduces volume and therefore the cost of cell-cultured vaccine by 60% to 80%.",guidelines

Some of the most common are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, occupational lung diseases and pulmonary hypertension. In addition to tobacco smoke, other risk factors include air pollution, occupational chemicals and dusts, and frequent lower respiratory infections during childhood. CRDs are not curable; however, various forms of treatment that help open the air passages and improve shortness of breath can help control symptoms and improve daily life for people living with these conditions. The WHO Global Alliance against CRDs (GARD) vision is “a world in which all people breathe freely”. GARD focuses on the needs of people with CRDs in low- and middle-income countries. The aim of the WHO Chronic Respiratory Diseases Programme is to support Member States in their efforts to reduce the toll of morbidity, disability and premature mortality related to chronic respiratory diseases, specifically asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Symptoms The two most common chronic respiratory diseases are asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These both affect the airways in the lungs. Asthma is characterized by recurrent attacks of breathlessness and wheezing due to airway narrowing, which vary in severity and frequency from person to person. Symptoms may occur several times in a day or week in affected individuals, and for some people become worse during physical activity or at night. Asthma is the most common chronic disease among children. In asthma, the airway obstruction is reversible with inhaled medicines, but in COPD it is mostly fixed. COPD only affects adults and usually becomes worse with time. The most common symptoms of COPD are breathlessness or a need for air, sputum production and a chronic cough.",guidelines

Outdoor air pollution and indoor air pollution (often caused by cooking with solid fuels) are also common causes. Asthma and COPD may be prevented by reducing or avoiding exposure to these risk factors. Treatments Neither asthma nor chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be cured but treatment can reduce symptoms, prevent deterioration and improve daily life. During attacks of breathlessness caused by airway narrowing, inhaled medicines (bronchodilators) can open the airways and relieve symptoms. If untreated, severe attacks can lead to death. Appropriate management of asthma with inhaled corticosteroid medicine can control the progression of the disease and reduce deaths. Long-term treatment is required for people with persistent symptoms and exposures which trigger symptoms (e.g. smoke, fumes, dust, grass and tree pollen, animal fur and feathers) should be avoided. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is confirmed by a spirometry test, which measures how much and how quickly a person can blow air out of their lungs. Symptoms can be treated through medical and physical treatments; however, with COPD in people who smoke tobacco, the most effective treatment available is to stop smoking. This can slow down the progression of the disease and decrease COPD-related deaths. In specific cases, people may benefit from using inhaled corticosteroid medicines.

Blood is carried from the heart to all parts of the body in the vessels. Each time the heart beats, it pumps blood into the vessels. Blood pressure is created by the force of blood pushing against the walls of blood vessels (arteries) as it is pumped by the heart. The higher the pressure, the harder the heart has to pump. Hypertension is a serious medical condition and can increase the risk of heart, brain, kidney and other diseases. It is a silent killer and a major cause of premature death worldwide, with an estimated 1.4 billion people having the condition. The burden of hypertension is felt disproportionately in low- and middle-income countries, where two thirds of cases are found, largely due to increased risk factors in those populations in recent decades. Symptoms Many people with hypertension do not notice symptoms and may be unaware there is a problem. Symptoms can include early morning headaches, nosebleeds, irregular heart rhythms, vision changes, and buzzing in the ears. More severe forms may exhibit fatigue, nausea, vomiting, confusion, anxiety, chest pain, and muscle tremors. If left untreated, hypertension can cause persistent chest pain (also called angina), heart attacks, heart failure, and an irregular heartbeat, which can lead to a sudden death. Hypertension can also cause strokes by blocking or bursting arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the brain, as well as kidney damage, which can lead to kidney failure. High blood pressure causes damage to the heart by hardening arteries and decreasing the flood of blood and oxygen to the heart. Detecting hypertension is done with a quick and painless test of blood pressure. This can be done at home, but a health professional can help assess any risks or associated conditions.",guidelines

These factors include unhealthy diets (excessive salt consumption, a diet high in saturated fat and trans fats, low intake of fruits and vegetables), physical inactivity, consumption of tobacco and alcohol, and being overweight or obese. Additionally, prolonged exposure to air pollution increases the risk of hypertension in adults. There are also non-modifiable risk factors, including a family history of hypertension, age over 65 years and co-existing diseases such as diabetes or kidney disease. Avoiding dietary and behavioural risk factors is doubly important for those with unmodifiable or hereditary risk factors. Hypertension can be managed by reducing and managing mental stress, regularly checking blood pressure and consulting with health professionals, treating high blood pressure and managing other medical conditions.

Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality. WHO data show that almost all of the global population (99%) breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants , with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures. Air quality is closely linked to the earth’s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the drivers of air pollution (i.e. combustion of fossil fuels) are also sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Policies to reduce air pollution, therefore, offer a win-win strategy for both climate and health, lowering the burden of disease attributable to air pollution, as well as contributing to the near- and long-term mitigation of climate change. Impact From smog hanging over cities to smoke inside the home, air pollution poses a major threat to health and climate. Ambient (outdoor) air pollution in both cities and rural areas is causing fine particulate matter which result in strokes, heart diseases, lung cancer, acute and chronic respiratory diseases. Additionally, around 2.1 billion people are exposed to dangerous levels of household air pollution, while using polluting open fires or simple stoves for cooking fuelled by kerosene, biomass (wood, animal dung and crop waste) and coal.

Although important progress has been made in the last two decades, about 287 000 women died during and following pregnancy and childbirth in 2020. This number is unacceptably high. The most common direct causes of maternal injury and death are excessive blood loss, infection, high blood pressure, unsafe abortion, and obstructed labour, as well as indirect causes such as anemia, malaria, and heart disease. Most maternal deaths are preventable with timely management by a skilled health professional working in a supportive environment. Ending preventable maternal death must remain at the top of the global agenda. At the same time, simply surviving pregnancy and childbirth can never be the marker of successful maternal health care.

As a result, the medicines become ineffective and infections persist in the body, increasing the risk of spread to others. Antimicrobials - including antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals and antiparasitics - are medicines used to prevent and treat infections in humans, animals and plants.

In many of today’s societies, alcoholic beverages are a routine part of the social landscape for many in the population. This is particularly true for those in social environments with high visibility and societal influence, nationally and internationally, where alcohol frequently accompanies socializing. In this context, it is easy to overlook or discount the health and social damage caused or contributed to by drinking. Alcohol consumption contributes to 2.6 million deaths each year globally as well as to the disabilities and poor health of millions of people. Overall, harmful use of alcohol is responsible for 4.7% of the global burden of disease. Harmful use of alcohol is accountable for 6,9 % and 2.0% of the global burden of disease for males and females respectively. Alcohol is the leading risk factor for premature mortality and disability among those aged 20 to 39 years, accounting for 13% of all deaths in this age group. Disadvantaged and especially vulnerable populations have higher rates of alcohol-related death and hospitalization. Impact Alcohol as an intoxicant affects a wide range of structures and processes in the central nervous system and increases the risk for intentional and unintentional injuries and adverse social consequences. Alcohol has considerable toxic effects on the digestive and cardiovascular systems. Alcoholic beverages are classified as carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and increase the risk of several cancer types. Alcohol as an immunosuppressant increases the risk of communicable diseases, including tuberculosis and HIV. Both the volume of lifetime alcohol use and a combination of context, frequency of alcohol consumption and amount consumed per occasion increase the risk of the wide range of health and social harms.",guidelines

Yet, the environments in which we live can favour health or be harmful to it. Environments are highly influential on our behaviour and our exposure to health risks (for example, air pollution or violence), our access to services (for example, health and social care) and the opportunities that ageing brings. The number and proportion of people aged 60 years and older in the population is increasing. In 2019, the number of people aged 60 years and older was 1 billion. This number will increase to 1.4 billion by 2030 and 2.1 billion by 2050. This increase is occurring at an unprecedented pace and will accelerate in coming decades, particularly in developing countries. This historically significant change in the global population requires adaptations to the way societies are structured across all sectors. For example, health and social care, transportation, housing and urban planning. Working to make the world more age-friendly is an essential and urgent part of our changing demographics. Older people and COVID-19 Impact Ageing presents both challenges and opportunities. It will increase demand for primary health care and long-term care, require a larger and better trained workforce, intensify the need for physical and social environments to be made more age-friendly, and call for everyone in every sector to combat ageism. Yet, these investments can enable the many contributions of older people – whether it be within their family, to their local community (e.g., as volunteers or within the formal or informal workforce) or to society more broadly.

Oral health varies over the life course from early life to old age, is integral to general health and supports individuals in participating in society and achieving their potential. Oral diseases encompass a range of diseases and conditions that include dental caries, periodontal (gum) disease, tooth loss, oral cancer, oro-dental trauma, noma and birth defects such as cleft lip and palate. Oral diseases are among the most common noncommunicable diseases worldwide, affecting an estimated 3.5 billion people. While the global burden of oral health conditions is growing, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, the overall burden of oral health conditions on services is likely to keep increasing because of population growth and ageing. Oral diseases disproportionately affect the most vulnerable and disadvantaged populations. People of low socioeconomic status carry a higher burden of oral diseases and this association remains across the life course, from early childhood to older age, and regardless of the country's overall income level. Causes and symptoms Most oral diseases and conditions share modifiable risk factors with the leading noncommunicable diseases (diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and mental disorders). These risk factors include tobacco use, alcohol consumption and unhealthy diets high in free sugars, all of which are increasing at the global level.

While new treatments, technologies and care models can have therapeutic potential, they can also pose new threats to safe care. Patient safety is a fundamental principle of health care and is now being recognized as a large and growing global public health challenge. Global efforts to reduce the burden of patient harm have not achieved substantial change over the past 15 years, despite pioneering work in some health care settings. Patient safety is a framework of organized activities that creates cultures, processes, procedures, behaviours, technologies and environments in health care that consistently and sustainably lower risks, reduce the occurrence of avoidable harm, make error less likely and reduce its impact when it does occur. Every point in the process of care-giving contains a certain degree of inherent unsafety. Clear policies, organizational leadership capacity, data to drive safety improvements, skilled health care professionals and effective involvement of patients and families in the care process, are all needed to ensure sustainable and significant improvements in the safety of health care. Burden Patient safety in health care is an urgent and serious global public health concern. Patient harm exerts a very high burden on all health care systems across the world. Every year, an inadmissible number of patients suffer injuries or die because of unsafe and poor quality health care. Most of these injuries are avoidable. The burden of unsafe care broadly highlights the magnitude and scale of the problem. Patient harm due to adverse events is likely to be among the 10 leading causes of death and disability worldwide.

It spreads mainly through close contact with someone who has mpox, causing a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes and fever. It can make people very sick and leave scars. The disease mainly spreads from person to person through close contact. This includes, but isn’t limited to, sexual contact. Transmission occurs through exposure to bodily fluids; lesions on the skin or on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth or throat; respiratory particles; and contaminated objects. In areas where animals carry the virus, mpox is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can spread from animals to humans. It's found in tropical rainforests in central, east and west Africa, where small mammals such as squirrels, Gambian pouched rats, dormice, and various species of monkeys may be carriers. Since May 2022, mpox has spread globally, with cases reported from countries without previously documented mpox transmission. The spread in most countries today is from people and not animals. Symptoms Mpox typically causes a fever, a rash resembling pimples or blisters and swollen lymph nodes. Symptoms usually appear within a week of exposure but can take anywhere from 1 to 21 days to develop. The illness often begins with a feverish phase lasting 1 to 3 days with symptoms including intense headache, swollen lymph nodes back pain, muscle aches and severe fatigue. The first stage is followed by the skin eruption stage, lasting from 2 to 4 weeks. Lesions evolve from macules (lesions with a flat base) to papules (raised firm painful lesions) to vesicles (filled with clear fluid) to pustules (filled with pus), followed by scabs or crusts. They can leave scars. For some people, the first symptom of mpox is the rash. Some people with mpox become very sick and it can even be fatal in some cases.",guidelines

Prevention and treatment Prevention and control of mpox rely on raising awareness in communities and educating health workers to prevent infection and stop transmission. Mpox vaccines also provide protection against infection and severe disease. WHO recommends the use of vaccines for those most at risk of exposure during outbreaks, including people who have had close contact with someone with mpox, and health workers. People who were vaccinated against smallpox in childhood may have some cross-protection against mpox. To prevent spread, close contact with people who have mpox or with contaminated materials should be avoided. Masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment should be worn while taking care of the sick, whether in a health facility or at home. Where animal-to-human transmission is possible, contact with sick or dead animals should be avoided, and all foods containing animal meat or parts must be properly cooked before consumption.

Abstract: Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most common type of chronic recurring head pain. It can occur twice as often in women as in men. It is the most common type of headache. Its lifetime prevalence is 30% to 78% in the general population. TTH treatment should be multilevel. It often consists of taking pain medication, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, using biofeedback therapy, acupuncture, and attending behavioral therapy. Several clinical trials also suggest that botulinum toxin (BTX) may be an effective treatment option for such patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate if BTX can be used as a treatment method in TTH in the light of current medical literature. The authors searched the PubMed, EBSCOhost, OVID, Web of Knowledge, Cochrane Library and CINAHL databases to identify relevant publications. The authors finally included 11 papers—prospective and retrospective cohort studies. Among most of the selected studies, there was a significant correlation between using BTX and reduction of TTH pain intensity and severity. By analyzing qualified studies, it can be concluded that botulinum toxin seems to be effective in TTH management.",systematic_review

Abstract: Widely accepted quality indicators for headache care would provide a basis not only for assessment of care but also, and more importantly, for its improvement. The objective of the study was to identify and summarize existing information on such indicators: specifically, did indicators exist, how had they been developed, what aspects of headache care did they relate to and how and with what utility were they being used? A systematic review of the medical literature was performed. A total of 32 articles met criteria for inclusion. We identified 55 existing headache quality indicators of which 37 evaluated processes of headache care. Most were relevant only to specific populations of patients and to care delivered in high-resource settings. Indicators had been used to describe overall quality of headache care at a national level, but not systematically applied to the evaluation and improvement of headache services in other settings. Some studies had evaluated the use of existing disability and quality of life instruments, but their findings had not been incorporated into quality indicators. Existing headache care quality indicators are incomplete and inadequate for purpose. They emphasize processes of care rather than structure or outcomes, and are not widely applicable to different levels and locations of headache care. Furthermore, they do not fully incorporate accepted evidence regarding optimal methods of care. There is a clear need for consensus-based indicators that fully reflect patients’ and public-health priorities.",systematic_review

Abstract: Although monosodium glutamate (MSG) is classified as a causative substance of headache in the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition (ICHD-III beta), there is no literature in which causal relationship between MSG and headache was comprehensively reviewed. We performed systematic review of human studies which include the incidence of headache after an oral administration of MSG. An analysis was made by separating the human studies with MSG administration with or without food, because of the significant difference of kinetics of glutamate between those conditions (Am J Clin Nutr 37:194–200, 1983; J Nutr 130:1002S–1004S, 2000) and there are some papers which report the difference of the manifestation of symptoms after MSG ingestion with or without food (Food Chem Toxicol 31:1019–1035, 1993; J Nutr 125:2891S-2906S, 1995). Of five papers including six studies with food, none showed a significant difference in the incidence of headache except for the female group in one study. Of five papers including seven studies without food, four studies showed a significant difference. Many of the studies involved administration of MSG in solution at high concentrations (>2 %). Since the distinctive MSG is readily identified at such concentrations, these studies were thought not to be properly blinded. Because of the absence of proper blinding, and the inconsistency of the findings, we conclude that further studies are required to evaluate whether or not a causal relationship exists between MSG ingestion and headache.",systematic_review

Abstract: Headache is increasingly being reported as a detrimental effect of mobile phone (MP) use. However, studies aimed to investigate the association between MP use and headache yielded conflicting results. To assess the consistency of the data on the topic, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available cross-sectional studies. Published literature from PubMed and other databases were retrieved and screened, and 7 cross-sectional studies were finally included in this meta-analysis. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. We found that the risk of headache was increased by 38% in MP user compared with non-MP user (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.18–1.61, p < 0.001). Among MP users, the risk of headache was also increased in those who had longer daily call duration (2–15 min vs. <2 min: OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.34–1.98, p < 0.001; >15 min vs. <2 min: OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.76–3.54, p < 0.001) and higher daily call frequency (2–4 calls vs. <2 calls: OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.07–1.76, p < 0.001; >4 calls vs. <2 calls: OR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.78–3.58, p < 0.001).

The app criteria were intended as minimum requirements for an acceptable headache diary app that could be prescribed by health care professionals. Each app was evaluated and scored against each criterion.ResultsOf the 38 apps identified, none of the apps met all 7 app criteria. The 3 highest scoring apps, meeting 5 of the app criteria, were iHeadache (developed by Better QOL), ecoHeadache (developed by ecoTouchMedia), and Headache Diary Pro (developed by Froggyware).

We extracted data from any original research paper or case report describing a case of someone presenting with a sudden and severe headache, and summarized the published causes.ResultsOur search identified over 21,000 titles, of which 1224 articles were scrutinized in full. 213 articles described 2345 people with sudden and severe headache, and we identified 6 English language academic review articles. A total of 119 causes were identified, of which 46 (38%) were not mentioned in published academic review articles. Using capture-recapture analysis, we estimate that our search was 98% complete. There is only one population-based estimate of the incidence of sudden and severe headache at 43 cases per 100,000. In cohort studies, the most common causes identified were primary headaches or headaches of uncertain cause. Vasoconstriction syndromes are commonly mentioned in case reports or case series. The most common cause not mentioned in academic reviews was pneumocephalus. 70 non-English language articles were identified but these did not contain additional causes.ConclusionsThere are over 100 different published causes of sudden and severe headache, other than aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.",systematic_review

Abstract: This paper systematically reviewed randomized clinical trials (RCT) assessing the efficacy of manual therapies for cervicogenic headache (CEH). A total of seven RCTs were identified, i.e. one study applied physiotherapy ± temporomadibular mobilization techniques and six studies applied cervical spinal manipulative therapy (SMT). The RCTs suggest that physiotherapy and SMT might be an effective treatment in the management of CEH, but the results are difficult to evaluate, since only one study included a control group that did not receive treatment. Furthermore, the RCTs mostly included participant with infrequent CEH. Future challenges regarding CEH are substantial both from a diagnostic and management point of view.",systematic_review

Abstract: ObjectiveTo systematically review the qualitative literature of the lived experience of people with a chronic headache disorder.BackgroundChronic headaches affect 3%–4% of the population. The most common chronic headache disorders are chronic migraine, chronic tension-type headache and medication overuse headache. We present a systematic review and meta-ethnographic synthesis of the lived experience of people with chronic headache.MethodsWe searched seven electronic databases, hand-searched nine journals and used a modified Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist to appraise study quality. Following thematic analysis we synthesised the data using a meta-ethnographic approach.ResultsWe identified 3586 unique citations; full texts were examined for 86 studies and 4 were included in the review. Included studies differed in their foci: exploring, patient-centred outcomes, chronic headache as a socially invisible disease, psychological processes mediating impaired quality of life, and the process of medication overuse. Initial thematic analysis and subsequent synthesis gave three overarching themes: ‘headache as a driver of behaviour’ (directly and indirectly), ‘the spectre of headache’ and ‘strained relationships’.ConclusionThis meta-synthesis of published qualitative evidence demonstrates that chronic headaches have a profound effect on people’s lives, showing similarities with other pain conditions. There were insufficient data to explore the similarities and differences between different chronic headache disorders.",systematic_review

Abstract: ObjectiveThis systematic review aimed to assess the efficacy, effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) in patients with headache.BackgroundMigraine is one of the most common and disabling medical conditions. It affects more than 15% of the general population, causing high global socioeconomic costs, and the currently available treatment options are inadequate.MethodsWe systematically reviewed all available studies investigating the use of OMT in patients with migraine and other forms of headache.ResultsThe search of literature produced six studies, five of which were eligible for review. The reviewed papers collectively support the notion that patients with migraine can benefit from OMT. OMT could most likely reduce the number of episodes per month as well as drug use. None of the included studies, however, was classified as low risk of bias according to the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias.ConclusionThe results from this systematic review show a preliminary low level of evidence that OMT is effective in the management of headache. However, studies with more rigorous designs and methodology are needed to strengthen this evidence. Moreover, this review suggests that new manual interventions for the treatment of acute migraine are available and developing.",systematic_review

Abstract: Abstract Background. Migraine and obesity are highly prevalent and chronic diseases. Evidence has shown that obesity may influence frequency and severity of migraine attacks and is a risk factor for migraine progression. Several studies have suggested that weight loss, achieved via surgical and non-surgical means, may improve migraine. Aim. To perform a meta-analysis on the effect of weight loss obtained by bariatric surgery or behavioral intervention on migraine frequency and indices of severity. Methods. A search through Pubmed/Medline, ISI-web of knowledge and Google Scholar retrieved 10 studies (n=473) that were used for meta-analysis. Selected outcomes were Headache Frequency, Pain Intensity, Disability and Attack Duration while BMI, BMI change, type of intervention (bariatric vs behavioral), type of population (adult vs pediatric) were used for moderators and meta-regression analysis. Results. Random effect meta-analysis shows that weight loss yields significant reductions in Headache Frequency (ES -0.65, 95% C.I. -0.88 to -0.42, p<0.0001), Pain Intensity (ES -0.81, 95% C.I. -1.19 to -0.44, p<0.0001), Disability (ES -0.61, 95% C.I. -0.77 to -0.45, p<0.0001) and Attack Duration (ES -0.35, 95% C.I. -0.62 to -0.08, p=0.01). Moderators and meta-regression analysis showed that improvement in migraine was not correlated either to the degree of obesity at baseline or the degree of weight reduction. In addition, the effect on migraine was similar when weight reduction was obtained with bariatric surgery or behavioral intervention and was comparable in adult and pediatric populations.

Abstract: BackgroundObservational data have reported associations between patent foramen ovale (PFO), cryptogenic stroke and migraine. However, randomized trials of PFO closure do not demonstrate a clear benefit either because the underlying association is weaker than previously suggested or because the trials were underpowered. In order to resolve the apparent discrepancy between observational data and randomized trials, we investigated associations between (1) migraine and ischemic stroke, (2) PFO and ischemic stroke, and (3) PFO and migraine.MethodsEligibility criteria were consistent; including all studies with specifically defined exposures and outcomes unrestricted by language. We focused on studies at lowest risk of bias by stratifying analyses based on methodological design and quantified associations using fixed-effects meta-analysis models.ResultsWe included 37 studies of 7,686 identified. Compared to reports in the literature as a whole, studies with population-based comparators showed weaker associations between migraine with aura and cryptogenic ischemic stroke in younger women (OR 1.4; 95% CI 0.9–2.0; 1 study), PFO and ischemic stroke (HR 1.6; 95 CI 1.0–2.5; 2 studies; OR 1.3; 95% CI 0.9–1.9; 3 studies), or PFO and migraine (OR 1.0; 95% CI 0.6–1.6; 1 study). It was not possible to look for interactions or effect modifiers. These results are limited by sources of bias within individual studies.ConclusionsThe overall pairwise associations between PFO, cryptogenic ischemic stroke and migraine do not strongly suggest a causal role for PFO. Ongoing randomized trials of PFO closure may need larger numbers of participants to detect an overall beneficial effect.",systematic_review

Abstract: Evidence suggests that migraine activity is influenced by hormonal factors, and particularly by estrogen levels, but relatively few studies have investigated the prevalence and characteristics of migraine according to the menopausal status. Overall, population-based studies have shown an improvement of migraine after menopause, with a possible increase in perimenopause. On the contrary, the studies performed on patients referring to headache centers have shown no improvement or even worsening of migraine. Menopause etiology may play a role in migraine evolution during the menopausal period, with migraine improvement more likely occurring after spontaneous rather than after surgical menopause. Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy has been found to be associated with migraine worsening in observational population-based studies. The effects of several therapeutic regimens on migraine has also been investigated, leading to nonconclusive results. To date, no specific preventive measures are recommended for menopausal women with migraine. There is a need for further research in order to clarify the relationship between migraine and hormonal changes in women, and to quantify the real burden of migraine after the menopause. Hormonal manipulation for the treatment of refractory postmenopausal migraine is still a matter of debate.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundThe association between patent foramen ovale (PFO) and migraine with aura (MA) is well established. However, the benefits of PFO closure are less certain in patients with migraine without aura (MwoA).MethodsWe systematically searched Pubmed for pertinent clinical studies published from January 2000 to July 2015. The primary end-point was the elimination or significant improvement of migraine symptoms after PFO closure.ResultsUpon screening an initial list of 315 publications, we identified eight studies that included 546 patients. Overall, our analysis indicated a significant improvement of migraine in 81% of MA cases compared to only 63% of MwoA cases. The summary odds ratio was 2.5 (95% confidence interval 1.09–5.73), and the benefits of PFO closure were significantly greater for patients with MA compared to patients with MwoA (P = 0.03).ConclusionsThe presence of aura provides a reference standard for the clinical selection of patients with migraine for PFO closure intervention.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12872-017-0644-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",systematic_review

Abstract: ABSTRACTCONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Many researchers have suggested that aspirin prevents migraines. However, the evidence is unclear. The aim of this study was to analyze the available evidence on the effect of aspirin as a migraine prophylactic. DESIGN AND SETTING: Systematic review, conducted at the Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná, Brazil, and at the University of São Paulo, Brazil.METHODS: We performed electronic searches in the databases of MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, WEB OF SCIENCE, the World Health Organization, CENTRAL and OpenGrey, and we also searched manually for interventional studies published before April 2016 that compared the effects of aspirin with a control, in adults. Two authors independently extracted data on the publication, population recruited, intervention (aspirin dosage, follow-up and combined treatment) and main outcomes (frequency, severity and duration of migraine). We evaluated the quality of the studies using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.RESULTS: Our search retrieved 1,098 references, of which 8 met the selection criteria for this systematic review. The total population was 28,326 participants (18-64 years old); most (96%) were men. The dosage varied from 50 to 650 mg/day across the studies. The risk of bias was generally low or unclear. The only outcome for which most of the studies included (6/8) reported a significant reduction was frequency of migraine, which was reduced at an aspirin dosage of at least 325 mg/day.CONCLUSION: Aspirin can reduce the frequency of migraines. However, the optimal dosage is unclear.",systematic_review

Abstract: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with a number of human disorders, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, frailty, and infections. Since an association between vitamin D and migraine has also been recently speculated, we performed an electronic search on Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science using the keywords “migraine” and “vitamin D,” “25OH-D” “cholecalciferol,” “ergocalciferol,” with no language or date restriction. The electronic search allowed identifying seven studies (3 observational, 2 cross-sectional, and 2 case reports). The two case reports, including four women, showed favourable effects of vitamin D supplementation on migraine severity, but these studies were small and not placebo controlled. As regards the three observational studies, vitamin D deficiency was observed in 13.2 to 14.8% of migraine patients, and these rates do not differ from those reported in the general population (i.e., vitamin D deficiency between 22 and 42%). The results of the two cross-sectional studies are even more controversial, since no association was found between vitamin D status and migraine in both trials. In conclusion, the current evidence suggests that the association between migraine and vitamin D lacks reliable scientific support.",systematic_review

Abstract: Randomized clinical trials (RCT) assessing the efficacy and tolerability of triptans compared with placebo as short-term prophylaxis of menstrual migraine (MM) were systematically reviewed in this study. Triptans, which interfere with the pathogenesis of migraine and are effective in relieving associated neurovegetative symptoms, have been extensively proposed for prevention of menstrual migraine attacks. We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE for randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials on triptans for MM until 1 Oct, 2012. A total of six RCTs were identified. Two authors independently assessed trial’s quality and extracted data. Numbers of participants free from MM per perimenstrual period (PMP), requiring rescue medication, suffering from headache-associated symptoms and experiencing adverse events in treatment and control groups were used to calculate relative risk (RR) and number needed to treat (NNT) with their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of 633 participants received frovatriptan 2.5 mg QD, 584 received frovatriptan 2.5 mg BID, 392 received naratriptan 1 mg BID, 70 received naratriptan 2.5 mg BID, 80 received zolmitriptan 2.5 mg BID, 83 received zolmitriptan 2.5 mg TID and 1104 received placebo.

Abstract: ObjectiveHigh prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) was observed in patients with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). However, it is still unknown whether CP/CPPS is a risk factor of ED. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between CP/CPPS and ED.MethodsPubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane library were searched up to November 2014 to identify literatures that reported the association between CP/CPPS and ED. Case-control, cohort or cross-sectional studies were included. Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment scale was used in assessing qualities of included case-control and cohort studies and an eleven item quality assessment table was used in cross-sectional studies. This meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Odds ratio of ED and mean difference of 5-item International Index of Erectile Function scores were pooled across studies and analyzed using random effect model.ResultsA total of 3 cross-sectional studies, 2 case-control studies and 4 retrospective studies with 31,956 participants were included to calculate pooled OR of ED, and 2 studies for pooled mean difference of IIEF-5 score. A strong correlation between CP/CPPS and ED (pooled OR: 3.02, 95% CI: 2.18-4.17, P<0.01) was found, with significant heterogeneity across studies (I2=65%, P<0.01). Also a significant decrease of IIFE-5 score in CP/CPPS group (pooled MD: –4.54, 95% CI: –5.11-–3.98, P<0.01) was observed.ConclusionsPatients with CP/CPPS have a more increased risk of suffering from ED, but the mechanisms were unclear.

Abstract: BackgroundNausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) and hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) have a significant impact on quality of life. Medication to relieve symptoms of NVP and HG are available but pregnant women and their caregivers have been concerned about the teratogenic effect, side effects and poor efficacy. The aim of this review was to investigate if there is any clinical evidence for the efficacy of acustimulation in the treatment of NVP or HG.MethodsA systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including both English and Chinese databases was conducted to assess the efficacy of various techniques of acustimulation for NVP and HG. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane’s risks of bias tool. Revised STRICTA (2010) criteria were used to appraise acustimulation procedures. Pooled relative risks (RRp) and standard mean deviations (SMD) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from the data provided by the investigators of the original trials.ResultsTwenty-nine trials including 3519 patients met the inclusion criteria. Twenty trials could be included in statistical pooling. The overall effect of different acustimulation techniques shows a significant reduction for the combined outcome for NVP or HG in pregnancy as a dichotomous variable (RRp 1.73, 95 % CI 1.43 to 2.08). Studies with continuous outcome measures for nausea, vomiting and the combined outcome did not show any evidence for relieving symptoms of NVP and HG (SMD −0.12, 95 % CI −0.35 to 0.12).ConclusionsAlthough there is some evidence for an effect of acustimulation on nausea and vomiting or hyperemesis in pregnancy, results are not conclusive.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundNausea and vomiting (NV) is the most common health condition experienced by up to 80% of pregnant women. Although nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) is a natural condition and self-limiting, it has many negative impacts on the women’s overall health particularly quality of life (QoL). However, there is no summarized evidence that provides comprehensive information about the impact of NVP on health-related quality of life (HRQoL).ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to summarize the available empirical evidence on the impact of NV on QoL during pregnancy.MethodsFive electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, MIDIRS, PsycINFO, Web of Science) were searched using keywords and index terms identified in the first step. All databases were searched for studies published in English from January 2010 to February 2025. Studies were included if they assessed the impact of NVP on QoL among pregnant women. The National Institute of Health (NIH) quality assessment tool was used for risk of bias and quality assessment. The overall quality of the evidence was rated based on the GRADE approach.Results and DiscussionFollowing screening against the inclusion and exclusion criteria nine full-text studies were included for final analysis. In most studies pregnant women with NVP had significantly lower quality of life scores in most domains of the QoL components including, MCS and PCS of SF-36 and SF-12 and the NVPQoL compared with women without NVP.

Abstract: BackgroundDespite the presence of a plethora of publications on the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) only little is known how to treat established symptoms. Besides the high effort of performing these efficacy trials (much more patients must give their consent than are actually included in a study) and ethical concerns, little is known about the rate of re-occurring PONV/vomiting after placebo. As a consequence investigators will have difficulties defining a clinically relevant effect for the new treatment which is crucial for any planning. A quantitative systematic review was performed in order to provide more reliable estimates of the incidence of re-occurring PONV/vomiting after placebo and to help investigators defining a clinically relevant treatment effect.MethodsA systematic search of the literature was performed using an extended search strategy of a previous review. Data on the recurrence of PONV (any nausea or emetic symptom) and vomiting (retching or vomiting) was extracted from published reports treating PONV with placebo and unpublished results from two observational trials where no treatment was given. A nonlinear random effects model was used to calculate estimates of the recurrence of symptoms and their 95%-confidence intervals (95%-CI).ResultsA total of 29 trials (including the unpublished data) were eligible for the calculations.",systematic_review

Abstract: AbstractBackgroundGynecological surgery is generally associated with a high risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), for which a combination of antiemetic therapies is advised, but adherence to these protocols is often low. Given the current reality, a preferred 5‐HT3 receptor antagonist for preventing PONV as a result of gynecological operations might be desirable. However, the efficiency of different 5‐HT3 receptor antagonists in gynecological operations was not clear.ObjectiveTo assess the effectiveness of different 5‐HT3 antagonists in preventing PONV after gynecological surgery.Search StrategyElectronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, were searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) from their inception up to September 20, 2023.Selection CriteriaPatients who received only 5‐HT3 antagonists to prevent nausea and vomiting following gynecologic surgical procedures were included.

Abstract: Nausea and vomiting are distressing symptoms for patients receiving chemotherapy. Moxibustion, which involves the use of burning moxa to generate heat and stimulate acupoints, has been reported to potentially ameliorate chemotherapy-induced side effects, particularly nausea and vomiting. This systematic review evaluated current evidence on the effectiveness of moxibustion against chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). We searched eight online databases and two trial registries for relevant trials. The random-effects model was used to conduct a meta-analysis. Furthermore, the risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) were used to explain dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively; the outcomes were within 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The results revealed that moxibustion might more favorably relieve the severity and frequency of CINV, compared with no treatment (RR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.42–2.93); moxibustion might have stronger effects than antiemetic drugs (RR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.27–2.76). There is no robust result that moxibustion could enhance the effects of antiemetic drugs administered as a complementary treatment. Actual moxibustion (8.10 ± 10.98) may have more favorable effects than placebo moxibustion (46.67 ± 23.32). However, the evidence obtained is not sufficient because of the lack of strict clinical trials. Protocol Registration. This trial is registered with PROSPERO CRD42016030037.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundPostoperative nausea and vomiting is a distressing complication of surgery, and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are often prescribed to prevent it. Ondansetron is the agent typically administered to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting. Although ramosetron has a longer duration of action than ondansetron, it remains unclear whether ramosetron is the more effective medication. We performed an updated meta-analysis on the comparative efficacy of ramosetron and ondansetron in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting.MethodsWe searched six databases for all trials that randomly assigned patients to ramosetron or ondansetron groups. The primary outcome was postoperative nausea or vomiting in the early, late, and next-day periods. The secondary outcomes were side effects of the medications. We used the random-effects model to combine the results. Trial sequential analyses were performed to correct for repetitive testing in the updated meta-analysis.ResultsTwenty-seven randomized controlled trials with 3,811 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The combined results of ramosetron vs. ondansetron efficacy in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting were as follows: Risk ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.82 [0.69–0.98] for early postoperative nausea, 0.76 [0.65–0.89] for late postoperative nausea, 0.69 [0.57–0.84] for next-day postoperative nausea, 0.78 [0.63–0.98] for early postoperative vomiting, 0.57 [0.45–0.72] for late postoperative vomiting, and 0.61 [0.43–0.86] for next-day postoperative vomiting.

Abstract: BackgroundAcupuncture therapy for preventive and treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting(PONV), a condition which commonly present after anaesthesia and surgery is a subject of growing interest. ObjectiveThis paper included a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effect of different type of acupuncture and acupoint selection in PONV prevention and treatment. MethodsRandomised controlled trials(RCTs) comparing acupuncture with non-acupuncture treatment were identified from databases PubMed, Cochrane, EBSCO, Ovid, CNKI and Wanfangdata. Meta-analysis on eligible studies was performed using fixed-effects model with RevMan 5.2. Results were expressed as RR for dichotomous data, with 95%CI. ResultsThirty RCTs, 1276 patients (intervention) and 1258 patients (control) were identified. Meta-analysis showed that PC6 acupuncture significantly reduced the number of cases of early vomiting (postoperative 0-6h) (RR=0.36, 95%CI 0.19,0.71; P=0.003) and nausea (postoperative 0-24h) (RR=0.25, 95%CI 0.10,0.61; P=0.002), but not early nausea (postoperative 0-6h) (RR=0.64, 95%CI 0.34,1.19; P=0.150) and vomiting (postoperative 0-24h) (RR=0.82, 95%CI 0.48,1.38; P=0.450). PC6 acupressure significantly reduced the number of cases of nausea (RR=0.71, 95%CI 0.57,0.87; P=0.001) and vomiting (RR=0.62, 95%CI 0.49,0.80; P=0.000) at postoperative 0-24h.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Nausea and vomiting (NV) are common and distressing adverse effects among cancer patients undergoing treatment. Despite the widespread use of pharmacological antiemetics, these medications are often insufficient for controlling nausea and may cause medication interactions and side effects. Acupuncture has been proposed as a complementary therapy; however, the comprehensive analysis of its effects on NV across all emetogenic cancer treatments remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in managing NV in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery. Materials and Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search across three electronic databases and two clinical registry platforms from inception to December 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating acupuncture for NV in cancer patients were included. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Safety outcomes were assessed based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Results: Seventeen RCTs met the inclusion criteria, with twelve studies included in the meta-analysis. Acupuncture did not demonstrate significant effects on acute nausea (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.84–1.15; p = 0.80) or acute vomiting (RR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.65–1.32; p = 0.67). However, it significantly reduced delayed vomiting (RR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.61–0.95; p = 0.02). Subgroup analysis demonstrated significant effects when acupuncture was administered for at least five days (RR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.39–0.81; p = 0.002). The most frequently used acupoints were PC6, ST36, CV12, LI4, LR3, and ST25.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundTo investigate the association between nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP), including hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), and postpartum depression (PPD), and to identify predictive symptoms of PPD to improve preventive care and follow-up.MethodsA systematic search was conducted in six databases from inception to June 25, 2024, using predefined keywords and MeSH terms related to PPD and pregnancy-related vomiting.Eligible studies included original research articles examining the association between PPD and NVP (any duration or severity, including HG). Articles were restricted to English or French. Diagnostic criteria for NVP and PPD had to be clearly specified.The systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024508214). Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Two independent researchers conducted article screening, data extraction, and bias assessment.ResultsOut of 355 identified articles, 18 (mainly prospective and retrospective cohort studies) were included. Analysis revealed a significantly increased risk of PPD in women with NVP, ranging from adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of 1.54 [95% CI 1.42–1.68] for mild NVP to 6.52 [95% CI 3.76–11.30] for severe NVP and 2.26 [95% CI 1.04–4.92] for persistent symptoms. These values represent the lowest and highest aORs reported in individual studies, not a pooled meta-analytic estimate. The association remained significant in large-scale studies after adjusting for confounders.ConclusionsThis review highlights the importance of monitoring the severity and duration of NVP during pregnancy.",systematic_review

Abstract: PurposeDelayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) remains an important adverse effect of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy not containing anthracyclines and cyclophosphamide (non-AC MEC). In this review, we summarize current literature to update recommendations for delayed CINV prophylaxis after non-AC MEC.MethodsWe conducted a systematic search in PubMed and conference proceedings from ASCO, ESMO, and MASCC. Included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of two or more antiemetic strategies in the prevention of delayed CINV after the administration of non-AC MEC. At least one of the following endpoints was used: complete response, complete control, no nausea, no vomiting, and/or no use of rescue medication.ResultsOur search provided 247 publications. Nine met the predefined criteria. Included RCTs reported outcomes on palonosetron, aprepitant, casopitant, netupitant/palonosetron (NEPA), olanzapine, and megestrol acetate.ConclusionsSuperiority of palonosetron over first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists for the prevention of acute and delayed CINV after non-AC MEC has not been proven. The addition of an NK1 receptor antagonist to first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists does not significantly improve the incidence of delayed CINV after non-AC MEC. The efficacy of a single-day regimen of dexamethasone with palonosetron is non-inferior to multiday dexamethasone.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundParents of febrile children frequently contact primary care. Longer duration of fever has been related to increased risk for serious bacterial infections (SBI). However, the evidence for this association remains controversial. We assessed the predictive value of duration of fever for SBI.MethodsStudies from MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases (from January 1991 to December 2009) were retrieved. We included studies describing children aged 2 months to 6 years in countries with high Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccination coverage. Duration of fever had to be studied as a predictor for serious bacterial infections.ResultsSeven studies assessed the association between duration of fever and serious bacterial infections; three of these found a relationship.ConclusionThe predictive value of duration of fever for identifying serious bacterial infections in children remains inconclusive.

Abstract: Study Design Systematic review.Objective To determine the incidence, pathogenesis, and clinical outcomes related to neurogenic fevers following traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).Methods A systematic review of the literature was performed on thermodysregulation secondary to acute traumatic SCI in adult patients. A literature search was performed using PubMed (MEDLINE), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus. Using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, seven relevant articles were obtained.Results The incidence of fever of all origins (both known and unknown) after SCI ranged from 22.5 to 71.7% with a mean incidence of 50.6% and a median incidence of 50.0%. The incidence of fever of unknown origin (neurogenic fever) ranged from 2.6 to 27.8% with a mean incidence of 8.0% and a median incidence of 4.7%. Cervical and thoracic spinal injuries were more commonly associated with fever than lumbar injuries. In addition, complete injuries had a higher incidence of fever than incomplete injuries. The pathogenesis of neurogenic fever after acute SCI is not thoroughly understood.Conclusion Neurogenic fevers are relatively common following an acute SCI; however, there is little in the scientific literature to help physicians prevent or treat this condition. The paucity of research underscored by this review demonstrates the need for further studies with larger sample sizes, focusing on incidence rate, clinical outcomes, and pathogenesis of neurogenic fever following acute traumatic SCI.",systematic_review

Abstract: SummaryBackgroundThe recent Ebola epidemic has increased public awareness of the risk of travel associated viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF). International preparedness to manage imported cases Ebola virus infection was inadequate, highlighted by cases of nosocomial transmission. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a re-emerging tick-borne VHF centred in the Eurasian region, affecting a large geographical area and with human-to-human transmission reported, especially in the healthcare setting.ObjectivesTo systematically review the characteristics of travel associated Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.MethodsA systematic review of travel-associated cases of CCHF was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement protocol. PubMed, SCOPUS, Science Citation Index (SCI) and ProMED databases were searched for reports published between January 1960 and January 2016. Three independent reviewers selected and reviewed studies and extracted data.Results21 cases of travel associated CCHF were identified, of which 12 died (3 outcome unknown) and 4 secondary (nosocomial) infections were reported. Risk occupations or activities for CCHF infection were reported in 8/12 cases when data were available. Travel from Asia to Asia occurred in 9 cases, Africa to Africa occurred in 5 cases, Africa to Europe in 3 cases, Asia to Europe in 2 cases and Europe to Europe in 2 cases.ConclusionCCHF related to travel is rare, is generally associated with at risk activities/occupation and is frequently fatal. Key to early diagnosis and prevention of nosocomial transmission is an understanding of CCHF risk factors and the geographical distribution of CCHF.",systematic_review

Abstract: IntroductionIn 5%–10% of patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), colchicine is not effective in preventing inflammatory attacks. Another 5%–10% of patients are intolerant to effective doses of colchicine and experience serious side effects. Treatment with anti-interleukin-1 (IL-1) drugs may be an alternative for these patients, although it is not reimbursed for this indication in many countries.MethodsWe systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for reports of anti-IL-1 treatment in FMF patients.ResultsOut of 284 potentially relevant articles, 27 eligible reports were identified and included in the data analysis.ConclusionA complete response to therapy without a single attack during treatment was reported in 76.5% of patients on anakinra treatment and in 67.5% of patients during canakinumab treatment. In patients with established type AA amyloidosis, anti-IL-1 treatment can reverse proteinuria. Anti-IL-1 therapy seems to be a safe and effective alternative for patients with FMF who do not respond to or cannot tolerate colchicine.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundThere is a significant global health burden associated with acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD), especially in developing countries. ARF and RHD most often strike children and young adults living in impoverished settings, where unhygienic conditions and lack of awareness and knowledge of streptococcal infection progression are common. Secondary prophylactic measures have been recommended in the past, but primary prevention measures have been gaining more attention from researchers frustrated by the perpetual prevalence of ARF and RHD in developing countries. Health education aims to empower people to take responsibility for their own well-being by gaining control over the underlying factors that influence health. We therefore conducted a review of the current best evidence for the use of health education interventions to increase awareness and knowledge of streptococcal pharyngitis and ARF.Methods and designThis article describes the protocol for a systematic review of the effectiveness of health education interventions aimed at increasing awareness and knowledge of the symptoms, causes and consequences of streptococcal pharyngitis, rheumatic fever and/or rheumatic heart disease. Studies will be selected in which the effect of an intervention is compared with either a pre-intervention or a control, targeting all possible audience types. Primary and secondary outcomes of interest are pre-specified. Randomized controlled trials, quasi-randomized trials, controlled before–after studies and controlled clinical trials will be considered.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundDengue fever in renal transplanted patients has not been studied well, and we review all the literature about episodes dengue fever in renal transplant patients.MethodsThe aim was to describe clinico-pathological characteristics, immunosuppressive protocols, need renal outcome and mortality. PubMed, LILACS, Google Scholar and Research Gate were searched for “Dengue” and “Renal/Kidney Transplantation” with no date limits. Hits were analyzed by two researchers separately.ResultsFever, myalgia, arthralgia and headache was significantly lower than normal population, while pleural effusions and ascites were observed more. Incidence of severe dengue is significantly higher among transplant patients in this review, as well as they had a significantly higher mortality (8.9% vs 3.7%, p = 0.031). Age, period after transplantation and immunosuppressive profile had no effect on disease severity, mortality or graft out come. Presence of new bleeding complications and ascites was associated with more severe disease (p < 0.001 and p = 0.005), death (p = 0.033) or graft loss (p = 0.035). Use of tacrolimus was associated with new bleeding complications (p = 0.027), and with ascites (p = 0.021), but not with thrombocytopenia. 25% of patients with primary disease fail to mount an IgG response by 15 weeks of the illness. 58.9% had graft dysfunction during illness. Postoperative transplanted patients were at risk of severe disease and unfavorable outcome.ConclusionsThe physical and laboratory findings in dengue fever in renal transplanted patients differ from the general population. Some degree of graft dysfunction is common during the illness, but only a minority develops graft failure.",systematic_review

Abstract: ObjectivesNumerous studies have reported the epidemiological and clinical features of Malta fever incidence in Iran. Review and synthesis of the related literature through meta-analysis can provide an appropriate measurement for aforementioned indices. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the epidemiological and clinical features of people with Malta fever in Iran.MethodsThe required documents were obtained through searching national and international databases. In each study, standard deviation of the indices was calculated using binomial distribution formulas. Finally, the heterogeneity index was determined between studies using Cochran (Q) and I2 tests.ResultsCombining the results of 47 articles in the meta-analysis indicated that 57.6% (55.02–60.1%) and 42.3% (49.8–44.9%) of the patients were male and female, respectively. Most of the patients lived in rural areas; 68.4% (63.6–73.2%) compared to 31.4% (26.7–36.3%). In addition, 20.8% (17.4–24.2%) of the patients were ranchers and farmers, 16.9% (14.5–19.4%) were students, and 31.6% (27–36.2%) were housewives. Of the patients studies, 50.5% (35.6–65.2%) experienced contact with animals and 57.1% (46.4–67.9%) used unpasteurized dairy products. Fever, joint pain, and sweating were detected among 65.7% (53.7–77.8%) and 55.3% (44.4–66.2%), respectively.ConclusionThe present study revealed that the frequency of male patients with brucellosis was considerably more than that of female patients.

Abstract: BackgroundAcute rheumatic fever is considered to be a heritable condition, but the magnitude of the genetic effect is unknown. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of twin studies of concordance of acute rheumatic fever in order to derive quantitative estimates of the size of the genetic effect.MethodsWe searched PubMed/MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, EMBASE, and Google Scholar from their inception to 31 January 2011, and bibliographies of retrieved articles, for twin studies of the concordance for acute rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease in monozygotic versus dizygotic twins that used accepted diagnostic criteria for acute rheumatic fever and zygosity without age, gender or language restrictions. Twin similarity was measured by probandwise concordance rate and odds ratio (OR), and aggregate probandwise concordance risk was calculated by combining raw data from each study. ORs from separate studies were combined by random-effects meta-analysis to evaluate association between zygosity status and concordance. Heritability was estimated by fitting a variance components model to the data.Results435 twin pairs from six independent studies met the inclusion criteria. The pooled probandwise concordance risk for acute rheumatic fever was 44% in monozygotic twins and 12% in dizygotic twins, and the association between zygosity and concordance was strong (OR 6.39; 95% confidence interval, 3.39 to 12.06; P<0.001), with no significant study heterogeneity (P = 0.768). The estimated heritability across all the studies was 60%.ConclusionsAcute rheumatic fever is an autoimmune disorder with a high heritability.",systematic_review

Abstract: Aim To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to establish if fever is associated with primary tooth eruption.Materials and methods Literature searches involved Pubmed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane. The potentially relevant studies had the full text analyzed. Only studies concerning fever during eruption period of primary tooth in humans were included. Papers in non-English language, and papers that included syndromic patients or patients with any disease were excluded. The meta-analyses were performed with Review Manager (version 5.3). Only studies that reported the results as dichotomous data were analyzed with Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test in meta-analysis function of Review Manager 5.3. The fixed-effects model was used to evaluate the association between tooth eruption and fever.Results Search identified 83 potential studies. After exclusion of the duplicated studies, or were not related to the criteria of inclusion only 6 studies were selected for the systematic review. In the overall meta-analysis, no association was found [OR = 1.32 (0.88-1.96)] between fever and primary tooth eruption. However, in the subgroup analysis, when the method used to measure fever was the rectal temperature there was an association [OR = 2.82 (1.55-5.14)] between fever and primary tooth eruption.Conclusion There are few suitable studies in the literature regarding the association between primary tooth eruption and fever. However, our study found an association between fever and primary tooth eruption only when rectal temperature was performedHow to cite this article Nemezio MA, De Oliveira KMH, Romualdo PC, Queiroz AM, Paula-e-Silva FWG, Silva RAB, Kuchler EC.",systematic_review

Abstract: Background:Optimal delivery of regular benzathine penicillin G (BPG) injections pre-scribed as secondary prophylaxis for acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is vital to preventing disease morbidity and cardiac sequelae in affected pediatric and young adult popu-lations. However, poor uptake of secondary prophylaxis remains a significant challenge to ARF/RHD control programs.Objective:In order to facilitate better understanding of this challenge and thereby identify means to improve service delivery, this systematic literature review explored rates of adherence and factors asso-ciated with adherence to secondary prophylaxis for ARF and RHD worldwide.Methods:MEDLINE was searched for relevant primary studies published in the English language from 1994-2014, and a search of reference lists of eligible articles was performed. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using a modified assessment tool.Results:Twenty studies were included in the review. There was a range of adherence to varying regi-mens of secondary prophylaxis reported globally, and a number of patient demographic, clinical, socio-cultural and health care service delivery factors associated with adherence to secondary prophylaxis were identified.Conclusion:Insights into factors associated with lower and higher adherence to secondary prophylaxis may be utilized to facilitate improved delivery of secondary prophylaxis for ARF and RHD. Strategies may include ensuring an effective active recall system, providing holistic care, involving community health workers and delivering ARF/RHD health education.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundMany parents consider fever a disease in itself and feel disempowered when their child is ill. Numerous guidelines have been produced; however, their target audience remains healthcare professionals and not carers of children in general. A reliable source of information will decrease worry in parents and carers when managing a febrile child.Methods/DesignA systematic search will be conducted in nine electronic databases. Articles published in English, or with an abstract published in English, will be eligible for inclusion in the review. Unpublished literature, grey literature and consultation with experts in the area will be used to supplement database searching. Titles and abstracts of studies will be screened for inclusion in the study by two independent reviewers against pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A data extraction form will be designed and data will be extracted to provide detail of the included studies by a further two reviewers. Quality assessment of studies will be conducted by two additional independent reviewers and results will be used to moderate included studies. All disagreements will be resolved through discussion until consensus is reached. Thematic synthesis will be used to analyse results.DiscussionCorrect management of fever in children is not well understood in the general population. Although carers can identify fever and febrile illness in children, determination of the severity of fever proves challenging.

Abstract: BackgroundPostoperative cough is a prevalent complication in lung resection patients, exacerbating postoperative pain, impairing sleep and communication, and thereby reducing overall quality of life. Early identification of high-risk patients and targeted preventive measures are essential to reduce cough frequency, alleviate symptoms, facilitate recovery, and enhance quality of life. This study aimed to develop a predictive model to identify patients at risk of persistent cough following pulmonary resection.MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to identify risk factors associated with persistent cough after pulmonary resection. In the predictive model, the natural logarithm of the pooled risk estimate for each factor was used as a coefficient to assign risk prediction scores. Data from 294 patients who underwent pulmonary resection between October and December 2024 were used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the model.ResultsThe meta-analysis included 13 studies with 3,669 patients who underwent pulmonary resection, of whom 1,115 developed postoperative chronic cough. Seven significant predictors of persistent cough were identified: lobectomy, right-sided surgery, right upper lobectomy, subcarinal lymph node dissection, lymph node dissection around the bronchial tree, tracheal intubation time (≥172 min), and postoperative acid reflux. The model was validated using logistic regression analysis with an external cohort, yielding an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 (95% confidence interval: 0.82–0.91).",systematic_review

Literature was screened across five databases using Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) strategy, keywords, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. The remaining literature was evaluated using a quality appraisal tool checklist. This review includes systematic reviews, ‎‎meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, cross-sectional studies, and articles ‎without ‎a defined ‎methodology section. This review suggests that honey is effective in treating children above 12 months of age, while cold and cough medications (CCMs) are safe if administered at therapeutic doses. Since fatalities can occur in children under two years of age, further RCT studies on CCMs are required to establish safety across all age groups.",systematic_review

Abstract: AbstractStudies have shown that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are superior in primary and secondary prevention for cardiac mortality and morbidity to angiotensin receptor blocker (ARBs). One of the common side effects from ACEI is dry cough. The aims of this systematic review, and network meta‐analysis are to rank the risk of cough induced by different ACEIs and between ACEI and placebo, ARB or calcium channel blockers (CCB). We performed a systematic review, and network meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials to rank the risk of cough induced by each ACEI and between ACEI and placebo, ARB or CCB. A total of 135 RCTs with 45,420 patients treated with eleven ACEIs were included in the analyses. The pooled estimated relative risk (RR) between ACEI and placebo was 2.21 (95% CI: 2.05–2.39). ACEI had more incidences of cough than ARB (RR 3.2; 95% CI: 2.91, 3.51), and pooled estimated of RR between ACEI and CCB was 5.30 (95% CI: 4.32–6.50) Moexipril ranked as number one for inducing cough (SUCRA 80.4%) and spirapril ranked the least (SUCRA 12.3%). The order for the rest of the ACEIs are as follows: ramipril (SUCRA 76.4%), fosinopril (SUCRA 72.5%), lisinopril (SUCRA 64.7%), benazepril (SUCRA 58.6%), quinapril (SUCRA 56.5%), perindopril (SUCRA 54.1%), enalapril (SUCRA 49.7%), trandolapril (SUCRA 44.6%) and, captopril (SUCRA 13.7%). All ACEI has the similar risk of developing a cough. ACEI should be avoided in patients who have risk of developing cough, and an ARB or CCB is an alternative based on the patient's comorbidity.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundPostoperative cough (POC) is a common complication following pulmonary resection, with an incidence of 25–50%. However, it often receives insufficient attention from clinicians. This study aimed to systematically identify the key risk factors associated with POC in lung cancer survivors and to develop and validate a predictive model to assess the likelihood of POC following pulmonary resection.MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted by searching PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, WANFANG DATA, and CNKI to identify relevant risk factors for POC. Additionally, a cohort of 5,570 patients who underwent pulmonary resection was used to develop and validate the predictive model. Statistically significant independent variables from the meta-analysis were incorporated into the model, with risk factors weighted based on their pooled odds ratios (ORs) and β-coefficients. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA).ResultsThe meta-analysis included 23 cohorts with 5,360 patients, of whom 33.8% experienced POC. Significant risk factors identified were age ≥60 years, body mass index (BMI) <24 kg/m2, preoperative cough, right lung surgery, lobectomy, subcarinal and peritracheal lymph node dissection, postoperative acid reflux, and preoperative respiratory training. The predictive model demonstrated robust performance, with AUCs of 0.772 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.757–0.786] in the training cohort and 0.782 (95% CI: 0.761–0.803) in the validation cohort.",systematic_review

Abstract: IntroductionValidated and reliable patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are recommended to assess the severity and impact of cough in interstitial lung disease (ILD). We systematically reviewed the literature to identify PROMs for cough in ILD, examining their psychometric properties.MethodsWe searched four databases from inception to 10 January 2025. English-language original articles that described the use of a PROM to measure cough in adults with ILD and addressed the psychometric properties, method of administration or results of usability testing were selected.Results21 PROMs were evaluated in 35 studies, including 14 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and seven in other ILDs, eight cough-specific PROMs, and 13 disease-specific PROMs with a domain for cough. No tool had sufficient evidence for more than 5/7 of the psychometric properties evaluated. There was evidence for content validity for four PROMs in IPF (A Tool to Assess Quality of Life in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (ATAQ-IPF), the Cough and Sputum Assessment Questionnaire (CASA-Q), Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms: COPD (E-RS™:COPD) and the Living with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Questionnaire (L-IPF)). Only one study evaluated convergent validity using objective cough monitoring, demonstrating high validity for the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) (r=−0.74– −0.80) and cough visual analogue scale (VAS) (r=0.80). Acceptable internal consistency (α>0.7) was demonstrated for 10 PROMs (ATAQ-IPF, the Cross-Atlantic modification of ATAQ-IPF, the Chinese version of ATAQ-IPF, CASA-Q, E-RS™:COPD, LCQ, L-IPF, the IPF-specific version of St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), the modified version of the Edmonton System Assessment System and SGRQ).",systematic_review

Abstract: IntroductionAzithromycin is an effective treatment for various respiratory conditions but its effect on cough is poorly understood. We synthesised data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and noncomparative studies (NCT) examining its effect on objective and subjective cough.MethodsAfter prospective registration on PROSPERO, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL for both RCTs and NCT trials examining the effect azithromycin on cough in respiratory disease.ResultsWe identified 1240 studies of which 6 (4 RCTs and 2 NCT studies) were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of 275 patients. Azithromycin was associated with significant improvement in Leicester Cough Questionnaire scores at follow-up when compared to baseline scores (SMD = 0.62 [95% CI 0.12 to 1.12], p = 0.01). However, when only RCTs were synthesised, no significant effect was observed (SMD = 0.12 [95% CI − 0.36 to 0.60], p = 0.62). There was no significant reduction in cough severity VAS score (SMD = − 0.39 [95% CI − 0.92 to 0.14], p = 0.15). There was no significant reduction in objective cough count (SMD = − 0.41 [95% CI − 1.04 to 0.32], p = 0.09).ConclusionAzithromycin therapy improves cough-related quality of life in various chronic respiratory diseases; however, there was no significant effect on cough outcomes when only data from RCTs were synthesised.",systematic_review

Abstract: PurposeRecent evidence suggests a global burden of chronic cough in general populations. However, the definitions vary greatly among epidemiological studies, and none have been validated for clinical relevance. We aimed to examine previous epidemiological definitions in detail and explore the operational characteristics.MethodsA systematic review was conducted for epidemiological surveys that reported the prevalence of chronic cough in general adult populations during the years 1980 to 2013. A literature search was performed on Pubmed and Embase without language restriction. Epidemiological definitions for chronic cough were classified according to their components, such as cutoff duration. Meta-analyses were performed for the male-to-female ratio of chronic cough prevalence to explore operational characteristics of epidemiological definitions.ResultsA total of 70 studies were included in the systematic review. The most common epidemiological definition was identified as 'cough ≥3 months' duration without specification of phlegm (n=50); however, it conflicted with the cutoff duration in current clinical guidelines (cough ≥8 weeks). Meta-analyses were performed for the male-to-female ratio of chronic cough among 28 studies that reported sex-specific prevalence using the most common definition. The pooled male-to-female odds ratio was 1.26 (95% confidence interval 0.92-1.73) with significant heterogeneity (I2=96%, P<0.001), which was in contrast to clinical observations of female predominance from specialist clinics. Subgroup analyses did not reverse the ratio or reduce the heterogeneity.ConclusionsThis study identified major issues in defining chronic cough in future epidemiological studies.",systematic_review

Abstract: SummaryBackgroundRefractory chronic cough (RCC) has a significant impact on patient’s health-related quality of life and represents a challenge in clinical management. However, the optimal treatment for RCC remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate and compare the efficacy and safety of the current pharmacological therapeutic options for RCC.MethodsA systematic review was performed by searching PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Ovid databases from January 1, 2008 to March 1, 2023. All randomised control trials (RCTs) reporting outcomes of efficacy or/and safety were included in the Bayesian network meta-analysis. Here, we compared the effects on Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and objective cough frequency of patients with RCC. Besides, we also compared the incidence of adverse events (AEs) for analysis of safety. PROSPERO registration: CRD42022345940.Findings19 eligible RCTs included 3326 patients and 7 medication categories: P2X3 antagonist, GABA modulator, Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) modulator, NK-1 agonist, opioid analgesic, macrolide, and sodium cromoglicate. Compared with placebo, mean difference (MD) of LCQ and 24 h cough frequency for P2X3 antagonist relief were 1.637 (95% CI: 0.887–2.387) and −11.042 (P = 0.035). Compared with placebo, effect sizes (MD for LCQ and cough severity VAS) for GABA modulator were 1.347 (P = 0.003) and −7.843 (P = 0.003). In the network meta-analysis, gefapixant is the most effective treatment for patients with RCC (The Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curves (SUCRA) is 0.711 in LCQ, 0.983 in 24 h cough frequency, and 0.786 in cough severity VAS).

Eliapixant and lesogaberan had better efficacy than placebo in cough severity VAS. However, TRP modulator had worse efficacy than placebo. In the meta-analysis of AEs, the present study found P2X3 antagonist had a significant correlation to AEs (RR: 1.129, 95% CI: 1.012–1.259), especially taste-related AEs (RR: 6.216, P < 0.05).InterpretationIn this network meta-analysis, P2X3 antagonist showing advantages in terms of efficacy is currently the most promising medication for treatment of RCC. GABA modulator also showed potential efficacy for RCC but with AEs of the central system. Nevertheless, the role of TRP modulator needed to be revisited. Further research is needed to determine the potential beneficiary population for optimizing the pharmacological management of chronic cough.Funding10.13039/501100001809National Natural Science Foundation of China (81870079), Guangdong Science and Technology Project (2021A050520012), Incubation Program of 10.13039/501100014219National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars (GMU2020-207).",systematic_review

Abstract: ObjectivesTo systematically review the effects of dezocine (DZC) on the occurrence rate and severity of opioid-induced cough (OIC).DesignSystematic review and meta-analysisData sourcesPubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Ovid, Web of Science as well as Chinese BioMedical Literature & Retrieval System, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang and VIP Data were searched from 1978 to 31 December 2020.Inclusion criteriaAll randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing DZC with placebo on the occurrence rate and severity of OIC.Data analysisAll data were analysed by using RevMan V.5.3. Each outcome was tested for heterogeneity, and randomised-effects or fixed-effects model was used in the presence or absence of significant heterogeneity.ResultsOur search yielded 33 RCTs including 4442 patients, and 2521 patients were allocated into the DZC group and 1921 into the control group. Fentanyl was administrated in 1880 patients and sufentanil in 2562 patients during the induction of general anaesthesia. The meta-analysis demonstrated that DZC significantly reduced the occurrence rate of OIC induced by either fentanyl (8.8% vs 49.7%, OR=0.07, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.12, p<0.00001) or sufentanil (5.0% vs 41.5%, OR=0.07, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.12, p<0.00001). The meta-analysis also indicated that the occurrence rate of mild, moderate and severe OIC in the DZC group was remarkably lower than that of the control group (mild: 3.6% vs 13.6%, OR=0.19, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.25, p<0.00001; moderate: 2.0% vs 13.6%, OR=0.12, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.18, p<0.00001; severe: 1.0% vs 13.9%, OR=0.08, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.12, p<0.00001).",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundThe extent to which objective and subjective tools has been used to measure the characteristics and burden of cough in patients with asthma has not been reported.ObjectiveTo review the large and extensive body of literature in asthma with the specific hypothesis that the characteristics of cough and clinical impact in this disease has only occasionally been studied.MethodsFor this systematic review, we searched EMBASE and MEDLINE databases using a combination of MeSH terms for “cough” and “asthma” for studies published up to and including end of August 2021. Studies included for analysis were confined to those undertaken in adult patients (≥ 18 years) with asthma of any severity where any tool or method to specifically measure cough was employed.ResultsOf 12,090 citations identified after our initial search, 112 full-text articles met criteria for inclusion in our analysis. We found that a broad range of objective and subjective measures have been used albeit with a lack of consistency between studies. Clinically important levels of cough associated with impaired health status were identified in patients with asthma.ConclusionAlthough cough is a common symptom in asthma, the clinical features and accompanying healthcare burden have been studied infrequently. In studies where cough was measured, the methods employed varied considerably.

Abstract: Chinese herbal medicine has been commonly used in the treatment of postinfectious cough. The aim of this review is to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine for postinfectious cough. An extensive search for RCTs was performed using multiple electronic databases, supplemented with a manual search. All studies included were confirmed with specific inclusion criteria. Methodological quality of each study was examined according to the Cochrane risk of bias assessment. Quality of evidence was evaluated using rating approach developed by GRADE working group. The literature search yielded 352 results, of which 12 RCTs satisfied the inclusion criteria, offering moderate-to-high levels of evidence. Methodological quality was considered high in three trials, while in the other nine studies the unclear risk of bias was in the majority. Findings suggested that, compared with western conventional medicine or placebo, Chinese herbal medicine could effectively improve core symptoms of postinfectious cough, act better and have earlier antitussive effect, and enhance patients' quality of life.

Abstract: AbstractObjectivesCough occurring in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) was first described in 1935 and is a frequently discussed symptom on patient forums. We aimed to systematically review the available evidence to explore the prevalence and risk factors for persistent cough in patients diagnosed with RCC to establish whether cough could be a presenting symptom of RCC.DesignThis epidemiological systematic review used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement 2020.Data sourcesMedline, Embase, Science Citation Index, The Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO trials register were searched without language restrictions until 1 June 2023.Eligibility criteria for selecting studiesWe included articles of all study designs reporting cough in patients (18 years or older) with RCC attributed to the disease itself or to treatment.Data extraction and synthesisData from included articles was extracted using a preprepared and piloted form, and quality assessment was conducted independently by two authors. The risk of bias was assessed in studies other than case reports or case series using the critical appraisal instrument for studies reporting prevalence data. Narrative techniques were used for data analysis and, where appropriate, meta-analysis using a fixed-effects model was performed.ResultsOf 509 studies screened, 105 full-text articles were assessed, with 46 papers subsequently excluded, resulting in 59 analysed in depth. There were 105 patients with RCC reported as having a cough due to the disease itself within 30 case reports and 8 case series.

Abstract: BackgroundOpioid-induced cough (OIC) is a common side effect during anesthetic induction. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ketamine/esketamine in preventing OIC during anesthetic induction.MethodsWe systematically searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from inception through December 2024 for randomized controlled trials that examined the efficacy of ketamine/esketamine in preventing OIC (Registration: INPLASY2024120102). Studies were included if they: (1) evaluated surgical patients receiving short-acting opioids (e.g., fentanyl) during anesthetic induction; (2) compared ketamine or esketamine against placebo/no treatment; and (3) reported OIC incidence. Studies were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed using risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The primary outcome was the overall incidence of OIC within 3 min after opioids administration.ResultsTwelve trials involving ketamine (nine trials) and esketamine (three trials) were analyzed. Notably, both agents significantly reduced the overall incidence of OIC compared to placebo (RR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.22–0.41; p < 0.00001, I2 = 61%, moderate certainty). All studies demonstrated low risk of bias across all domains for primary outcome. These agents also demonstrated efficacy against mild cough (RR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.28–0.59, high certainty) and moderate-to-severe cough (RR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.18–0.38, moderate certainty).",systematic_review

However, given the short delay in cough onset and mild improvements in oxygen saturation, the clinical significance of these findings may be limited in routine practice. Their use may be most beneficial in selected patients at risk of OIC-related complications.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatments are often prescribed based on individuals' pattern diagnoses. A systematic review of Chinese and English literatures on TCM pattern differentiation, treatment principle, and pattern-based treatment for insomnia has therefore been conducted. A total of 227 studies, 17916 subjects, and 87 TCM patterns were analyzed. There was a limited consistency in pattern-based TCM treatment of insomnia across practitioners. Except for Gui Pi Tang, An Shen Ding Zhi Wan, and Wen Dan Tang which were used more commonly for deficiency of both the heart and spleen, internal disturbance of phlegm-heat, and qi deficiency of the heart and gallbladder, respectively, the selection of herbal formula for other patterns and pattern-based prescription of individual herbs and acupoints were not consistent. Suanzaoren (Semen Z. spinosae), Fuling (Poria), Yejiaoteng (Caulis P. multiflori), Gancao (Radix Glycyrrhizae), Baishao (Radix P. alba), Shenmen (HT7), Yintang (EX-HN3), Sanyinjiao (SP6), Baihui (GV20), Anmian (EX-HN22), and Sishencong (EX-HN1) were commonly used, but nonspecifically for many patterns. Treatment principles underlying herb and acupoint selection were seldom reported. Although many studies were reviewed, the study quality and diagnostic process were inadequate. More high quality studies are needed to examine the additional benefits of pattern differentiation and pattern-based TCM treatment.",systematic_review

Abstract: Aim:This sudy aims to investigate the association between insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).Methods:We searched published studies indexed in MEDLINE and EMBASE database from inception to December 2015. Studies that reported odds ratios (ORs), risk ratios, hazard ratios or standardized incidence ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI) comparing the risk of NAFLD among participants who had insomnia or EDS versus those without insomnia or EDS were included. Pooled ORs and 95% CI were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. Cochran's Q test and I2 statistic were used to determine the between-study heterogeneity.Results:Our search strategy yielded 2117 potentially relevant articles (781 articles from MEDLINE and 1336 articles from EMBASE). After comprehensive review, seven studies (three cross-sectional studies and four case–control studies) were found to be eligible and were included in the meta-analysis. The risk of NAFLD in participants who had insomnia was significantly higher with the pooled OR of 1.13 (95% CI, 1.00–1.27). The statistical heterogeneity was moderate with an I2 of 62%. Elevated risk of NAFLD was also observed among participants with EDS even though the 95% CI was wider and did not reach statistical significance (pooled OR 2.21; 95% CI, 0.84–5.82). The statistical heterogeneity was moderate with an I2 of 62%.Conclusions:Our study demonstrated an increased risk of NAFLD among participants who had insomnia or EDS. Whether this association is causal needs further investigations.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundPrimary insomnia is a common health issue in the modern world. We conducted a systematic review of the auricular therapy, aiming to evaluate whether there are advantages of auricular acupuncture with seed or pellet attachments for the treatment of primary insomnia.MethodsA search of relevant literatures was performed on major medical databases, including Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CBM, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang Data and so on. Risk of bias evaluation, meta-analysis, sensitivity analysis and evidence rating of all extracted information were conducted also.ResultsA total of 1381 records were identified, with 15 studies deemed eligible for the present review. Meta-analyses were conducted in two comparisons separately: participants received auricular acupuncture were more likely to make an improvement in clinical effective rate (RR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.83), sleep duration (MD = 56.46, 95% CI 45.61 to 67.31), sleep efficiency(MD = 12.86, 95% CI 9.67 to 16.06), global score on PSQI (MD = -3.41, 95% CI -3.93 to -2.89), number of awakenings( MD = -3.27, 95% CI -6.30 to -0.25) and sleep onset latency(MD = -10.35, 95% CI -14.37 to -6.33) when compared to sham auricular acupuncture or placebo; while in auricular acupuncture VS medications comparison, a better effective rate (RR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.34), better sleep efficiency(MD = 21.44, 95% CI 16.30 to 26.58), lower PSQI score (MD = -3.62, 95% CI -4.59 to -2.65) and less adverse effect (RR = 0.11, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.26) can be seen also in auricular acupuncture group.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundInsomnia is the common complaint among patients with stroke. Acupuncture has increasingly been used for insomnia relief after stroke.The aim of the present study was to summarize and evaluate evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture in relieving insomnia after stroke.MethodsSeven databases were searched from inception through October 2014 without language restrictions. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included if acupuncture was compared to placebo or other conventional therapy for treatment of insomnia after stroke. Assessments were performed using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), the insomnia severity index (ISI), the Athens insomnia scale (AIS), and the efficacy standards of Chinese medicine.ResultsA total of 165 studies were identified; 13 RCTs met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that acupuncture appeared to be more effective than drugs for treatment of insomnia after stroke, as assessed by the PSQI (weighted mean difference, 4.31; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.67–6.95; P = 0.001) and by the efficacy standards of Chinese medicine (risk ratio, 1.25; 95 % CI, 1.12–1.40; P < 0.001). Intradermal acupuncture had significant effects compared with sham acupuncture, as assessed by the ISI (weighted mean difference, 4.44; 95 % CI, 2.75–6.13; P < 0.001) and the AIS (weighted mean difference, 3.64; 95 % CI, 2.28–5.00; P < 0.001).ConclusionsOur results suggest that acupuncture could be effective for treating insomnia after stroke. However, further studies are needed to confirm the role of acupuncture in the treatment of this disorder.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12906-016-1220-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",systematic_review

Abstract: A systematic review was conducted to examine traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) patterns commonly diagnosed in subjects with insomnia and clinical features associated with the TCM patterns, and an insomnia symptom checklist for TCM diagnostic purpose was developed based on the review. Two independent researchers searched the China Academic Journals Full-Text Database and 10 English databases. A total of 103 studies and 9499 subjects were analyzed. There was a wide variation in terminology relating to symptomatology and TCM pattern. We identified 69 patterns, with the top 3 patterns (i.e., deficiency of both the heart and spleen, hyperactivity of fire due to yin deficiency, and liver-qi stagnation transforming into fire) and the top 10 patterns covering 51.8% and 77.4% of the 9499 subjects, respectively. There were 19 sleep-related, 92 non-sleep-related, 14 tongue, and 7 pulse features included as diagnostic criteria of the top 10 TCM patterns for insomnia. Excessive dreaming, dizziness, red tongue, and fine pulse were the most common sleep-related, non-sleep-related, tongue, and pulse features. Overlapping symptomatology between the TCM patterns was present. A standardized symptom checklist consisted of 92 items, including 13 sleep-related, 61 non-sleep-related, 11 tongue, and 7 pulse items, holds promise as a diagnostic tool and merits further validation.",systematic_review

Abstract: Individuals with cancer are disproportionately affected by sleep disturbance and insomnia relative to the general population. These problems can be a consequence of the psychological, behavioral, and physical effects of a cancer diagnosis and treatment. Insomnia often persists for years and, when combined with already high levels of cancer-related distress, may place cancer survivors at a higher risk of future physical and mental health problems and poorer quality of life. The recommended first-line treatment for insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), a non-pharmacological treatment that incorporates cognitive and behavior-change techniques and targets dysfunctional attitudes, beliefs, and habits involving sleep. This article presents a comprehensive review of the literature examining the efficacy of CBT-I on sleep and psychological outcomes in cancer patients and survivors. The search revealed 12 studies (four uncontrolled, eight controlled) that evaluated the effects of CBT-I in cancer patients or survivors. Results suggest that CBT-I is associated with statistically and clinically significant improvements in subjective sleep outcomes in patients with cancer. CBT-I may also improve mood, fatigue, and overall quality of life, and can be successfully delivered through a variety of treatment modalities, making it possible to reach a broader range of patients who may not have access to more traditional programs. Future research in this area should focus on the translation of evidence into clinical practice in order to increase awareness and access to effective insomnia treatment in cancer care.",systematic_review

Abstract: Introduction Sleep related disorders affect around 30% of people all over the world, and evidence shows that 10% require therapeutic intervention. Insomnia represents the most common disturbance of sleep, defined as the experience of poor sleep for at least 1 month. Most of primary insomnia can be prevented by a proper lifestyle and sleep hygiene rules. Regardless, hypnotic drugs and widely prescribed, and most times, long-term used, which is not recommended because of its negative side effects.ObjectivesReview the scientific evidence about effectiveness of plant extracts for insomnia, natural products with practically no side-effects, and thus be possible to reduce or even avoid the use of hypnotic drugs.MethodsThe Medline database through the Pubmed search engine was used with the following keywords: “insomnia” and “herbal compounds”.ResultsValerian activity on sleep disturbances has been attributed to the presence of isovaleric acids and valepotriates with reported calming action and GABA reuptake inhibition with sedative effects. Considering the data presented in the literature, despite controversial and conflicting, several studies showed that valerian (160-600mg/day) improved sleep quality and reduced sleep latency and duration; also valerian seems more effective for chronic insomnia than acute episodes.Hop has different properties: calming, sleep inducing, gastric secretion stimulating and spasmolytic.Increasing GABAergic activity seems to be the main mechanism of action, thus inhibiting the central nervous system and also has demonstrated binding affinities to some of the melatonin and serotonin receptor.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundInsomnia is a widespread human health problem, but there currently are the limitations of conventional therapies available. Suanzaoren decoction (SZRD) is a well known classic Chinese herbal prescription for insomnia and has been treating people’s insomnia for more than thousand years. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SZRD for insomnia.MethodsA systematic literature search was performed for 6 databases up to July of 2012 to identify randomized control trials (RCTs) involving SZRD for insomniac patients. The methodological quality of RCTs was assessed independently using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.ResultsTwelve RCTs with total of 1376 adult participants were identified. The methodological quality of all included trials are no more than 3/8 score. Majority of the RCTs concluded that SZRD was more significantly effective than benzodiazepines for treating insomnia. Despite these positive outcomes, there were many methodological shortcomings in the studies reviewed, including insufficient information about randomization generation and absence of allocation concealment, lack of blinding and no placebo control, absence of intention-to-treat analysis and lack of follow-ups, selective publishing and reporting, and small number of sample sizes. A number of clinical heterogeneity such as diagnosis, intervention, control, and outcome measures were also reviewed.",systematic_review

Secondary outcomes included sleep quality, total sleep time, time in bed, sleep onset latency, wake time after sleep onset, and number of nocturnal awakenings.Data SourcesWe searched PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, Embase, and the Web of Science for randomized trials.MethodsStudies were eligible if they were randomized controlled trials in adults that reported application of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia via internet delivery. Mean differences in improvement in sleep measures were calculated using the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method for random effects meta-analysis.ResultsWe found 15 trials, all utilizing a pretest-posttest randomized control group design. Sleep efficiency was 72% at baseline and improved by 7.2% (95% CI: 5.1%, 9.3%; p<0.001) with internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy versus control. Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy resulted in a decrease in the insomnia severity index by 4.3 points (95% CI: -7.1, -1.5; p = 0.017) compared to control.

Findings were organized into categories used in the treatment of childhood anxiety disorders, then applied to managing anxiety in the anaphylactic child. Results. Twenty-four relevant papers were identified. These varied widely in methodology. Findings emphasized included the need to distinguish anxiety-related and organic symptoms, ameliorate the anxiety-related impact of anaphylaxis on quality of life, and address parental anxiety about the child. Conclusion. Children with anaphylaxis can function well despite anxiety, but the physical, cognitive, and behavioral aspects of anxiety associated with anaphylactic risk must be addressed, and parents must be involved in care in constructive ways.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundStudies have shown that family members of patients in intensive care units experience high levels of anxiety. Contradictions in the results of the studies conducted regarding the effect of training on the anxiety level of such families, emphasize the necessity of employing other research methods to eliminate these ambiguities.ObjectiveThis study applied meta-analysis to determine the effect of training on the anxiety level of families with patients in the intensive care unit.MethodsIn order to find electronically published studies from 1990 to 2016, the articles published in journals indexed in the following databases were used: Elsevier, Scopus, ProQuest, ISI, Web of Science, PubMed, Google scholar and Cochrane. For data analysis Stata Software version 11 was used and the heterogeneity index of studies was determined through Cochran (Q) and I2. Due to the heterogeneity, the random effect model was used to estimate the difference between the standardized mean of anxiety.ResultsIn this meta-analysis and systematic review article, eight articles were found to be eligible. The number of samples in the initial studies into a meta-analysis included 387 patients in the intervention group and 393 people in the control group. Standardized difference of the mean anxiety score in the intervention group was −0.329 (CI 95%: −0.756–0.099) units less than that of the control group, indicating that this effect was not statistically significant.ConclusionsThe results of this meta-analysis show that training will decline the anxiety level of a family with patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, although the impact is not considerable.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundSocial anxiety is among the most prevalent and debilitating affective disturbances manifest in people with psychosis. It is usually accompanied by high levels of depression and leads to significant social disability, lower quality of life and poorer prognosis as it raises the possibility of an early relapse. Despite its elevated prevalence and severity in psychosis, social anxiety remains under-recognized and under-treated. Cognitive-behavioural therapy is recommended for the treatment of people with psychosis. However, its focus and evaluation has primarily revolved around the reduction of psychotic symptoms, and not for co-morbid affective disturbances such as social anxiety. There is lack of evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural interventions for the treatment of social anxiety disorder in psychosis.Methods/DesignElectronic databases will be systematically searched for randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies investigating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural interventions for the treatment of social anxiety disorder in people with psychosis.

Research including armed forces veterans and their family members will be included in the review with research including serving personnel or individuals under the age of 18 being excluded. Few RCTs examining the treatment of depression, anxiety, alcohol misuse or anger exist in armed forces veterans to date. The primary outcome will be symptomatic change following intervention for these difficulties. The secondary outcomes will include methodological aspects of interest such as discharge type and recruitment setting if data permits.

Abstract: AbstractBackground Interventions for depression among those with HIV/AIDS in Africa are being evaluated in increasing numbers. However, feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness have yet to be reviewed. We aimed to evaluate depression interventions performed in Africa for HIV infected adults.Methods Using key terms: depression, Africa, and HIV, we searched MEDLINE to identify depression interventions for adults with HIV in Africa. Women in the perinatal period were excluded. Data were extracted and the weighted relative change in depression scores for interventions and net effect over controls calculated.ResultsData were obtained from 18 articles (n = 1956 HIV-infected participants). Of those, 1358 received interventions and 558 were controls. Six of seven studies evaluating feasibility were positive vs. seven positive studies evaluating acceptability. Three studies investigated the use of psychotherapy (73% intervention decrease, 39% net decrease). Four studies investigated task-shifting of psychotherapy (47% intervention decrease, 34% net decrease). Three studies investigated antidepressants (79% intervention decrease, 39% net decrease). Three studies investigated task-shifting of antidepressant treatment (82% intervention decrease, 65% net decrease). An exercise intervention was evaluated (66% intervention decrease, 49% net decrease). One randomized trial investigated minocycline with insignificant results. Finally, three studies investigated other psychosocial interventions (44% intervention decrease, 21% net decrease).Conclusion Evaluation of 18 articles showed multiple interventions had high feasibility and acceptability for depression care in people with depression and HIV in Africa.",systematic_review

Abstract: This systematic review examines the efficacy of oral ginger for dysmenorrhea. Key biomedical databases and grey literature were searched. We included randomized controlled trials comparing oral ginger against placebo or active treatment in women with dysmenorrhea. Six trials were identified. Two authors independently reviewed the articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus with a third reviewer. We completed a narrative synthesis of all six studies and exploratory meta-analyses of three studies comparing ginger with placebo and two studies comparing ginger with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Ginger appeared more effective for reducing pain severity than placebo. The weighted mean difference on a 10 cm visual analogue scale was 1.55 cm (favoring ginger) (95% CI 0.68 to 2.43). No significant difference was found between ginger and mefenamic acid (an NSAID). The standardized mean difference was 0 (95% CI −0.40 to 0.41). Available data suggest that oral ginger could be an effective treatment for menstrual pain in dysmenorrhea. Findings, however, need to be interpreted with caution because of the small number of studies, poor methodological quality of the studies, and high heterogeneity across trials. The review highlights the need for future trials with high methodological quality.",systematic_review

Abstract: AimTo undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies to determine the effect of ginger supplementation on serum C-reactive protein (CRP), lipid profile, and glycaemia.MethodPubMed-MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Database, and Google Scholar databases were searched (up until July 2016) to identify prospective studies evaluating the impact of ginger supplementation on serum CRP. Random-effects model meta-analysis was used for quantitative data synthesis. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the leave-one-out method. Heterogeneity was quantitatively assessed using the I2 index. Systematic review registration: CRD42016035973.ResultsFrom a total of 265 entries identified via searches, 9 studies were included in the final selection. The meta-analysis indicated a significant reduction in serum CRP concentrations following ginger supplementation [weighted mean difference (WMD)−0.84 mg/L (95% CI −1.38 to −0.31, I2 56.3%)]. The WMD for fasting blood glucose and HbA1c was −1.35 mg/dl (95% CI −2.04 to −0.58, I2 12.1%) and −1.01 (95% CI −1.28 to −0.72, I2 9.4%), respectively. Moreover, high-density lipoprotein and triglyceride significantly improved after ginger administration [1.16 mg/dl (95% CI 0.52 to 1.08, I2 12.3%) and −1.63 mg/dl (95% CI −3.10 to −0.17, I2 8.1%), respectively]. These findings were robust in sensitivity analyses. Random-effects meta-regression revealed that changes in serum CRP levels were independent of the dosage of ginger supplementation (slope −0.20; 95% CI −0.95 to 0.55; p=0.60).ConclusionsThis meta-analysis suggests that ginger supplementation significantly reduces serum CRP and improves glycaemia indexes and lipid profile.",systematic_review

Abstract: AbstractGinger, the rhizome of Zingiber officinale, which is used as a spice globally has a long history of medicinal use that stimulates investigators to assess its potential roles as an adjuvant therapy or alternative medicine in a range of diseases. Anti‐inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor, and antiulcer effects of ginger have been proven in many scientific studies, and some of the ancient applications of ginger as a home remedy has been confirmed in human. In this review, we summarized the current evidence on the effects of ginger consumption on gastrointestinal disorders based on clinical trials. Our data indicate that divided lower daily dosage of 1500 mg ginger is beneficial for nausea relief. Because of limited number of studies on some other gastrointestinal disorders, the results may not be as much powered as to find significant results. Therefore, more extensive and well‐controlled human studies of ginger or its standard extracts are required to demonstrate its efficacy as a gastroprotective agent. Dose‐finding studies should be undertaken to accurately determine the effective dose and preparation of ginger in further clinical trials protocol.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundCardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which encompass a range of disorders impacting the heart and blood vessels, continue to pose a significant global public health challenge. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) has attracted attention among various treatment options for its potential advantages in promoting cardiovascular well-being. Renowned for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-hypertensive properties, ginger is a widely used culinary and medicinal plant. The objective of this research is to provide a comprehensive summary and systematic analysis of the existing scientific literature pertaining to the effects of ginger supplementation on glycemic profile, lipid profile, anthropometric measures, blood pressure, inflammatory markers, liver function tests, oxidative stress parameters, and adipokines. This analysis aims to establish a foundation for clinical interventions.MethodsA methodical electronic exploration will be carried out to discover articles in various databases such as Scopus, PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Web of Science. The search will specifically target randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that include both healthy and diseased individuals. Two evaluators will independently review articles, extract information, and evaluate the quality of the studies using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool (RoB 2). Any discrepancies will be addressed by involving a third reviewer. The quality of cumulative evidence will be evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria.",systematic_review

Abstract: AbstractBackground:Ancient medical practitioners used to encourage dietary supplements and herbal medicine for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Ginger (Zingiber officinale), is a nontoxic spice with negligible side effects, and is considered safe by the food and drug administration. In this analysis, we aimed to systematically compare fasting blood sugar (FBS) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at baseline versus at follow-up in T2DM patients who consumed and who did not consume ginger.Methods:A literature search was carried out through MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central, and www.ClinicalTrials.gov for English-published trials comparing glucose parameters in T2DM patients who were assigned to ginger consumption versus a control group. All the participants were patients with T2DM who were either assigned to ginger therapy (1600– 4000 mg daily) or to a control group. FBS and HbA1c were assessed in the ginger and control groups, respectively, from baseline to follow-up to observe any significant change. Weight mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated to represent the analysis which was carried out by the RevMan 5.3 software.Results:Eight randomized trials consisting of a total number of 454 participants with T2DM were included in this analysis. At first, FBS was compared in patients with T2DM from baseline prior to ginger consumption until follow-up after ginger consumption. The results showed no significant difference in FBS (WMD: 1.38, 95% CI: [−0.53–3.30]; P = .16). For the T2DM patients who did not consume ginger, no significant difference in FBS was observed (WMD: −0.27, 95% CI: [−5.09–4.54]; P = .91).",systematic_review

Abstract: Clinical applications of ginger with an expectation of clinical benefits are receiving significant attention. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive discussion in terms of the clinical effects of ginger in all reported areas. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline, randomized controlled trials on the effects of ginger were investigated. Accordingly, 109 eligible papers were fully extracted in terms of study design, population characteristics, evaluation systems, adverse effects, and main outcomes. The reporting quality of the included studies was assessed based on the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized trials and integrated together with studies that investigated the same subjects. The included studies that examined the improvement of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, inflammation, metabolic syndromes, digestive function, and colorectal cancer’s markers were consistently supported, whereas other expected functions were relatively controversial. Nevertheless, only 43 clinical trials (39.4%) met the criterion of having a ‘high quality of evidence.’ In addition to the quality assessment result, small populations and unstandardized evaluation systems were the observed shortcomings in ginger clinical trials. Further studies with adequate designs are warranted to validate the reported clinical functions of ginger.",systematic_review

Abstract: Background and aimsZingiber Officinale, commonly known as ginger, has been widely used traditionally in the daily diet and a variety of medicinal purposes. There are some animal studies on the hypotensive mechanism of ginger. The aim of this systematic review was to extract the evidence from all human participant randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that have assessed the effects of ginger on the blood pressure (BP) of any population.MethodsDatabases including Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ISI Web of Science and also local databases including Sid, magiran, iranmedex were searched up to June, 2016 without language limitation. Relevant bibliographies were also searched. Titles and abstracts were assessed independently by two reviewers and full papers of relevant articles were obtained and assessed. Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials on humans were enrolled in the review. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were done by two reviewers independently and in a case of discrepancy final decision was made by the third reviewer. Meta-analysis was not possible because of heterogeneity of data and incomplete reporting of findings, thus results were synthesized narratively.ResultsInitial searches yielded 60 articles. After analyzing full-text papers, 2 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria. A double blind RCT (n=70) compared the effect of ginger with placebo on cardiovascular risk factors in diabetic patients. There was no significant (p>0.05) effect on systolic nor diastolic pressure (Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) changes was 0.1±1.1).",systematic_review

Abstract: The world's population is ageing at an accelerated pace. Ageing is a natural, physiological but highly complex and multifactorial process that all species in the Tree of Life experience over time. Physical and mental disabilities, and age-related diseases, would increase along with the increasing life expectancy. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is a plant that belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. For hundreds of years, ginger has been consumed in various ways by the natives of Asian countries, both as culinary and medicinal herb for the treatment of many diseases. Mounting evidence suggests that ginger can promote healthy ageing, reduce morbidity, and prolong healthy lifespan. Ginger, a well-known natural product, has been demonstrated to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antimicrobial properties, as well as an outstanding antiviral activity due to a high concentration of antiviral compounds. In this review, the current evidence on the potential role of ginger and its active compounds in the prevention of ageing is discussed.",systematic_review

Abstract: Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world, with breast cancer being the most prevalent cancer. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is one of the most serious side effects of chemotherapy. Because the current CINV treatment option has several flaws, alternative treatment options are required. Ginger has traditionally been used to treat nausea and vomiting, and it also has anticancer properties in breast cancer cells. Based on these findings, researchers investigated whether using ginger to treat CINV in breast cancer patients is both effective and safe. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, and Wanfang from inception to June 2022. Outcomes included Rhodes Index Scores of Nausea, Vomiting, and Retching, severity and frequency of CINV. Five RCTs were included. We pooled all included data and performed subgroup analysis by types of CINV. Overall, authors found that ginger was associated with a reduction in CINV. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis revealed that managing severity of acute CINV in breast cancer patients with ginger was efficient. In terms of managing delayed CINV in breast cancer patients, ginger was also statistically significant. The authors concluded that ginger may be helpful in lowering both acute and delayed CINV in breast cancer patients. Since there were no serious side effects, ginger is thought to be safe.",systematic_review

Abstract: It has been evidenced that very few systematic reviews have examined the effectiveness of ginger for pain duration and its severity among women with primary dysmenorrhea. This meta-analysis was therefore performed to methodically incorporate and significantly evaluate randomized controlled ginger studies for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. The literature was searched using PubMed, Embase, Ovid, ClinicalKey, Medline, and electronic database. We have analyzed clinical trials by comparing ginger with placebo and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in women with primary dysmenorrhea. The primary outcomes assessed in our meta-analysis were pain severity and pain duration. Secondary outcomes were change in bleeding, side effects of the drug, and rate of satisfaction. We have screened a total of 638 studies, out of which narrative synthesis was formulated for eight studies. We have performed a meta-analysis of five trials examining ginger with placebo and other two randomized controlled trials comparing ginger with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID); it seems to be more helpful for relieving menstrual pain than a placebo (mean difference [MD] = 2.67, 95% CI = 3.51-1.84, P = 0.0001, I2 = 86%), although it was found that ginger and NSAIDs were equally effective in pain severity (risk ratios [RR] = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.53-2.52, P = 0.72, I2 =77%). We have not observed any significant difference between ginger and placebo on pain duration among primary dysmenorrheic women (MD = -2.22, 95% CI = -7.62-3.18, P = 0.42, I2 = 56%). Accessible information proposes that oral ginger can be a compelling treatment for primary dysmenorrhea.

Abstract: AbstractThere is an evidence that ginger enhance semen quality via improving different sperm parameters mainly count, viability, motility, morphology and DNA integrity. According to research results in various species, ginger seems to have strong antioxidant properties (due to the presence of active phenolic compounds) and androgenic activity. Ginger improves semen quality and increases fertility of sperm by disrupting the production of free radicals, dissolving oxidative chain reactions, reducing oxidative stress and altering the levels of gonadotropin hormones (LH, FSH) and sex hormones (such as testosterone). The antioxidant and androgenic properties of ginger give a sperm with normal morphological structure (head, middle and tail) and more integrated chromatin. The rate of DNA failure and damage to the mitochondrial genome in these cells is minimal and they have the most progressive motility, the highest viability and the best fertility. Therefore, the use of the ginger significantly improves the biological parameters of sperm (number, total motility, survival rate and normal morphology) and also increases all specialized fertility indicators of sperm. Tacking account of lacking literature and possibility of toxicity and adverse effect of ginger on vital organ, further clinical trial especially on evaluating the safety and clinical effect must be considered. Also, dose and duration of consumption by monitoring of health indicators and biochemical changes in all species such as human, animal and poultry must be applied.",systematic_review

Abstract: Objective This article aims to assess the effects of ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and/or components of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Methods Electronic literature was searched in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Chinese Biomedical Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Database from inception of the database to May 19, 2017, and supplemented by browsing reference lists of potentially eligible articles. Randomized controlled trials on research subjects were included. Data were extracted as a mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analysis of fasting blood glucose (FBG) was performed. Results 10 studies met the inclusion criteria with a total of 490 individuals. Ginger showed a significant beneficial effect in glucose control and insulin sensitivity. The pooled weighted MD of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was −1.00, (95% CI: −1.56, −0.44; P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed that ginger obviously reduced FBG in T2DM patients (−21.24; 95% CI: −33.21, −9.26; P < 0.001).

Abstract: Background and objectivesNausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) occur commonly. Possible harmful side-effects of conventional medicine to the fetus create the need for alternative options to relieve NVP. This systematic review (SR) investigated current evidence regarding orally administered ginger for the treatment of NVP. The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of ginger in treating NVP. The secondary objective was to assess the safety of ginger during pregnancy.MethodsA comprehensive electronic bibliographic database search was carried out. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the efficacy of orally administered ginger, as treatment for NVP in pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy, published in English, were included. Two researchers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. RevMan5 software (Cochrane Collaboration) was used for data analysis. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsTwelve RCTs involving 1278 pregnant women were included. Ginger significantly improved the symptoms of nausea when compared to placebo (MD 1.20, 95% CI 0.56-1.84, p = 0.0002, I2 = 0%). Ginger did not significantly reduce the number of vomiting episodes during NVP, when compared to placebo, although there was a trend towards improvement (MD 0.72, 95% CI -0.03-1.46, p = 0.06, I2 = 71%). Subgroup analyses seemed to favor the lower daily dosage of <1500 mg ginger for nausea relief. Ginger did not pose a significant risk for spontaneous abortion compared to placebo (RR 3.14, 95% CI 0.65-15.11, p = 0.15; I2 = 0%), or to vitamin B6 (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.17-1.42, p = 0.19, I2 = 40%).",systematic_review

Abstract: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) affects over 50% of pediatric patients undergoing chemotherapy, a higher proportion than in adults. CINV often occurs despite adequate antiemetic prophylaxis, hampering patients' willingness to continue the chemotherapy regimen. As an ayurvedic medicine, ginger (Zingiber officinale) has an antiemetic effect by inhibiting serotonin in gastrointestinal nerves and as an NK1 antagonist. Therefore, we aimed to review oral ginger supplementation in children with CINV systematically.Systematic searching was performed in June 2023 from Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, and hand searching. The search consisted of PICO “children chemotherapy”, “ginger”, and “CINV incidence”. We limited the search to only human studies. Studies that meet inclusion and exclusion criteria were included for analysis.Out of 116 studies found with our selection criteria, four were compatible with inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two studies had a small Risk of Bias (RoB), while the others had a high RoB. All studies statistically significantly reduced acute and delayed CINV with the number needed to treat (NNT) 2–4. No adverse effects were reported. However, these studies still had high heterogeneity based on cancer treatment, chemotherapy regimen, ginger dosing, and ginger processing.Ginger has the potential to reduce both the acute and delayed phases of CINV in children. Additional research employing standardized methodologies is recommended to validate this effect.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundDigestive disorders pose significant burdens to millions of people worldwide in terms of morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Turmeric has been traditionally used for conditions associated with the digestive system, and its therapeutic benefits were also confirmed in clinical studies. However, rigorous systematic review on this topic is severely limited. Our study aims to systematically review the therapeutic and adverse effects of turmeric and its compounds on digestive disorders, including dyspepsia, peptic ulcer, irritable bowel disease, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.Methods/DesignThis study will include both randomized controlled trials and non-randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy and safety of turmeric or its compounds in comparison to a placebo or any other active interventions for digestive disorders without any restrictions on participant age or language of publication. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients that have experienced treatment success. Secondary outcomes are the prevalence of an individual symptom of digestive disorders, the proportion of patients who experienced relapse, the number of physician visits/hospitalization due to digestive disorders, health-related quality of life and the proportion of patients who experienced adverse events. Relevant studies will be identified through MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, Dissertations & Theses Database and the Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials from their inception to August 31, 2013. In addition, grey literature such as information published on drug regulatory agencies websites and abstracts/proceedings from conferences will also be reviewed.",systematic_review

Abstract: The effective management of diabetes, a prevalent metabolic condition globally, relies on paying close attention to anthropometric measurements, while recent years have seen a growing interest in researching the potential anti-obesity properties of turmeric/curcumin. In this systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, the impact of turmeric/curcumin supplementation on anthropometric indices in individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was assessed. PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched to identify relevant records published from 1 January 1990 to 1 June 2024. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI), with a p-value ≤ 0.05 indicating statistical significance. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to assess the certainty of evidence. Twenty randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled analysis displayed that supplementation with turmeric/curcumin significantly decreased body weight (WMD: −1.9 kg; 95% CI: −2.9 to −0.9; P ≤ 0.001; GRADE = low), waist circumference (WMD: −1.9 cm; 95% CI: −3.5 to −0.2; P = 0.024; GRADE = low), fat mass% (WMD: −2.9%; 95% CI: −5.6 to −0.1, P = 0.041; GRADE = very low), and hip circumference (WMD: −1.0 cm; 95% CI: −1.2 to −0.8; P ≤ 0.001; GRADE = moderate) but no effects on body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio in people with T2DM.",systematic_review

Abstract: AbstractRadiodermatitis (RD) occurs in 95% of cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. At present, there is no effective treatment for the management of this complication of radiotherapy. Turmeric (Curcuma longa) is a polyphenolic and biologically active natural compound with various pharmacological functions. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the efficacy of curcumin supplementation for reducing RD severity. This review complied with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) statement. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in Cochrane library, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and MEDLINE databases. A total of seven studies comprising 473 cases and 552 controls were included in this review. Four studies demonstrated that curcumin supplementation had a beneficial effect on RD intensity. These data provide evidence for the potential clinical use of curcumin in supportive cancer care. Further large prospective and well‐designed trials are warranted to exactly determine the “real effective extract, supplemental form and dose of curcumin” for RD prevention and treatment of patients receiving radiotherapy.",systematic_review

Abstract: Background: Turmeric (Curcuma longa) and its main bioactive compound curcumin are widely promoted for cardiometabolic health, yet their efficacy on lipid parameters remains uncertain. Piperine, an alkaloid from black pepper, enhances curcumin bioavailability and may potentiate its effects. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of turmeric, alone or combined with piperine, on lipid profiles in adults with metabolic disorders. Methods: A systematic search was conducted (2010–2025) in PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane CENTRAL. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating turmeric supplementation (with or without piperine) on lipid outcomes were included. Methodological quality was assessed with Cochrane RoB 2; certainty of evidence was rated using GRADE. Meta-analyses were performed with random-effects models. The protocol followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Results: Ten records were identified; six full texts were assessed; three RCTs (n ≈ 250) were included in quantitative synthesis, and three additional RCTs narratively. Pooled analysis demonstrated significant reductions in triglycerides (WMD −25.5 mg/dL, 95% CI −32.5 to −18.4), total cholesterol (−14.1 mg/dL, 95% CI −22.9 to −5.3), and LDL-C (−17.0 mg/dL, 95% CI −25.2 to −8.8), with an increase in HDL-C (+5.7 mg/dL, 95% CI +2.0 to +9.4). Subgroup analysis suggested greater LDL-C reduction with turmeric+piperine (−29.6 mg/dL) compared to turmeric alone (−16.2 mg/dL). Certainty of evidence was moderate for TG, TC, LDL-C, and low for HDL-C.",systematic_review

Abstract: Curcumin is the principal polylphenol of turmeric that has been used to treat various disorders. However, its anti-obesity effects in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remain controversial. Therefore, we aimed to perform a meta-analysis on the effects of supplementation with turmeric/curcumin on body weight, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) in these patients. PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and ISI Web of Science were searched until January 2019, without any restrictions. Clinical trials that reported body weight, BMI and WC in patients with NAFLD were included. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) were pooled using a random-effects model. Eight studies (449 participants) fulfilled the eligibility criteria of the present meta-analysis. Overall, meta-analysis could not show any beneficial effect of turmeric/curcumin supplementation on body weight (WMD, −0.54 kg; 95% confidence interval [CI], −2.40, 1.31; p = 0.56; I2 = 0.0%), BMI (WMD, −0.21 kg/m2; 95% CI, −0.71, 0.28; p = 0.39; I2 = 0.0%) and WC (WMD, −0.88 cm; 95% CI, −3.76, 2.00; p = 0.54; I2 = 0.0%). Subgroup analysis based on participants' baseline BMI, type of intervention, and study duration did not show any significant association in all subgroups. The results showed that turmeric/curcumin supplementation had no signiﬁcant effect on body weight, BMI and WC in patients with NAFLD.

Abstract: Background:Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent disorder of the gut interaction characterized by abdominal discomfort and pain associated with altered bowel habits in the absence of structural abnormalities. In spite of IBS' high prevalence and disease burden across the globe, no explanations have been given as to its underlying pathophysiology. As for the treatment of IBS, there is no specific medication, and the most beneficial treatment is usually supportive therapy. Recent animal and human studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of curcumin or turmeric in the treatment of IBS.Methods:We systematically reviewed all available evidence supporting curcumin and turmeric's therapeutic potential in relieving IBS symptoms in the present study. For this purpose, a database search was performed using curcumin, turmeric, and IBS and all their equivalents as of the search terms in Web of Science, Pub-Med, Scopus, Ovid, Embase, and Google Scholar from1990 up to Feb 2021. The investigation was then limited to clinical trials, and then nine articles were collected for data analysis.Results:The findings of the included literature showed that curcumin and turmeric alone or in combination with other medications could improve the severity of IBS as well as the quality of life among people who suffer from IBS symptoms.Conclusion:Overall, medications containing curcumin and turmeric extract due to these compounds' anti-inflammatory effects may improve IBS symptoms, particularly abdominal pain and life quality.",systematic_review

Abstract: PurposeTo determine whether supplementation with turmeric or curcumin extract effects pain and physical function in individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Second, we investigated the therapeutic response (pain and function) of turmeric compared with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).MethodsA search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Review. Inclusion criteria included randomised controlled trials reporting pain and physical function in humans with knee OA comparing turmeric therapy with NSAIDs or no therapy. Two reviewers screened 5273 abstracts. Risk of bias and quality were assessed via Cochrane Collaboration tool and CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) 2010, respectively.ResultsTen studies were included in the final analysis. Eight had high methodological quality and two were categorised as good with a mean CONSORT quality score of 21.1. Nine studies had adequate sequence generation and six had adequate allocation concealment. Participants and outcome assessors were blinded in eight studies. Three of the studies compared turmeric therapy to NSAIDs. All 10 studies showed improvement in pain and function from baseline with turmeric therapy (p≤0.05). In three studies comparing turmeric to NSAIDs, there were no differences in outcome scores (p>0.05). In all studies there were no significant adverse events in the turmeric therapy group.ConclusionCompared with placebo, there appears to be a benefit of turmeric on knee OA pain and function. Based on a small number of studies the effects are similar to that of NSAIDs. Variables such as optimal dosing, frequency and formulation remain unclear at this time.",systematic_review

The clinical outcomes considered were the severity of oral mucositis, pain level, and weight loss.ResultsA total of eight articles that met our inclusion criteria were included in our meta-analysis. At the 3-week follow-up visit, the turmeric group showed significantly lower grades of oral mucositis compared to the control group (p = 0.03). When compared to the placebo group, a significant difference in the degree of oral mucositis was observed at the 4-(p = 0.03) and 6-week (p < 0.00001) follow-up visits. No significant difference in pain levels was observed between the turmeric and control groups at any of the follow-up visits. However, a significant improvement in pain levels for the turmeric group when compared with the placebo group was observed only at the 6-week follow-up visit (p = 0.006). Interestingly, a significant improvement in pain levels was observed for the turmeric group at the 2-, 4-, 5-, and 6-week follow-up visits (p < 0.05) when compared to the non-placebo group.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of curcumin/turmeric supplementation on liver enzymes in patients with NAFLD.MethodsPubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar were systematically searched until December 2017. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which examined effect of curcumin/turmeric supplementation on NAFLD in adult participants. Main outcome was alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Potential risks of bias (ROB) were assessed by using Cochrane ROB tool.ResultsAll included studies showed low ROB in most of item of Cochrane ROB tool. Meta-analysis of 4 randomized controlled trials including 228 subjects showed a trend toward significant reduction of ALT blood concentrations in subgroup with ≥1000 mg/day curcumin supplementation (–11.36 IU/L, 95% CI: –22.75 to 0.02; I2:51%). Meta-analysis showed a significant reduction of AST in studies with 8-weeks administration (–9.22 IU/L, 95% CI: –12.77 to –5.67; I2: 49%).ConclusionThis review suggests that curcumin/turmeric might have a favorable effect on NAFLD in higher dosage.

Abstract: BackgroundTurmeric has traditionally been used to treat various inflammatory conditions, including knee osteoarthritis (OA). There are multiple turmeric preparations available. However, the comparative effectiveness of these products remains unknown. This study aimed to assess the comparative effectiveness of turmeric products for knee OA outcomes by conducting a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs).MethodsPubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched up to August 2024, identifying RCTs that compared turmeric preparations and/or active comparators versus placebo. The primary outcome measured pain reduction, using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), while secondary outcomes evaluated pain using other tools. Mean differences (MDs) were pooled using a random-effects model, and the concept of minimum clinically important difference (MCID) was considered.ResultsSeventeen studies were included. All turmeric preparations significantly reduced WOMAC pain. The mean differences (MD, 95% CI) for WOMAC pain reduction were as follows: − 4.01 (–6.22, − 1.80) for conventional curcuminoid preparations (CT) plus active drug comparators (AC, defined as NSAIDs and acetaminophen), − 3.33 (–5.26, − 1.39) for AC, − 3.17 (–5.50, − 0.83) for CT, and − 2.47 (–3.27, − 1.67) for bioavailability-enhanced curcuminoid preparations (BE). The BE preparation also demonstrated a 30% reduction in WOMAC pain compared to placebo, reaching the MCID threshold.",systematic_review

Abstract: AIM:The review elaborates on the efficacy of turmeric/curcumin formulations on chemo/radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer.METHODS:This systematic review was conducted; trials were included comparing turmeric/curcumin formulations with chlorhexidine/povidone-iodine/normal saline or any conventional practices in head and neck cancer patients. Studies published through May 2023 were identified using Medline, Web of Science, CINAHL, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. A systematic review was conducted, including a meta-analysis, following PRISMA guidelines. The methodology’s quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.RESULTS:Thirteen of the 14 studies found that turmeric formulation contributed to reducing the occurrence (p < .0001) and intensity of oral mucositis (p = .001) and significantly lesser incidence of secondary outcomes such as pain (p = .001), erythema (p = .05), dysphagia (p < .05), ulcer size (p = .000), burning sensation (p < .001), dermatitis (p < .05), and weight loss (p < .001) in the turmeric group. There was also a lesser incidence of treatment breaks (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy) due to the severity of mucositis and other complications. The risk of bias was judged as low for six studies (a score of five or higher), medium in three studies (four out of seven), and high risk for the other five.CONCLUSION:The reviewers identified that turmeric formulations reduced the severity of oral mucositis. Future research is needed to determine the optimal dose and schedule of application of turmeric formulations in preventing oral mucositis.",systematic_review

Abstract: Background:Oral Mucositis(OM) is an acute debilitating dose limiting toxicity of Radiotherapy/Radiochemotherapy(RT/RCT) in management of Head and Neck Cancer (HNC). Curcumin/Turmeric may reduce OM in patients. Aim: Efficacy of Curcumin/Turmeric for preventing and ameliorating the onset and severity of RT/RCT induced OM was analysed in this review. Methods:A systematic literature search with meta-analysis were performed using Mesh terms in PubMed, Google scholar, Science Direct, Cochrane library and manual searching, articles published from 2010 to April 2021 were included. Clinical trials that studied the efficacy/effects of turmeric / curcumin in management of RT/RCT induced OM in HNC patients were included. Statistical Analysis were done to calculate the pooled Risk ratio at 95%confidence interval with significance at p <0.05. Results:Nine studies with overall 582 patients with HNC undergoing RT/RCT were included qualitatively. From evidence, orally 1,500-2,000 mg/day of Curcumin/Turmeric, (80mg/day/0.1%mouthwash) of nanocurcumin, topically gel/mouthwash used with increase in frequency prior and the entire course of RT/RCT with long follow ups are beneficial with no serious adverse effects. Meta-analysis of 5 prophylactic trials favoured curcumin/turmeric in reducing the severity of OM (RR 0.48 at 95% CI=0.23,0.99,P=0.05), did not prevent the overall incidence of OM (RR 0.99 at 95%CI=0.95,1.03,P=0.67) but delayed the onset of OM (RR 0.38 at 95% CI=0.18,0.80, P=0.01) during RT/RCT compared to control.",systematic_review

Abstract: AbstractAlthough turmeric and its curcumin-enriched extracts have been used for treating arthritis, no systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been conducted to evaluate the strength of the research. We systemically evaluated all RCTs of turmeric extracts and curcumin for treating arthritis symptoms to elucidate the efficacy of curcuma for alleviating the symptoms of arthritis. Literature searches were conducted using 12 electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Korean databases, Chinese medical databases, and Indian scientific database. Search terms used were “turmeric,” “curcuma,” “curcumin,” “arthritis,” and “osteoarthritis.” A pain visual analogue score (PVAS) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) were used for the major outcomes of arthritis. Initial searches yielded 29 articles, of which 8 met specific selection criteria. Three among the included RCTs reported reduction of PVAS (mean difference: −2.04 [−2.85, −1.24]) with turmeric/curcumin in comparison with placebo (P < .00001), whereas meta-analysis of four studies showed a decrease of WOMAC with turmeric/curcumin treatment (mean difference: −15.36 [−26.9, −3.77]; P = .009). Furthermore, there was no significant mean difference in PVAS between turmeric/curcumin and pain medicine in meta-analysis of five studies. Eight RCTs included in the review exhibited low to moderate risk of bias. There was no publication bias in the meta-analysis. In conclusion, these RCTs provide scientific evidence that supports the efficacy of turmeric extract (about 1000 mg/day of curcumin) in the treatment of arthritis.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundProbiotics are microorganisms, mainly bacteria, which benefit the host’s health. Many studies support the role of probiotics as a contributor to gastrointestinal health, and nowadays many authors are trying to prove its influence in oral health maintenance. ObjectivesTo review the published literature with the purpose of knowing the importance of using probiotics as a preventive and therapeutic method for oral infectious diseases management.Material and MethodsAn electronic search in PubMed database with the keywords “oral health AND probiotics AND dentistry” was conducted. The inclusion criteria were: randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that assess the action of any probiotic strain in the treatment and / or prevention of an infectious oral disease, RCTs that assess the action of any probiotic strain on counting colony forming units (CFU) of oral pathogens, systematic reviews and meta-analysis. The Jadad scale was used to assess the high quality of RCTs.ResultsFifteen articles were considered for this review. Of which, 12 were RCTs of good / high quality (Jadad scale), two meta-analysis and one systematic review.ConclusionsThe literature reviewed suggests probiotics usage could be beneficial for the maintenance of oral health, due to its ability to decrease the colony forming units (CFU) counts of the oral pathogens. However, randomized clinical trials with long-term follow-up periods are needed to confirm their efficacy in reducing the prevalence/incidence of oral infectious diseases. Furthermore, the recognition of specific strains with probiotic activity for each infectious oral disease is required, in order to determine exact dose, treatment time and ideal vehicles.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundOral rehydration salts (ORS), zinc, and continued feeding are the recommended treatments for community-acquired acute diarrhea among young children. However, probiotics are becoming increasingly popular treatments for diarrhea in some countries. We sought to estimate the effect of probiotics on diarrhea morbidity and mortality in children < 5 years of age.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials to estimate the effect of probiotic microorganisms for the treatment of community-acquired acute diarrhea in children. Data were abstracted into a standardized table and study quality was assessed using the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group (CHERG) adaption of the GRADE technique. We measured the relative effect of probiotic treatment in addition to recommended rehydration on hospitalizations, duration and severity. We then calculated the average percent difference for all continuous outcomes and performed a meta-analysis for discrete outcomes.ResultsWe identified 8 studies for inclusion in the final database. No studies reported diarrhea mortality and overall the evidence was low to moderate quality. Probiotics reduced diarrhea duration by 14.0% (95% CI: 3.8-24.2%) and stool frequency on the second day of treatment by 13.1% (95% CI: 0.8 – 25.3%). There was no effect on the risk of diarrhea hospitalizations.ConclusionProbiotics may be efficacious in reducing diarrhea duration and stool frequency during a diarrhea episode.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundInfantile colic is a common paediatric condition which causes significant parental distress. Increased intestinal coliform colonization in addition to alteration in Lactobacillus abundance and distribution may play an important role in its pathogenesis.The objectives of this systematic review are to evaluate the efficacy of probiotic supplementation in the reduction of crying time and successful treatment of infantile colic.MethodsLiterature searches were conducted of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Only randomized controlled trials enrolling term, healthy infants with colic were included. A meta-analysis of included trials was performed utilizing the Cochrane Collaboration methodology.ResultsThree trials that enrolled 220 breastfed infants met inclusion criteria, of which 209 infants were available for analysis. Two of the studies were assessed as good quality. Lactobacillus reuteri (strains-American Type Culture Collection Strain 55730 and DSM 17 938) was the only species utilized in the therapeutic intervention. Two of the trials were industry funded. Probiotic supplementation compared to simethicone or placebo significantly and progressively shortened crying times to 7 days reaching a plateau at three weeks post initiation of therapy [mean difference −56.03 minutes; 95% CI (−59.92, -52.15)]. Similarly, probiotics compared to placebo significantly increased the treatment success of infantile colic with a relative risk (RR) of 0.06; 95% CI (0.01, 0.25) and a number needed to treat of 2.ConclusionsAlthough L. reuteri may be effective as a treatment strategy for crying in exclusively breastfed infants with colic, the evidence supporting probiotic use for the treatment of infant colic or crying in formula-fed infants remains unresolved.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundAntibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) are associated with high morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Probiotics may mitigate the existing disease burden. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of co-administration of probiotics with antibiotics in preventing these adverse outcomes in adult inpatients.MethodsSystematic searches of MEDLINE (1946 to May 2012), Embase (1980 to May 2012), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were undertaken on May 31, 2012, to identify relevant publications. We searched for randomized controlled trials, published in English, of adult inpatients who were receiving antibiotics and who were randomly assigned to co-administration of probiotics or usual care, with or without the use of placebo. Studies were included if they reported on AAD or CDI (or both) as outcomes. Data for predetermined criteria evaluating study characteristics, methods, and risk of bias were extracted. Trials were given a global rating of good, fair, or poor by at least 2 reviewers. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model, and pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.ResultsSixteen trials met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Four studies were of good quality, 5 were of fair quality, and 7 were of poor quality. Pooled analyses revealed significant reductions in the risks of AAD (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.79) and CDI (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.61) among patients randomly assigned to co-administration of probiotics.",systematic_review

Abstract: Probiotics have been linked to a reduction in the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and late-onset sepsis in preterm infants. Recently, probiotics have also proved to reduce time to achieve full enteral feeding (FEF). However, the relationship between FEF achievement and type of feeding in infants treated with probiotics has not been explored yet. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of probiotics in reducing time to achieve FEF in preterm infants, according to type of feeding (exclusive human milk (HM) vs. formula). Randomized-controlled trials involving preterm infants receiving probiotics, and reporting on time to reach FEF were included in the systematic review. Trials reporting on outcome according to type of feeding (exclusive HM vs. formula) were included in the meta-analysis. Fixed-effect or random-effects models were used as appropriate. Results were expressed as mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Twenty-five studies were included in the systematic review. In the five studies recruiting exclusively HM-fed preterm infants, those treated with probiotics reached FEF approximately 3 days before controls (MD −3.15 days (95% CI −5.25/−1.05), p = 0.003). None of the two studies reporting on exclusively formula-fed infants showed any difference between infants receiving probiotics and controls in terms of FEF achievement. The limited number of included studies did not allow testing for other subgroup differences between HM and formula-fed infants. However, if confirmed in further studies, the 3-days reduction in time to achieve FEF in exclusively HM-fed preterm infants might have significant implications for their clinical management.",systematic_review

Abstract: Over the years, probiotics have been used in the treatment of a variety of diseases. The use of probiotics in the treatment of periodontal disease has caught on over the last decade or so. This review was performed to determine whether administration of probiotics produced a lasting clinical benefit in the treatment of periodontal disease. A MEDLINE, Cochrane database and a hand search was performed on human randomized placebo controlled trials using probiotics in the treatment of periodontal disease. A total of thirteen papers which addressed the question of the use of probiotics in the treatment of periodontal disease were retrieved. Most of the studies reviewed showed only a short term benefit with regards to reduction in gingival inflammation and probing depth reduction. Lasting clinical benefits were not seen in any of the studies. At least four different combinations and strains of probiotics have been used in the studies. There also existed significant heterogeneity in the methodology of the studies reviewed. It was concluded that current regimens of probiotics in the treatment of periodontal disease produce only short-term clinical and microbiologic benefits.",systematic_review

Abstract: IntroductionBacterial vaginosis (BV) is a highly prevalent vaginal polymicrobial disorder commonly encountered in women of childbearing age. Therapy with only recommended antibiotics results in low cure rates and unacceptably high recurrence rates. The use of probiotics as a complementary approach for use with antibiotics for the treatment of BV remains unclear. This review aims to assess the efficacy of lactobacilli administered intravaginally in conjunction with antibiotics for the treatment of BV.Methods and analysisThe Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, Medline/PubMed and Embase will be used to search for articles from database inception to November 2016. Randomised controlled clinical trials using lactobacilli administered intravaginally in conjunction with antibiotics to treat BV will be included. Primary outcome will be the BV cure rate. The recurrence rate will be examined as secondary outcome. Two reviewers will independently select trials and extract data from the original publications. The risk of bias will be assessed according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We will perform data synthesis using the Review Manager (RevMan) software V.5.2.3. To assess heterogeneity, we will compute the I2 statistic.Ethics and disseminationThis study will be a review of published data and it is not necessary to obtain ethical approval.

Abstract: IntroductionInfantile colic is a common pediatric problem. The cause of infantile colic remains unclear. Treatment options are limited. Evidence suggests that probiotics might offer some benefit. The aim of the study was to systematically assess the effectiveness of probiotics supplementation in the management of infantile colic.Material and methodsMEDLINE and the Cochrane Library were searched up to April 2016 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of probiotics (any well-defined strain) compared with placebo for the management of infantile colic. The outcome measures of interest were treatment success and the duration of crying at the end of the intervention.ResultsSeven RCTs (471 participants) were included. Compared with placebo the administration of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 at a daily dose of 108 CFU was associated with the treatment success (relative risk = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.10–2.81, number needed to treat 5, 95% CI: 4–8) and reduced crying times at the end of the intervention (mean difference: –49 min, 95% CI: –66 to –33); however, the effect was mainly seen in exclusively breastfed infants. Other probiotics (single or in combinations) were studied in single trials only.ConclusionsSome probiotics, primarily L. reuteri DSM 17938, may be considered for the management of infantile colic.

Abstract: Context: Constipation in children is a prevalent, burdensome, and psychologically important pediatric issue, the treatment of which remains a global challenge. The use of probiotics has been reported for management of the gastrointestinal microbiota.Objective: This study reviewed the existing literatures of 6 Randomized Control Trials (RCTs) to ascertain some baseline understanding and available information for the effects of probiotics on stool frequency and consistency in children with constipation.Data Sources: PubMed, Springer, Elsevier Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Ovid (Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO), Orbis, and Web of Science from the earliest record in each database to 15 September, 2016.Study selection: Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials that compared the effect of probiotics interventions to any control intervention on stool frequency and consistency.Data Extraction: Studies were identified by searching electronic databases. The meta-analysis was performed by Review Manager 5.3 software using a randomized model.Results: Six studies were identified. The use of probiotics significantly increased the stool frequency [mean difference (MD), 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.14–1.31; P = 0.02]. Subgroup assessment showed a significantly increased stool frequency in Asian patients (MD, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.33–2.02; P = 0.006), but no significant difference in stool consistency (MD, −0.07; 95% CI, −0.21–0.06; P = 0.27).Limitations: Only six RCTs met the criteria and were included.",systematic_review

Abstract: Background: Neonatal jaundice is a relatively prevalent disease and affects approximately 2.4–15% newborns. Probiotics supplementation therapy could assist to improve the recovery of neonatal jaundice, through enhancing immunity mainly by regulating bacterial colonies. However, there is limited evidence regarding the effect of probiotics on bilirubin level in neonates. Therefore, this study aims at systematically evaluating the efficacy and safety of probiotics supplement therapy for pathological neonatal jaundice.Methods: Databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Fang Database (Wan Fang), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (VIP) were searched and the deadline is December 2016. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics supplementation for pathological neonatal jaundice in publications were extracted by two reviewers. The cochrane tool was applied to assessing the risk of bias of the trials. The extracted information of RCTs should include efficacy rate, serum total bilirubin level, time of jaundice fading, duration of phototherapy, duration of hospitalization, adverse reactions. The main outcomes of the trials were analyzed by Review Manager 5.3 software.

Abstract: Background and aimsAngiogenesis is the process of new blood vessel sprouting from the existing vasculature. It is physiologically present during wound healing, development of placenta, tissue growth and adipogenesis as well as playing role in pathological processes such as tumor growth, metastasis, obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Angiogenesis therapy is as a Strategy for treatment of some diseases. The angiogenic process is regulated by numerous factors e.g. dietary factors. In this paper, we reviewed available documents and research relevant to vitamin D and angiogenesis.MethodsA systematic review of recent literature was conducted using the PRISMA guidelines. The sources of the data were PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane, Web of Science and Scopus. Key search terms were “Angiogenesis”, “Angiogenesis factor”, “vitamin D”, “1,25 (OH)2 D3” and “Calciteriol”. Articles included in the review were original research articles in peer-reviewed journals which thoroughly examined and compared on the basis of study design, outcomes, and results.ResultsThe effect of vitamin D on angiogenesis was first reported in 1990. Evidence from current studies supports anti-angiogenesis and pro-angiogenesis effects of the 1, 25 (OH) 2 D3 in several in vivo and in vitro studies. Results from recent studies implies that different effects of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D3 on angiogenesis depends on the cellular types, cellular condition and type of chemokines released from the tissue.",systematic_review

Abstract: Objectives:To explore the effect of vitamin D supplementation in prevention of respiratory tract infections on the basis of published clinical trials.Materials and Methods:Clinical trials were searched from various electronic databases. Five clinical trials were suitable for inclusion. Outcome was events of respiratory tract infections in vitamin D group and placebo group. Data was reported as odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. Both random and fixed model was used for analysis. Analysis was done with the help of Comprehensive meta-analysis software 2.Results:Events of respiratory tract infections were significantly lower in vitamin D group as compared to control group [Odds ratio = 0.582 (0.417 – 0.812) P = 0.001] according to random model. Results were similar in fixed model. On separate analysis of clinical trials dealing with groups of children and adults, beneficial effect of vitamin D was observed in both, according to fixed model [Odds ratio = 0.579 (0.416 – 0.805), P = 0.001 and Odd ratio = 0.653 (0.472 – 0.9040, P = 0.010 respectively]. On using random model beneficial effect persisted in children's group but became nonsignificant in adults group [Odds ratio = 0.579 (0.416 – 0.805), P = 0.001 and Odd ratio = 0.544 (0.278 – 1.063) P = 0.075 respectively].Conclusion:Vitamin D supplementation decreases the events related to respiratory tract infections.

Abstract: Melatonin is an indolamine produced by the pineal gland and it can exert a potent antioxidant effect. Its free radical scavenger properties have been used to advantage in different organ transplants in animal experiments. Several concentrations and administration pathways have been tested and melatonin has shown encouraging beneficial results in many transplants of organs such as the liver, lungs, heart, pancreas, and kidneys. The objective of the present study was to review the scientific literature regarding the use of melatonin in ovary transplantation. A systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was carried out using the Cochrane and Pubmed databases and employing the terms ‘melatonin’ AND ‘ovary’ AND ‘transplantation.’ After analysis, 5 articles were extracted addressing melatonin use in ovary transplants and involving 503 animals. Melatonin enhanced various graft aspects like morphology, apoptosis, immunological reaction, revascularization, oxidative stress, and survival rate. Melatonin’s antioxidative and antiapoptotic properties seemingly produce positive effects on ovarian graft activity. Despite the promising results, further studies in humans need to be conducted to consolidate its use, as ovary transplantation for fertility preservation is gradually being moved from the experimental stage to a clinical setting.",systematic_review

Abstract: AbstractBackgroundMelatonin administration to high cholesterol-treated and high fat-treated rats has been shown to suppress body weight and visceral adiposity. In addition, in various animal models related to obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes, melatonin has beneficial efficacy in ameliorating various metabolic symptoms, including attenuating weight gain, lowering blood pressure (BP), and improving insulin resistance. This systematic review aims to investigate whether melatonin or melatonin agonists significantly attenuate metabolic side effects among psychiatric populations treated with atypical antipsychotics.MethodsFour randomized controlled trials were identified through a comprehensive literature search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library on 22 October 2015. These four trials (including three melatonin studies and one ramelteon study) included 138 patients, of whom 71 were treated with melatonin or ramelteon and 67 were treated with a placebo. Because of high heterogeneity, we did not carry out a meta analysis.ResultsMelatonin was beneficial in lowering blood pressure among bipolar disorder patients; this blood pressure-lowering effect was not prominent among schizophrenic patients. Melatonin appeared to improve lipid profiles and body composition and attenuated weight gain among both schizophrenic and bipolar disorder patients. Ramelteon showed a significant efficacy in lowering total cholesterol level.DiscussionDespite the few studies included, this systematic review provided promising evidence of the potential benefits of melatonin and its agonists in attenuating one or more components of metabolic syndrome among psychiatric patients using atypical antipsychotics.",systematic_review

Abstract: Studies have investigated the relationship between genetic variants and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, the results remain inconclusive. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of rs10830963 and rs1387153 variants in melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B) and rs1801278 variant in insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) with GDM susceptibility. Electronic database of PubMed, Medline, Embase, and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) were searched for relevant studies between 2005 and 2014. The odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) were employed to estimate the association. Total ten case-control studies, including 3428 GDM cases and 4637 healthy controls, met the inclusion criteria. Our results showed a significant association between the three genetic variants and GDM risk, rs10830963 with a P-value less than 0.0001, rs1387153 with a P-value of 0.0002, and rs1801278 with a P-value of 0.001. Furthermore, all the genetic models in these three polymorphisms were associated with increased risks of GDM as well (P< = 0.009). In conclusion, our study found that the genetic polymorphisms rs10830963 and rs1387153 in MTNR1B and rs1801278 in IRS1 were associated with an increased risk of developing GDM.

Abstract: ABSTRACTBackground and AimsPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent gynecological condition affecting women of reproductive age, with implications for multiple aspects of women's health. Recent research indicates that melatonin (MLT) may enhance several dimensions of this syndrome via various mechanisms. Consequently, this study was undertaken to systematically evaluate the impact of MLT supplementation on different aspects of PCOS.MethodsAccording to the PRISMA guideline, we identified studies published between January 2013 and November 4, 2024, through a comprehensive electronic search of several reputable databases, including Web of Science (WoS), PubMed (MEDLINE), ProQuest, Scopus, and Google Scholar, utilizing MESH keywords. A meta‐analysis was conducted employing a random‐effects model, during which we computed the standardized mean differences (SMDs) along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals.ResultsA total of 12 studies were incorporated into the meta‐analysis, encompassing 1590 women diagnosed with PCOS. Among these participants, 710 were assigned to the intervention group, while 692 were placed in the comparison or control group, representing data collected from six countries.

Abstract: Background: Burnout among healthcare professionals is increasingly recognized as a syndrome with biological correlations. Beyond psychosocial factors, circadian misalignment, sleep disturbances, and hormonal dysregulation—particularly involving melatonin and cortisol—are emerging as relevant mechanisms. Methods: We systematically reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2025 examining associations between burnout, melatonin, circadian disruption, sleep quality, and related biomarkers in healthcare workers. Results: Across 14 included studies, burnout was associated with suppressed melatonin secretion, cortisol dysregulation, and circadian misalignment, including social jet lag and poor sleep quality. Night-shift nurses consistently displayed greater circadian disruption and higher burnout scores than day-shift colleagues. Evidence also suggests that environmental and interventional approaches—such as optimizing daylight exposure and melatonin supplementation to improve sleep quality and cognitive performance—may mitigate circadian disruption and occupational fatigue. Conclusions: Burnout should be recognized as a biopsychosocial syndrome with measurable chronobiological correlates. Future research should integrate circadian biomarkers into occupational health assessments and evaluate preventive strategies aimed at preserving circadian health in healthcare professionals.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundDelirium is a syndrome characterized by acute fluctuations and alterations in attention and arousal. Critically ill patients are at particularly high risk, and those that develop delirium are more likely to experience poor clinical outcomes such as prolonged duration of ICU and hospital length of stay, and increased mortality. Melatonin and melatonin agonists (MMA) have the potential to decrease the incidence and severity of delirium through their hypnotic and sedative-sparing effects, thus improving health-related outcomes. The objective of this review is to synthesize the available evidence pertaining to the efficacy and safety of MMA for the prevention and treatment of ICU delirium.MethodsWe will search Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and CINAHL to identify studies evaluating MMA in critically ill populations.

Abstract: AbstractIntroductionMelatonin is commonly used for sleep and jetlag at low doses. There is less documentation on the safety of higher doses which are being increasingly used for a wide variety of conditions. This systematic review aimed to investigate the safety of higher doses of melatonin in adults.MethodsWe searched Medline, Scopus, Embase and PsycINFO databases from study inception until December 2019 with convenience searches until October 2020. The inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials investigating high-dose melatonin (≥10mg) in human adults over 30 years of age. The outcomes examined were the number of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and withdrawals due to AEs. A meta-analysis was conducted on studies lasting 3 months or longer. Results79 studies were identified with a total of 3861 participants. 29 studies (37%) made no mention of the presence or absence of AEs. Only 4 studies met the pre-specified low-risk of bias criteria for meta-analysis. In that small subset, melatonin did not cause a detectable increase in SAEs (Rate Ratio=0.88 [0.52, 1.50], p=0.64) or withdrawals due to AEs (0.93 [0.24, 3.56], p=0.92), but did appear to increase the risk of AEs such as drowsiness, headache, and dizziness (1.40, [1.15, 1.69], p<0.001). DiscussionThere has been limited AE reporting from high-dose melatonin studies. Based on this limited evidence, melatonin appears to have a good safety profile. Better safety reporting in future long-term trials is needed to confirm this as our confidence limits were very wide due to the paucity of suitable data.",systematic_review

Abstract: Melatonin is an important hormone for regulating mammalian circadian biology and cellular homeostasis. Recent evidence has shown that melatonin exerts anti-nociception effects in both animals and humans. However, according to clinical trials, the anti-nociception effects of melatonin are still controversial. The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the anti-nociception effects of melatonin premedication. The primary outcome was the effects of melatonin on pain intensity. The secondary outcomes included the number of patients with analgesic requirements, total analgesic consumption, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. In total, 19 studies were included in the current meta-analysis. The pooling data show that melatonin significantly decreased the pain intensity, as evidenced by the pain scores. Moreover, melatonin administration also reduced the proportion of patients with analgesic requirements and BDNF levels. However, the effects of melatonin on total analgesic consumption still require further confirmation. Collectively, the current meta-analysis supports the use of melatonin for anti-nociception.",systematic_review

Abstract: The treatments of choice in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA-receptor antagonists, although doubts remain about the therapeutic effectiveness of these drugs. Herbal medicine products have been used in the treatment of Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) but with various responses. The objective of this article was to review evidences from controlled studies in order to determine whether herbs can be useful in the treatment of cognitive disorders in the elderly. Randomized controlled studies assessing AD in individuals older than 65 years were identified through searches of MEDLINE, LILACS, Cochrane Library, dissertation Abstract (USA), ADEAR (Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials Database), National Research Register, Current Controlled trials, Centerwatch Trials Database and PsychINFO Journal Articles. The search combined the terms Alzheimer disease, dementia, cognition disorders, Herbal, Phytotherapy. The crossover results were evaluated by the Jadad's measurement scale. The systematic review identified two herbs and herbal formulations with therapeutic effects for the treatment of AD: Melissa officinalis, Salvia officinalis and Yi-Gan San and BDW (Ba Wei Di Huang Wan). Ginkgo biloba was identified in a meta-analysis study. All five herbs are useful for cognitive impairment of AD. M. officinalis and Yi-Gan San are also useful in agitation, for they have sedative effects. These herbs and formulations have demonstrated good therapeutic effectiveness but these results need to be compared with those of traditional drugs.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundThere has been a global increase in the use of herbal medicinal products (HMPs). About a quarter of UK adults use HMPs, bought over the counter by self-prescription and often not disclosed to healthcare professionals. Potential herb-drug interaction is a clinical concern, with older people at greater risk because of co-morbidities and slower clearance of pharmacologically active compounds. While there is a good understanding of general herbal medicine use by older people, less is known about the extent and implications of concurrent use with prescription medicines. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the prevalence, patterns, safety issues and other factors associated with concurrent prescription and herbal medicines use among older adults.Methods/designSystematic electronic searches of MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Web of Science and Cochrane from inception till present for studies reporting the concurrent use of prescription medicines with HMPs in older adults (≥65 years). Lateral searching via related citation (PubMed) and checking reference lists of identified studies will be performed. Two reviewers will independently screen studies, extract data and appraise methodological quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for prevalence data and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist. Qualitative and quantitative studies from all settings will be included. Non-empirical papers, in vitro experiments and animal studies will be excluded.",systematic_review

Abstract: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication following cardiac surgery, often leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Despite its prevalence, the role of acetaminophen in preventing AKI after cardiac surgery remains uncertain. This meta-analysis sought to clarify whether perioperative administration of acetaminophen could reduce the risk of postoperative AKI in adult patients undergoing cardiac procedures. To address this question, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by searching the MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Embase databases. Studies comparing the effects of perioperative acetaminophen to those of no acetaminophen in adult cardiac surgery patients were evaluated, with risk of bias assessed for each study. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted to strengthen the reliability of the findings. In total, 13 studies, including nine randomized controlled trials and four observational studies, involving 11,583 patients, were analyzed. The results showed that acetaminophen administration was associated with a lower incidence of AKI [OR 0.62 (95% CI 0.40–0.97), P = 0.04]. Additionally, acetaminophen use was linked to reduced in-hospital mortality, delirium rates, and shorter ICU stays, though it had no significant effect on overall hospital length of stay. These findings suggest that perioperative acetaminophen administration may play a protective role in reducing both AKI incidence and in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Until large multicenter randomized controlled trials confirm these results, acetaminophen may still be considered as a preventive measure for patients both before cardiopulmonary bypass initiation and in the postoperative period.",systematic_review

Abstract: Introduction: There are few reports summarizing the effectiveness of oral and intravenous (IV) acetylcysteine. We determined the proportion of acetaminophen poisoned patients who develop hepatotoxicity (serum transaminase > 1000 IU/L) when treated with oral and IV acetylcysteine.Methods: Studies were double abstracted by trained researchers. We determined the proportions of patients who developed hepatotoxicity for each route using a random effects model. Studies were further stratified by early and late treatment.Results: We screened 4,416 abstracts; 16 articles, including 5,164 patients, were included in the meta-analysis. The overall rate of hepatotoxicity for the oral and IV routes were 12.6% and 13.2%, respectively. Treatment delays are associated with a higher rate of hepatotoxicity.Conclusion: Studies report similar rates of hepatotoxicity for oral and IV acetylcysteine, but direct comparisons are lacking. While it is difficult to disentangle the effects of dose and duration from route, our findings suggest that the rates of hepatotoxicity are similar for oral and IV administration.",systematic_review

Abstract: IntroductionThere are discordant reports on N-acetylcysteine (NAC) efficacy in non-acetaminophen acute liver failure (ALF).AimTo determine whether NAC is beneficial in non-acetaminophen ALF.Material and methodsWe performed a systemic review and meta-analysis of published data to address the question. PubMed and MEDLINE were searched using the terms non-acetylcysteine and ALF due to non-acetaminophen, viral infection, drug-induced or autoimmune hepatitis. The primary outcome was overall mortality. Secondary outcomes were transplant-free survival and length of hospital stay. Risk ratios were calculated using a random model for meta-analysis.ResultsA total of 672 patients were included in this meta-analysis from 5 prospective studies (NAC group: n = 334; control group: n = 338). Viral hepatitis (45.8% vs. 32.8%) followed by drug-induced liver injury (24.6% vs. 27.5%), indeterminate cause (13.2% vs. 21.6%) and autoimmune hepatitis (6.6% vs. 8.9%) were the most common etiologies of ALF in the treatment group and control group respectively. Treatment with N-acetylcysteine improved the transplant-free survival significantly (55.1% vs. 28.1%; RR = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.33–0.94) whereas the overall survival was not improved with NAC (71% vs. 59.8%; RR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.48–1.09). The NAC treatment was associated with shorter hospital stay (standard difference in means (SMD) = –1.62; 95% CI: –1.84 to –1.40, p < 0.001).ConclusionsThe treatment of patients with acute liver failure with N-acetylcysteine improved transplant-free survival and length of stay.",systematic_review

The effects of intravenous and oral acetaminophen for managing pain and supporting rehabilitation following TJA were analysed using randomized controlled trials. PRISMA guidelines were followed. The effectiveness of the administration routes was compared based on visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at 24 and 48 h, total morphine usage within 24 h, and total duration of hospital stay.RESULTSThe meta-analysis included seven studies comparing intravenous acetaminophen groups and oral acetaminophen groups. The results demonstrated that oral acetaminophen was comparable to intravenous acetaminophen with regard to VAS scores at 24 h and 48 h (P = 0.76 and 0.08, respectively). The difference in total morphine use between the two groups was not significant (P = 0.22).",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundIbuprofen and acetaminophen are widely used as adjuvant analgesics for postoperative pain. This meta-analysis compared the effects of intravenous (IV) ibuprofen and acetaminophen on postoperative opioid consumption and pain intensity after general anesthesia.MethodsPubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify relevant studies published up to May 2023. Randomized controlled trials comparing the effects of perioperative IV ibuprofen and acetaminophen on postoperative opioid consumption and pain after general anesthesia were included in the meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA).ResultsEight studies with 494 participants were included. Compared to IV acetaminophen, IV ibuprofen significantly reduced 24 h opioid consumption, presented as morphine equivalents (mean difference [MD]: –6.01 mg, 95% CI [–8.60, –3.42], P < 0.00001, I2 = 55%), and pain scores (on a scale of 0–10) at 4–6 h (MD: –0.83, 95% CI [–1.29, –0.37], P = 0.0004, I2 = 65%) and 12 h (MD: –0.38, 95% CI [–0.68, –0.08], P = 0.01, I2 = 11%) postoperatively. These results were statistically significant in TSA. Pain scores at 24 h postoperatively and side effects were not significantly different between the two groups in the meta-analysis, and TSA revealed that the sample size was too small to adequately evaluate the effects, requiring further studies for conclusive results.ConclusionsPerioperative IV ibuprofen reduced 24 h opioid consumption and pain severity up to 12 h postoperatively compared to acetaminophen.",systematic_review

Abstract: Although widely believed by pediatricians and parents to be safe for use in infants and children when used as directed, increasing evidence indicates that early life exposure to paracetamol (acetaminophen) may cause long-term neurodevelopmental problems. Furthermore, recent studies in animal models demonstrate that cognitive development is exquisitely sensitive to paracetamol exposure during early development. In this study, evidence for the claim that paracetamol is safe was evaluated using a systematic literature search. Publications on PubMed between 1974 and 2017 that contained the keywords “infant” and either “paracetamol” or “acetaminophen” were considered. Of those initial 3096 papers, 218 were identified that made claims that paracetamol was safe for use with infants or children. From these 218, a total of 103 papers were identified as sources of authority for the safety claim. Conclusion: A total of 52 papers contained actual experiments designed to test safety, and had a median follow-up time of 48 h. None monitored neurodevelopment. Furthermore, no trial considered total exposure to drug since birth, eliminating the possibility that the effects of drug exposure on long-term neurodevelopment could be accurately assessed. On the other hand, abundant and sufficient evidence was found to conclude that paracetamol does not induce acute liver damage in babies or children when used as directed.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundThe American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommends that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) may be beneficial in non-acetaminophen-related drug-induced liver injury. A subsequent review and analysis reported the current evidence to be inconclusive. Herein, we present an updated review and meta-analysis.MethodsWe evaluated prospective, retrospective and randomized controlled trials that compared outcomes in patients of all ages with acute liver failure (defined as abnormal liver enzymes along with elevated international normalized ratio >1.5, with or without hepatic encephalopathy) receiving NAC with the outcomes in a control group. The primary outcome was to compare the overall survival in the 2 groups. Secondary outcomes included difference in length of hospital stay, transplant-free survival, and post-transplant survival.ResultsSeven studies (N=883) that met the inclusion criteria were included in this analysis. The mean age of patients in the NAC group was 21.22 years compared with 23.62 years in the control group. The odds of overall survival were significantly higher in the NAC group than in controls (odds ratio [OR] 1.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-2.41). Post-transplant survival (OR 2.44, 95%CI 1.11-5.37) and transplant-free survival were also better in the NAC group than in the control group (OR 2.85, 95%CI 2.11-3.85). Patients in the control group had statistically significant odds of a longer inpatient stay (mean difference 7.79, 95%CI 6.93-8.66).ConclusionIn patients with non-acetaminophen-related acute liver failure, NAC significantly improves overall survival, post-transplant survival and transplant-free survival while decreasing the overall length of hospital stay.",systematic_review

Abstract: IntroductionThe association between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and the development of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) remains a subject of considerable debate. Despite extensive research, the evidence regarding this relationship is conflicting.ObjectivesTo perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing the incidence of ADHD and ASD in patients that were either exposed or not exposed to acetaminophen prenatally.MethodsWe systematically searched Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane Central for eligible studies up until August 2024. Only studies which included participants with a medical diagnosis of ADHD/ASD and reported acetaminophen exposure as a binary measure were included. Available summary data was extracted from published reports and pooled with a random-effects model using odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Abstract: IntroductionDrug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a rare but serious adverse event that can progress to acute liver failure (ALF). The evidence for treatment of DILI in children is scarce.ObjectiveWe aimed to comprehensively review the available literature on the therapies for both acetaminophen overdose (APAP) and idiosyncratic DILI in the paediatric population.MethodsWe included original articles conducted in a paediatric population (< 18 years) in which a therapeutic intervention was described to manage APAP or idiosyncratic DILI. Findings were summarized based on age groups (preterm newborn neonates, term and post-term neonates, infants, children and adolescents).ResultsOverall, 25 publications (fifteen case reports, six case series and four retrospective cohort studies) were included, including a total of 140 paediatric DILI cases, from preterm newborn neonates to adolescents. N-acetylcysteine was used to treat 19 APAP cases. N-acetylcysteine (n = 14), ursodeoxycholic acid (n = 3), corticosteroids (n = 31), carnitine (n = 16) and the combination of glycyrrhizin, reduced glutathione, polyene phosphatidylcholine and S-adenosylmethionine (n = 31) were the therapeutic options for treating idiosyncratic DILI. The molecular adsorbent recirculating system was used in the management of either APAP (n = 4) or idiosyncratic DILI (n = 2), while 20 paediatric ALF cases received continuous renal replacement therapy.ConclusionsThis systematic review identified DILI in the paediatric population who have received specific treatment.

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to review the published papers investigating maternal acetaminophen (AP) use during pregnancy and its effect on the offspring's neurodevelopment, particularly autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Acetaminophen is an over-the-counter analgesic and antipyretic considered safe in pregnancy. Recent studies have found an association between acetaminophen and immune system alterations like asthma and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. We used online databases (PubMed/Medline/PubMed Central, Science Direct, and Google Scholar) to search the studies relevant to our topic. We screened the papers by titles, abstracts, and then full-text availability. The screened articles were checked for eligibility using relevant quality assessment tools for each study design, extracting and analyzing the data. We finalized 30 studies after the screening; 14 were ineligible. Our final selection included 16 high-quality papers - 13 prospective cohort studies, two review articles, and one meta-analysis.We found a wide range of neurodevelopmental outcomes in our data collection. So, we included autism spectrum disorders, intelligent quotient (IQ), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), isolated language, attention and executive function, communication, behavior, and psychomotor development. All studies showed an association between acetaminophen use and listed neurodevelopmental outcomes. Long-term use, increased dose, and frequency were associated with a stronger association. We extracted collective evidence from 16 studies suggesting acetaminophen's role in developing adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.",systematic_review

Abstract: AbstractBackground:This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficiency and safety of intravenous acetaminophen as an adjunct to multimodal analgesia for pain control after total joint arthroplasty (TJA).Methods:PubMed, Embase, Web of science, Medline, and Cochrane library databases were systematically searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs were included. Fixed/random effect model was used according to the heterogeneity tested by I2 statistic. Meta-analysis was performed using Stata 11.0 software.Results:Four studies including 865 patients met the inclusion criteria. The present meta-analysis indicated that there were significant differences between groups in terms of pain scores at 24 hours (weighted mean difference [WMD] = −0.926, 95% confidence interval [CI]: −1.171 to −0.681, P = .000), 48 hours (WMD = −0.905, 95% CI: −1.198 to −0.612, P = .000), and 72 hours (WMD = −0.279, 95% CI: −0.538 to −0.021, P = .034). Significant differences were found regarding opioid consumption at 24 hours (WMD = −4.043, 95% CI: −5.041 to −3.046, P = .000), 48 hours (WMD = −5.665, 95% CI: −7.383 to −3.947, P = .000), and 72 hours (WMD = −6.338, 95% CI: −7.477 to −5.199, P = .000).Conclusion:Intravenous acetaminophen was efficacious for reducing postoperative pain and opioid consumption than the placebo following total joint arthroplasty.

Abstract: IntroductionAcetaminophen poisoning is commonly treated by emergency physicians. First-line therapy is N-acetylcysteine (NAC), traditionally administered intravenously via a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved three-bag protocol in which each bag has a unique concentration and infusion duration. Recently, simplified, off-label two-bag NAC infusion protocols have become more common. The purpose of this review is to summarize the effectiveness and safety of two-bag NAC.MethodsWe undertook a comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE from inception to December 13, 2022, for articles describing human acetaminophen poisonings treated with two-bag NAC, defined as any regimen involving two discrete infusions in two separate bags. Outcomes included effectiveness (measured by incidence of liver injury); incidence of non-allergic anaphylactoid reactions (NAAR); gastrointestinal, cutaneous, and systemic reactions; treatments for NAARs; incidence of NAC-related medication errors; and delays or interruptions in NAC administration.ResultsTwelve articles met final inclusion, 10 of which compared two-bag NAC to the three-bag regimen. Nine articles evaluated the two-bag/20-hour regimen, a simplified version of the FDA-approved three-bag regimen in which the traditional first and second bags are combined into a single four-hour infusion. Nine articles assessed comparative effectiveness of two-bag NAC in terms of liver injury, most commonly assessed for by incidence of hepatotoxicity (aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase >1,000 international units per liter). No difference in liver injury was observed between two-bag and three-bag regimens.",systematic_review

In seven articles evaluating treatment for NAARs (antihistamines, corticosteroids, epinephrine), all showed that patients received fewer medications for NAARs with two-bag NAC. Three articles evaluated NAC-related medication errors; two demonstrated no difference, while one study evaluating only children showed fewer errors with two-bag NAC. Two studies evaluated delays and/or interruptions in NAC infusions; both favored two-bag NAC.ConclusionFor patients with acetaminophen poisoning, two-bag NAC regimens appear to have similar outcomes to the traditional three-bag regimen in terms of liver injury. Two-bag NAC regimens are associated with fewer adverse events and fewer treatments for those events than the three-bag regimen and fewer interruptions in antidotal therapy.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundAlthough intravenous (IV) acetaminophen (AAP) may help reduce severe postoperative pain and opioid use after cardiovascular surgery, its effectiveness must be further validated. Therefore, the authors aimed to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of perioperative IV AAP in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery by conducting this meta-analysis.MethodsA comprehensive literature search was conducted of PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for studies published up to March 21, 2024. Six randomized controlled trials comparing IV AAP with a placebo in cardiovascular surgery were included. The mean difference (MD) was calculated to estimate pooled effect sizes. The primary outcome was opioid consumption, measured in morphine equivalent dose, and the secondary outcome was postoperative pain score.ResultsPostoperative opioid consumption was significantly reduced with IV AAP than it was with a placebo (MD −21.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] −38.41 to −4.95, P = 0.011). Significant reductions in postoperative pain scores were observed at 6 hours (MD −0.76, 95% CI −1.43 to −0.10, P = 0.025) and 24 hours (MD −0.63, 95% CI −1.02 to −0.25, P = 0.001) after surgery. However, these reductions did not meet clinically meaningful thresholds. No significant differences were observed at 12, 18, and 48 hours postoperatively.ConclusionsIV AAP was more effective than a placebo for postoperative adjunct analgesia in patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundIbuprofen, a well-known analgesic, is commonly used as a component of a multimodal analgesic approach for postoperative pain. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate whether a single-dose preoperative intravenous ibuprofen can reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption.MethodsPubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), and Web of Science databases were searched to identify relevant studies published up to May 2020. Randomized controlled trials comparing preoperative single-dose intravenous ibuprofen effect with the control group on postoperative pain and opioid consumption after surgery under general anesthesia were included.ResultsSix studies involving 366 participants were included. Single-dose administration of intravenous ibuprofen preoperatively significantly reduced postoperative pain score on a scale of 0-10 at 1 h (MD: -1.64, 95% CI [-2.56, -0.72], P < 0.001, I2 = 95%), at 4-6 h (MD: -1.17, 95% CI [-2.09, -0.26], P < 0.001, I2 = 94%), and 24 h (MD: -0.58, 95% CI [-0.99, -0.18], P < 0.001, I2 = 90%). Cumulative opioid consumption, presented as fentanyl equivalents, was also reduced significantly in the ibuprofen group compared to placebo group until postoperative 4-6 h (MD: -56.35 μg, 95% CI [-101.10, -11.60], P < 0.001, I2 = 91%) and 24 h (MD: -131.39 μg, 95% CI [-224.56, -38.21], P < 0.001, I2 = 95%).ConclusionsPreoperative single-dose intravenous ibuprofen can reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption until 24 h postoperatively.

Abstract: Objective:This systematic review aims to evaluate the effects of ibuprofen compared to other drugs on the risk and intensity of postoperative pain resulting from endodontic treatment in adult patients.Methods:A systematic search was carried out through Medline databases (Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, Lilacs, and BBO). There was no restriction on the publication year or idiom. The gray literature was explored. The Periodicos Capes Theses Databases and ProQuest Dissertations were also searched, as well as the unpublished and ongoing trials registry and the IADR abstracts (1990–2016). Solely randomized clinical trials that compared the risk or intensity of pain resulting from endodontic treatment in adult patients were included in this systematic review. The risk of bias of the articles was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool. A random-effect meta-analysis was conducted for ibuprofen versus placebo and ibuprofen versus other drugs at 6, 8, and 24 hours. The GRADE approach was used to assess the quality of the evidence.Results:A total of 1132 studies were identified, and only seven meet the eligibility criteria. No difference between the groups was detected in any of the meta-analysis. An exception was observed when one study was removed from the meta-analysis of pain intensity at 24 hours for ibuprofen versus placebo, favoring ibuprofen (SMD −0.67; 95% CI −1.05 to −0.17). The quality of evidence in all meta-analyses was graded as low or very low.Conclusion:Results of the present systematic review indicate that there is no clear evidence supporting that preoperative ibuprofen is better than other drugs in reducing the risk and intensity of postendodontic pain.",systematic_review

Abstract: AbstractThis study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple or single‐dosage intravenous ibuprofen (IVIB) in managing postoperative pain and fever in adults who are unable to take oral medications. A systematic review and meta‐analysis was conducted based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IVIB with placebo or other analgesic and antipyretic medications for postoperative pain and fever management. Data were collected from 8 main databases from the inception to June 2022. Risk of bias assessment was performed, and the GRADE methodology was used to assess the certainty of pooled evidence. Primary outcomes included visual analogue scale (VAS) scores within 24 h postoperative and reduction of temperature. Meta‐analyses were conducted to calculate the mean difference (MD) or risk ratios (RR) and 95% CIs. As a result, a total of twenty‐three RCTs with 3716 participants were included. For postoperative pain, with moderate‐to‐low certainty evidence, IVIB was associated with lower postoperative VAS scores than placebo, with MD ranging from −3.53 (95% CI, −4.32 to −2.75) at 0 min to −0.96 (95% CI, −1.35 to −0.57) at 24 h. Compared with intravenous acetaminophen, IVIB demonstrated lower VAS scores (MD, −1.54 at 0 min; −0.36 at 24 h). For fever, IVIB showed satisfactory antipyretic efficiency in a short period of time, but no difference was observed between IVIB and intravenous acetaminophen. IVIB was well‐tolerated for both pain and fever management. In conclusion, moderate‐to‐low certainty evidence supports the use of IVIB for adults with postoperative pain and fever who are unable to take oral medications.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundIbuprofen is one of the most commonly used analgesic and antipyretic drugs in children. However, its potential causal role in childhood asthma pathogenesis remains uncertain. In this systematic review, we assessed the association between ibuprofen administration in children and the risk of developing or exacerbating asthma.MethodsWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to May 2022, with no language limits; searched relevant reviews; and performed citation searching. We included studies of any design that were primary empirical peer-reviewed publications, where ibuprofen use in children 0–18 years was reported. Screening was performed in duplicate by blinded review. In total, 24 studies met our criteria. Data were extracted according to PRISMA guidelines, and the risk of bias was assessed using RoB2 and NOS tools. Quantitative data were pooled using fixed effect models, and qualitative data were pooled using narrative synthesis. Primary outcomes were asthma or asthma-like symptoms. The results were grouped according to population (general, asthmatic, and ibuprofen-hypersensitive), comparator type (active and non-active) and follow-up duration (short- and long-term).ResultsComparing ibuprofen with active comparators, there was no evidence of a higher risk associated with ibuprofen over both the short and long term in either the general or asthmatic population. Comparing ibuprofen use with no active alternative over a short-term follow-up, ibuprofen may provide protection against asthma-like symptoms in the general population when used to ease symptoms of fever or bronchiolitis.",systematic_review

However, use in children with asthma may lead to asthma exacerbation. The results are driven by a very small number of influential studies, and research in several key clinical contexts is limited to single studies. Both clinical trials and observational studies are needed to understand the potential role of ibuprofen in childhood asthma pathogenesis.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12890-024-03179-3.",systematic_review

Abstract: IntroductionPatients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or other rheumatic diseases say that pain and stiffness are symptoms affecting their quality of life. Ketoprofen and ibuprofen are the most commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce inflammation and manage mild-to-moderate pain. The aim of this new systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was to compare the clinical efficacy of ketoprofen and ibuprofen in patients with RA.MethodsThe MEDLINE and EMBASE scientific databases were systematically searched from their inception to November 2020 to identify RCTs directly comparing the recommended therapeutic doses of oral ketoprofen (50–200 mg/day) with ibuprofen (600–1800 mg/day) for RA pain relief. The meta-analysis was made using the standardized mean differences (SMD) of each of the identified RCTs using a fixed effects model.ResultsFour RCTs involving 456 patients met the inclusion criteria. The results of the meta-analysis showed a statistically significant difference in efficacy in favor of ketoprofen (0.33, 95% CI 0.14–0.52, p = 0.0005) at all point-estimates of the mean-weighted size effect. The heterogeneity test for the efficacy outcome (the hypothesis was χ2 = 3.57%, df = 3, p value = 0.31 and the chance of a test effect was 3.49, p = 0.0005) was not significant, and this was confirmed by a Higgins percentage of 16%.",systematic_review

Abstract: AbstractBackground:Needling and ibuprofen are often used clinically to treat primary dysmenorrhea (PD). However, the difference between the efficacy and safety of the treatment of PD is not clear. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of simple-needling for PD patients through a comparison with ibuprofen.Methods:A comprehensive search of 7 electronic databases and relevant medical journals, from the establishment of the publication to December 2020. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to evaluate the methodological quality of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that met the inclusion criteria, and a meta-analysis was performed with the Review Manager version (RevMan version 5.3).Results:Twenty three RCTs were included. The meta-analysis reported that simple-needling groups had better than ibuprofen groups on cure rate (relative risk = 2.29, 95% CI [1.96, 2.68], P < .00001) and total effective rate (relative risk = 1.24, 95% CI [1.19, 1.29], P < .00001) and VAS score (MD = −1.24, 95% CI [−1.92, −0.55], P = .0004). Seven studies reported adverse events, of which 4 studies had mild adverse events.Conclusion:Simple-needling is superior to ibuprofen treatment in terms of clinical efficacy and improvement of pain symptoms. A small number of studies reported whether simple-needling produced adverse events, so there is not enough evidence to support the safety of simple-needling in the treatment of PD.PROSPERO registration number:CRD42021233403",systematic_review

Abstract: This study aimed to systematically review the literature to assess the effect of preemptive intravenous ibuprofen on pain reduction after lower third molar surgery. Nine databases (PubMed, Scopus, LILACS, SciELO, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, Open Gray, and Open Thesis) were used as sources of research, including “grey literature.” The protocol was registered in PROSPERO. Only randomized clinical trials evaluating the effects of preemptive intravenous ibuprofen on pain during and immediately after the extraction of lower third molars were included, without restrictions of year and language. Two reviewers independently performed the study selection, data extraction, and assessment of the risk of bias. The “Joanna Briggs Institute for Randomized Controlled Trials” tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Each study was categorized according to the percentage of positive responses to the questions corresponding to the assessment instrument. The results were measured narratively/descriptively. The initial search resulted in 3,257 records, of which only three studies (n=150 participants) met the eligibility criteria and were included in the qualitative analysis. All studies were published in 2019. The risk of bias ranged from low to moderate. Two studies found significant pain reduction within 48 h after the procedure. In conclusion, the use of preemptive intravenous ibuprofen for extracting third molars reduces pain and analgesic consumption after the surgical procedure.",systematic_review

Abstract: Background:This research aimed to assess the efficacy of ibuprofen and low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in pain reduction following the placement of elastomeric separators, utilizing a network meta-analysis (NMA) to synthesize data from relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Our objective was to determine the most effective method for pain management in orthodontic patients.Methods:This study was registered with International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (registration number: CRD42025640519). A comprehensive literature search was conducted across various databases up to January 19, 2025, to identify RCTs evaluating the impact of ibuprofen and LLLT on pain intensity following orthodontic separator placement. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A NMA was performed to combine direct and indirect comparisons, ranking the interventions based on their effectiveness in alleviating pain at 6 hours and 24 hours after orthodontic separator placement.Results:Twenty-three studies with 1007 participants were included in the NMA. Both ibuprofen and LLLT demonstrated significantly greater reductions in pain intensity compared to control or placebo groups at all assessed time points. For ibuprofen, pain reduction was observed at 6-hour with a mean difference (MD) of –1.93 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of –2.93 to –0.93, and at 24-hour with an MD of –1.63 (95% CI: –2.58 to –0.68). For LLLT, the MD at 6-hour was –1.46 (95% CI: –2.28 to –0.64), and at 24-hour, the MD was –1.84 (95% CI: –2.52 to –1.16).",systematic_review

Ibuprofen offers more immediate pain reduction, whereas LLLT offers more sustained effects over 24-hour. These findings suggest that a time-dependent, multimodal approach may be beneficial for optimizing orthodontic pain management.

Abstract: Musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries are one of the most frequent reason for pain-related evaluation in the emergency department (ED) in children. There is still no consensus as to what constitutes the best analgesic for MSK pain in children. However, ibuprofen is reported to be the most commonly prescribed analgesic and is considered the standard first-line treatment for MSK injury pain in children, even if it is argued that it provides inadequate relief for many patients. The purpose of this study was to review the most recent literature to assess the efficacy of ibuprofen for pain relief in MSK injuries in children evaluated in the ED. We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials on pharmacological interventions in children and adolescents under 19 years of age with MSK injuries according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The primary outcome was the risk ratio for successful reduction in pain scores. Six studies met the inclusion criteria and provided data on 1028 children. A meta-analysis was not performed since studies were not comparable due to the different analgesic treatment used. No significant difference in term of main pain score reduction between all the analgesics used in the included studies was noted. Patients who received oral opioids had side effects more frequently when compared to children who received ibuprofen. The combination of effect on pain relief and tolerability would suggest ibuprofen as the initial drug of choice in providing relief from mild-to-moderate MSK pain in children in the ED. The results obtained in this review and current research suggest that there’s no straightforward statistically significant evidence of the optimal analgesic agent to be used.",systematic_review

Abstract: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are popularly used in the management of acute postoperative pain. Intravenous (IV) ketorolac has been used for several years for this purpose. Recently, IV ibuprofen has been introduced for the management of postoperative pain. This review aims to compare the efficacy of these two NSAIDs in managing acute postoperative pain. After registering the protocol in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), databases like PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Ovid were searched using relevant keywords. Twenty-four-hour opioid consumption was the primary outcome. Pain scores, patient satisfaction, rescue analgesia requirements, and adverse events were the secondary outcomes assessed. Out of 124 articles that were retrieved, six articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The Risk of Bias 2 (RoB-2) was used for risk of bias assessment, Review Manager (RevMan) was used for a quantitative meta-analysis, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to assess the strength of evidence. The risk of bias was high in all categories. The 24-hour opioid requirement, which was the primary outcome, was comparable between both groups (mean difference: -4.72; 95% CI: -5.65, -3.80; P=0.79), with significant heterogeneity (I2=93%). The secondary outcomes were comparable among both groups. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) strength of evidence was moderate for the pain score at movement and low to very low for other outcomes.",systematic_review

Abstract: No data addressing issues concerning disparities in participant and trial characteristics and trial outcome reporting have been established in clinical trials for H1-antihistamine-refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). To better harmonize and compare the different treatment interventions, we systematically evaluated the overall landscape of pharmacological treatments for H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU clinical trials published between 2000 and 2021. This systematic review included 23 randomized clinical trials involving 2480 participants from 22 countries. We found significant increases in the number of globally published and newly tested drugs, especially biologic drugs. Regarding relatively small trials, we found that people living with H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU who were identified as members of minority groups (non-white population), populations of regions other than North America/Europe, and populations of low- to lower/upper-middle-income countries are underrepresented. Most trials were designed to evaluate treatment efficacy and safety profiles; however, less than half of the included trials reported the patient’s perspective in terms of patient-reported outcomes. Disparities in outcome reporting, including clinimetric tools for assessing treatment response and outcome sets, were observed. To close the evidence gap in H1-antihistamine-refractory CSU trials, strategies for improving trial and participant enrollment and standardizing core outcome sets for trial reporting are needed.",systematic_review

Abstract: BackgroundAs a new generation antihistamine, fexofenadine has been widely used in allergic diseases. However, there is still a lack of collective evidence regarding the antihistamine effects and safety profiles of fexofenadine relative to other antihistamine drugs and placebo. Therefore, we aimed to systematically evaluate the antihistamine effects and safety of fexofenadine.MethodsAn electronic literature search of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed using Embase, Cochrane and PubMed from establishment to January 1st, 2018. RCTs comparing the antihistamine effects or safety (adverse events, sedative effects, and cognitive/psychomotor function) of fexofenadine with either other antihistamines or placebo for healthy subjects and patients with allergy were selected.ResultsFifty-one studies of 14,551 participants met the inclusion criteria. When compared with the first-generation antihistamines, fexofenadine produced significantly lower adverse events frequency (OR = 0.446; 95% CI: 0.214 to 0.929, P = 0.031), significantly lower sedative effects frequency (OR = 0.265; 95% CI: 0.072 to 0.976, P = 0.046) and significantly less change of all cognitive/psychomotor function. When compared with the second-generation antihistamines, fexofenadine produced significantly marginal sedative effects (OR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.93; P = 0.02) and significantly less change of most of the cognitive/psychomotor function.

Abstract: H-1 antihistamines are commonly used in dermatological practice for itch and urticaria control. The widespread expression of H-1 receptor on different cells in the skin and various biologic functions of H-1 antihistamines indicate the possible treatment potentials of H-1 antihistamines in dermatology. A literature search was performed on PubMed and Embase, targeting articles reporting use of antihistamine for purposes other than itch and urticaria control in dermatological practice. Several off-label usages of antihistamines were identified, including alopecia, acne, Darier disease, eosinophilic dermatoses, paraneoplastic dermatoses, psoriasis, lichen nitidus, radiation dermatitis, skin dysesthesia, and cutaneous malignancies. Additional benefits were observed when H-1 antihistamines were used either alone or in combination with other therapeutic modalities. Although various novel uses of H-1 antihistamines have been uncovered, the evidence level of most included studies is weak. Further randomized control trials are warranted to better evaluate the efficacy and dosage of H-1 antihistamine for dermatological disorders.",systematic_review

Abstract: IntroductionNarrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) phototherapy has been used for the treatment of chronic urticaria (CU), but the clinical efficacy of this treatment modality requires further evidence. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NB-UVB as add-on therapy in the treatment of CU.MethodsA literature search was conducted in the Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, CBM, VIP and WanFang databases up to October 2020. A total of nine studies involving 713 participants met the inclusion criteria.ResultsTwo trials showed a significant difference in the Urticaria Activity Score between therapy with NB-UVB + antihistamines and that with antihistamines alone (mean difference 8.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.78–10.68, p < 0.00001). Six trials (563 participants) showed a significant benefit of NB-UVB as add-on therapy to antihistamines in the total effective rate (risk ratio [RR] 1.56, 95% CI 1.39–1.75, p < 0.00001). In terms of adverse events, no statistically significant differences were found for NB-UVB + antihistamines versus antihistamines alone (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.67–1.79, p = 0.71). Combination therapy of NB-UVB + antihistamines yielded a significantly lower risk of recurrence (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.14–0.44, p < 0.00001).ConclusionOur meta-analysis suggests that combination therapy of NB-UVB + antihistamines is significantly more effective in treating CU than antihistamines alone.",systematic_review
