The uterus, or womb, is the place where a fetus grows during pregnancy . In an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg grows in the wrong place outside the uterus. It usually occurs in the fallopian tubes. These tubes carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus. Sometimes, an ectopic pregnancy can occur in the ovaries, abdominal cavity, or the lower part of the uterus (cervix). Ectopic pregnancies can't end in a healthy pregnancy because the egg cannot grow.

Some birth defects like cleft lip or neural tube defects are structural problems that can be easy to see. Others, like heart disease , are found using special tests. Birth defects can range from mild to severe. How a birth defect affects a child's life depends mostly on which organ or body part is involved and how severe the defect is. What causes birth defects? For some birth defects, researchers know the cause. But for many birth defects, the exact cause is unknown. Researchers think that most birth defects are caused by a complex mix of factors, which can include: Genetics. One or more genes might have a change or mutation that prevents them from working properly. For example, this happens in Fragile X syndrome . With some defects, a gene or part of the gene might be missing. Chromosomal problems. In some cases, a chromosome or part of a chromosome might be missing. This is what happens in Turner syndrome . In other cases, such as with Down syndrome , the child has an extra chromosome. Exposures to medicines , chemicals, or other toxic substances . For example, alcohol misuse can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders . Infections during pregnancy .

HIV harms your immune system by destroying a type of white blood cell that helps your body fight infection. This puts you at risk for other infections and diseases. What is AIDS? AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. It happens when the body's immune system is badly damaged because of the virus. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS. How does HIV spread? HIV is spread through certain body fluids from a person who has HIV. This can happen: By having unprotected vaginal or anal sex with a person who has HIV. ""Unprotected"" means not using condoms or medicine to treat or prevent HIV. This is the most common way that it spreads. By sharing drug needles. Through contact with the blood of a person with HIV. From mother to fetus during pregnancy . From mother to baby during, childbirth, or breastfeeding. Who is at risk for HIV infection? Anyone can get HIV, but certain groups have a higher risk of getting it: People who have another sexually transmitted infection (STI). Having an STI can increase your risk of getting or spreading HIV. People who inject drugs with shared needles. Gay and bisexual men. Black/African Americans and Hispanic/Latino Americans. They make up a higher proportion of new HIV diagnoses and people with HIV, compared to other races and ethnicities. People who engage in risky sexual behaviors, such as not using condoms or medicine to prevent or treat HIV. Factors such as stigma, discrimination, income, education, and geographic region can also affect people's risk for HIV. What are the symptoms of HIV? The first signs of HIV infection may be flu-like symptoms: Fever Chills Rash Night sweats (heavy sweating during sleep) Muscle aches Sore throat Fatigue Swollen lymph nodes Mouth ulcers These symptoms may come and go within two to four weeks. This stage is called acute HIV infection.",condition

Often, there are no symptoms during this stage. If it is not treated, eventually the virus will weaken your body's immune system. Then the infection will progress to AIDS. This is the late stage of HIV infection. Because your immune system is badly damaged, your body cannot fight off other infections, called opportunistic infections (OIs). OIs are infections that happen more frequently or are more severe in people who have weakened immune systems. Some people may not feel sick during the earlier stages of HIV infection. So the only way to know for sure whether you have HIV is to get tested. How do I know if I have HIV? A blood test can tell if you have HIV infection. Your health care provider can do the test, or you can use a home testing kit. You can also use the CDC Testing Locator to find free testing sites. What are the treatments for HIV? There is no cure for HIV infection, but it can be treated with medicines. This is called antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART can make HIV infection a manageable chronic condition. It also reduces the risk of spreading the virus to others. Most people with HIV live long and healthy lives if they get ART as soon as possible and stay on it. It's also important to take care of yourself. Making sure that you have the support you need, living a healthy lifestyle, and getting regular medical care can help you enjoy a better quality of life . Can HIV infection be prevented? You can reduce the risk of getting or spreading HIV by: Getting tested for HIV. Choosing less risky sexual behaviors. This includes limiting the number of sexual partners you have and using latex condoms every time you have sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.

Growth disorders are problems that prevent children from developing normal height, weight, sexual maturity or other features. Very slow or very fast growth can sometimes signal a gland problem or disease. The pituitary gland makes growth hormone, which stimulates the growth of bone and other tissues. Children who have too little of it may be very short. Treatment with growth hormone can stimulate growth. People can also have too much growth hormone. Usually the cause is a pituitary gland tumor, which is not cancer. Too much growth hormone can cause gigantism in children, where their bones and their body grow too much.

It secretes digestive juices into the small intestine through a tube called the pancreatic duct. The pancreas also releases the hormones insulin and glucagon into the bloodstream. Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. It happens when digestive enzymes start digesting the pancreas itself. Pancreatitis can be acute or chronic. Either form is serious and can lead to complications. Acute pancreatitis occurs suddenly and usually goes away in a few days with treatment. It is often caused by gallstones . Common symptoms are severe pain in the upper abdomen, nausea, and vomiting. Treatment is usually a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and medicines to relieve pain. Chronic pancreatitis does not heal or improve. It gets worse over time and leads to permanent damage. The most common cause is heavy alcohol use . Other causes include cystic fibrosis and other inherited disorders, high levels of calcium or fats in the blood, some medicines, and autoimmune conditions . Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and oily stools. Treatment may also be a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids, medicines to relieve pain, and nutritional support.

Respiratory failure is a condition in which your blood doesn't have enough oxygen or has too much carbon dioxide. Sometimes you can have both problems. When you breathe, your lungs take in oxygen. The oxygen passes into your blood, which carries it to your organs. Your organs, such as your heart and brain, need this oxygen-rich blood to work well. Another part of breathing is removing the carbon dioxide from the blood and breathing it out. Having too much carbon dioxide in your blood can harm your organs. What causes respiratory failure? Conditions that affect your breathing can cause respiratory failure. These conditions may affect the muscles, nerves, bones, or tissues that support breathing. Or they may affect the lungs directly. These conditions include: Diseases that affect the lungs , such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), cystic fibrosis , pneumonia , pulmonary embolism , and COVID-19 Conditions that affect the nerves and muscles that control breathing, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), muscular dystrophy , spinal cord injuries , and stroke Problems with the spine, such as scoliosis (a curve in the spine). They can affect the bones and muscles used for breathing. Damage to the tissues and ribs around the lungs. An injury to the chest can cause this damage. Drug or alcohol overdose Inhalation injuries , such as from inhaling smoke (from fires) or harmful fumes What are the symptoms of respiratory failure? The symptoms of respiratory failure depend on the cause and the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood. A low oxygen level in the blood can cause shortness of breath and air hunger (the feeling that you can't breathe in enough air). Your skin, lips, and fingernails may also have a bluish color. A high carbon dioxide level can cause rapid breathing and confusion. Some people who have respiratory failure may become very sleepy or lose consciousness.",condition

Your health care provider will diagnose respiratory failure based on: Your medical history A physical exam, which often includes Listening to your lungs to check for abnormal sounds Listening to your heart to check for arrhythmia Looking for a bluish color on your skin, lips, and fingernails Diagnostic tests, such as Pulse oximetry, a small sensor that uses a light to measure how much oxygen is in your blood. The sensor goes on the end of your finger or on your ear. Arterial blood gas test, a test that measures the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in your blood. The blood sample is taken from an artery, usually in your wrist. Once you are diagnosed with respiratory failure, your provider will look for what is causing it. Tests for this often include a chest x-ray. If your provider thinks you may have arrhythmia because of the respiratory failure, you may have an EKG (electrocardiogram). This is simple, painless test that detects and records your heart's electrical activity. What are the treatments for respiratory failure? Treatment for respiratory failure depends on: Whether it is acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing) How severe it is What is causing it Acute respiratory failure can be a medical emergency. You may need treatment in intensive care unit at a hospital. Chronic respiratory failure can often be treated at home.

All of these hormones do many important jobs, including: Turning food into energy and managing blood sugar levels Balancing salt and water Keeping blood pressure normal Responding to illness and stress (your ""fight or flight"" response) Timing when and how fast a child develops sexually Supporting pregnancy What are adrenal gland disorders? When you have an adrenal gland disorder, your body makes too much or too little of one or more hormones. The symptoms depend on the type of problem you have and how much it affects the hormone levels in your body. There are many types of adrenal gland disorders, including: Addison's Disease - a condition in which the adrenal glands don't make enough cortisol Cushing's Syndrome - a condition caused by too much cortisol in the body, often from taking steroid medicines for a long time Aldosterone-producing adenoma - a benign tumor (not cancer) that makes too much aldosterone and may cause serious high blood pressure Hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma - an inherited condition causing different types of tumors that make adrenaline and other hormones. Some tumors may become cancerous. Adrenal gland cancer - cancerous tumors, including adrenocortical carcinoma and neuroblastoma Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) - a group of inherited disorders in which the adrenal glands don't make enough cortisol. The most common type is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (also called CAH1) . In the United States, newborn babies get a blood test to see if they have CAH.",condition

Changes in genes (mutations). These changes can cause the adrenal glands to make too much or too little of one or more hormones. Infections In many cases the cause of the problem isn't clear. How are adrenal gland disorders diagnosed? Health care providers use different tests to check for adrenal disorders depending on your symptoms and health history. For example, you may have tests of your blood, urine (pee), or saliva (spit). These tests check your hormone levels. Your provider may order x-rays , CT scans , or MRI scans to look for tumors.

Leukodystrophies are a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS is made up of your brain and spinal cord. Leukodystrophies damage the white matter of your CNS. The white matter includes: Nerve fibers, also called axons, which connect your nerve cells Myelin, a layer of proteins and fatty materials that covers and protects the nerve fibers. It also helps speed up signals between the nerve cells. When the white matter is damaged, it can slow down or block the signals between nerve cells. This can cause many different symptoms, including trouble with movement , vision , hearing , and thinking. There are over 50 types of leukodystrophies. Some types are present at birth, while others may not cause symptoms until a child becomes a toddler. A few types mainly affect adults. Most types get worse over time. What causes leukodystrophies? Leukodystrophies are caused by genetic changes. These changes are usually inherited, meaning that they are passed from parent to child. What are the symptoms of leukodystrophies? The symptoms of leukodystrophies depend on the type; they can include a gradual loss of: Muscle tone Balance and mobility Walking Speech Ability to eat Vision Hearing Behavior There can also be other symptoms, such as: Learning disabilities Bladder issues Breathing problems Developmental disabilities Muscle control disorders Seizures How are leukodystrophies diagnosed?

Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. For example, there are vaccines to protect against diseases caused by: Viruses , like the ones that cause the flu and COVID-19 Bacteria , including tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis What are the types of vaccines? There are several types of vaccines: Live-attenuated vaccines use a weakened form of the germ. Inactivated vaccines use a killed version of the germ. Subunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines use only specific pieces of the germ, such as its protein, sugar, or casing. Toxoid vaccines use a toxin (harmful product) made by the germ. mRNA vaccines use messenger RNA, which gives your cells instructions for how to make a protein (or piece of a protein) of the germ. Viral vector vaccines use genetic material, which gives your cells instructions for making a protein of the germ. These vaccines also contain a different, harmless virus that helps get the genetic material into your cells. These vaccines may work in different ways, but they all spark an immune response. The immune response is the way your body defends itself against substances it sees as foreign or harmful. These substances include germs that can cause disease. What happens in an immune response? There are different steps in the immune response: When a germ invades, your body sees it as foreign. Your immune system helps your body fight off the germ. Your immune system also remembers the germ. It will attack the germ if it ever invades again. This ""memory"" protects you against the disease that the germ causes. This type of protection is called immunity. What are immunization and vaccination? Immunization is the process of becoming protected against a disease. But it can also mean the same thing as vaccination, which is getting a vaccine to become protected against a disease. Why are vaccines important?",condition
medlineplus_0056_2,Vaccines,MedlinePlus,https://medlineplus.gov/vaccines.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Vaccines are important because they protect you against many diseases. These diseases can be very serious. So getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease. For a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would. But vaccines don't just protect you. They also protect the people around you through community immunity. What is community immunity? Community immunity, or herd immunity, is the idea that vaccines can help keep communities healthy. Normally, germs can travel quickly through a community and make a lot of people sick. If enough people get sick, it can lead to an outbreak. But when enough people are vaccinated against a certain disease, it's harder for that disease to spread to others. This type of protection means that the entire community is less likely to get the disease. Community immunity is especially important for people who can't get certain vaccines. For example, they may not be able to get a vaccine because they have weakened immune systems. Others may be allergic to certain vaccine ingredients. And newborn babies are too young to get some vaccines. Community immunity can help to protect them all. Are vaccines safe? Vaccines are safe . They must go through extensive safety testing and evaluation before they are approved in the United States. What is a vaccine schedule? A vaccine, or immunization, schedule lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. It includes who should get the vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes the vaccine schedule. It's important for both children and adults to get their vaccines according to the schedule.

To infect a cell, HIV has to bind to two types of molecules on the cell's surface. Blocking either of these molecules prevents HIV from entering the cells. Attachment inhibitors bind to a specific protein on the outer surface of HIV. This prevents HIV from entering the cell. Pharmacokinetic enhancers are another type of medicine. They are sometimes taken along with certain other HIV medicines. Pharmacokinetic enhancers increase the effectiveness of the other medicine. They work by slowing the breakdown of the other medicine. This allows that medicine to stay in the body longer at a higher concentration. There are also multidrug combinations , which include a combination of two or more different types of HIV medicines.

NAFLD is a type of fatty liver disease that is not related to heavy alcohol use. There are two kinds: Simple fatty liver, in which you have fat in your liver but little or no inflammation or liver cell damage. Simple fatty liver typically does not get bad enough to cause liver damage or complications. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), in which you have inflammation and liver cell damage, as well as fat in your liver. Inflammation and liver cell damage can cause fibrosis, or scarring, of the liver. NASH may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer . What is alcoholic fatty liver disease?

But if you have a food allergy, your immune system mistakenly reacts to certain foods as if they were harmful. This reaction is usually mild. But in some cases, it can be serious or even life-threatening. A food intolerance is different than a food allergy. If you have a food intolerance, you also have symptoms when you eat that food. But these are typically just digestive symptoms such as bloating and gas . Also, an intolerance is not an immune system reaction. Most food allergies are caused by: Cow's milk Chicken eggs Crustacean shellfish, such as shrimp, crab, lobster, and crayfish Fish Peanuts Sesame Soy Tree nuts, such as almonds, walnuts, pecans Wheat People with a food allergy may be allergic to more than one type of food. Who is more likely to develop a food allergy? Both children and adults can have food allergies. Some children will outgrow their food allergies. And sometimes people can develop food allergies as adult. Certain factors can make you more likely to have a food allergy. They include: Having eczema , a disease that causes inflammation, redness, and irritation of the skin. Your immune system also plays a role in eczema. Having asthma or other allergies , such as hay fever . Your genes. Certain genes may influence the development of food allergies. And you are more likely to have food allergies if someone in your family has allergies, asthma, or eczema. What are the symptoms of food allergies? If you are allergic to a food you have eaten, you may have a variety of symptoms. These symptoms are not always the same for every person.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency, or AATD) is an inherited condition that raises your risk for lung and liver disease. If you have this condition, your body doesn't make enough alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). AAT is made by your liver. It helps protect your lungs from inflammation and irritating substances you might breathe in, such as smoke. If your liver doesn't make enough AAT, your lungs may be more easily damaged from smoking , pollution , or dust from the environment. This can lead to a serious lung condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ). AAT deficiency may also cause a liver disease called cirrhosis . This is more common in children who have AAT deficiency. What causes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency)? AAT deficiency is a genetic disorder . That means it's caused by changes in your genes, which may also be called gene variants or mutations. Your genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. AAT deficiency is caused by changes in the SERPINA1 gene , which carries instructions for making the AAT protein. These gene changes are inherited from your parents, so AAT deficiency tends to run in families: If you have two mutated copies of the gene, it means you have a condition called AAT deficiency. People with this disorder have a higher risk of getting lung disease or liver damage before the age of 45. If you have one mutated copy of the gene, you are a carrier of AAT deficiency. In these cases, this means you are at slightly higher risk of developing lung disease, especially if you have other risk factors, such as being a smoker. You could still pass the mutated gene on to your children. There are a few gene changes that cause AAT deficiency. These gene changes can: Decrease the amount of AAT protein your liver makes. Prevent your liver from making any AAT.",condition

Anesthesia is the use of medicines, called anesthetics, to prevent pain during surgery and other medical procedures. Medicine may be given by injection, inhalation, topical lotion, spray, eye drops, or a skin patch. Anesthesia can cause a loss of feeling, awareness, or both. Sedation may be used with anesthesia. Unlike full anesthesia, sedation doesn't make you completely unconscious, and recovery is faster. It helps reduce pain, keep you calm, and make you less aware during procedures such as minor surgeries, endoscopies , imaging , or dental work. Levels of sedation include: Minimal sedation. You are awake but more relaxed. Moderate sedation (conscious sedation). You may feel sleepy and not remember much, but you can still respond when spoken to or touched. Deep sedation. You are very drowsy and may respond only to repeated or stronger stimulation. What is anesthesia used for? Anesthesia may be used for: Minor procedures, such as filling a tooth. Childbirth or procedures such as colonoscopies . Minor and major surgeries. In some cases, a dentist, nurse, or doctor may give you an anesthetic. In other cases, you may need an anesthesiologist. This is a doctor who specializes in giving anesthesia. What are the types of anesthesia? There are several different types of anesthesia: Local anesthesia numbs a small area like a tooth or a cut that needs stitches. You are awake during local anesthesia. Regional anesthesia numbs a larger area, like an arm, a leg, or everything below the waist. You may be awake during the procedure, or you may be given sedation. It may be used during childbirth, a Cesarean delivery (C-section), or minor surgeries. General anesthesia affects your whole body. It feels like a deep sleep, but you do not feel anything.

Angioplasty is a procedure to improve blood flow in coronary arteries that have become narrow or blocked. Your coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart. If you have coronary artery disease , a sticky material called plaque builds up in your coronary arteries. Plaque is made of cholesterol , calcium, and other substances in your blood. Over time, it can narrow your arteries or fully block them. When this happens, some parts of your heart don't get enough blood. Angioplasty widens the blocked part of your artery so more blood can get through. It is also called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). What conditions does angioplasty treat? Doctors (usually a heart specialist called a cardiologist) use angioplasty to: Reduce chest pain from blockages in the coronary arteries. This type of pain is called angina . There are different types of angina. Angioplasty treats certain types. Limit damage to the heart during or right after a heart attack . In this case, angioplasty is an emergency treatment. Angioplasty does not cure coronary artery disease. To help prevent more plaque blockages , you'll need to take any prescribed medicines, eat healthy foods, and get regular exercise . What happens during angioplasty? Most people have angioplasties in a hospital in a special room called a cardiac catheterization, or cath, lab. You will be awake and lying down. You'll get medicine to help you relax through an intravenous (IV) line. This is a small tube that goes into a vein in your hand or arm. Angioplasty is done through a blood vessel in your arm, wrist, or groin. Your doctor will: Make a small opening in that area to insert a thin tube (a catheter) into a blood vessel. Thread the tube through the vessel to your heart, using x-rays as a guide. Inject contrast dye inside your arteries. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the x-rays.

This makes the artery wider and improves blood flow. Sometimes put a small, mesh tube into the artery to help keep it open. The tube is called a stent. Some stents have a coating of medicine that helps prevent blood clots from forming. What happens after an angioplasty? If you had an angioplasty for chest pain, you'll go to a recovery room for a few hours. You may stay in the hospital overnight. Your doctor will probably prescribe medicines to prevent blood clots . Most people can return to their usual activities after a week. If you had an emergency angioplasty for a heart attack, you'll need to stay in the hospital for about a few more days. Are there any risks from angioplasty? Angioplasty is very safe, but every invasive procedure comes with risks. You may get a bruise , feel sore, or have some bleeding where the tubes were inserted.

Healthy lifestyle changes can help reduce high blood pressure: Losing weight Being physically active Managing stress Reducing sodium in your diet Avoiding alcohol , tobacco , and illegal drugs Getting enough sleep What if lifestyle changes alone cannot lower blood pressure? Sometimes lifestyle changes alone cannot control or lower your high blood pressure. In that case, your health care provider may prescribe blood pressure medicines. How do blood pressure medicines work? The most commonly used blood pressure medicines work in different ways to lower blood pressure: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) keep your blood vessels from narrowing as much and allows blood to move through them with less pressure. Beta blockers help your heart beat slower and with less force. This means that your heart pumps less blood through your blood vessels. Beta blockers are typically used only as a backup option or if you also have certain other conditions. Calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows the blood vessels to relax. Diuretics remove extra water and sodium (salt) from your body. This lowers the amount of fluid in your blood. Diuretics are often used with other high blood pressure medicines, sometimes in one combined pill. Often, two or more medicines work better than one.

Heart valve disease happens when one or more of your heart valves don't work well. Your heart has four valves: the tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, and aortic valves. The valves have flaps that open and close. The flaps make sure that blood flows in the right direction through your heart and to the rest of your body. When your heart beats, the flaps open to let blood through. Between heartbeats they close to stop the blood from flowing backwards. If one or more of your heart valves doesn't open or close correctly, it can affect your blood flow and strain your heart. Fortunately, treatment helps most valve diseases. What are the types of heart valve diseases? Heart valves can have three basic kinds of problems: Regurgitation , or backflow, happens when the flaps of a valve don't close tightly. This allows the blood to leak backwards. A common cause of regurgitation is prolapse, where the flaps of the valve flop or bulge back. Prolapse most often affects the mitral valve . Stenosis happens when the flaps of a valve become thick, stiff, or stuck together. This prevents the heart valve from opening all the way. Not enough blood can pass through the valve. Aortic valve stenosis is a common type of stenosis. It affects the valve that controls blood flow into the large artery that carries blood out of the heart to the body. Atresia happens when a heart valve did not form properly and does not have an opening for blood to pass through. Sometimes a valve can have both regurgitation and stenosis. What causes heart valve diseases? Some people are born with heart valve disease. This is called congenital heart valve disease. It can happen alone or along with other congenital heart defects . Heart valve disease can also develop over time as you get older or have certain conditions that affect the heart. Who is more likely to develop heart valve diseases? Your chance of having heart valve disease is higher if: You are older.",condition

You have or have had other conditions that affect your heart and blood vessels. These include: Rheumatic fever. An untreated strep throat can become rheumatic fever, which can harm the heart valves. The damage may not show up for years. Today, most people take antibiotics to cure strep throat before it can cause heart valve damage. Endocarditis . This is a rare infection in the lining of the heart and heart valves. It is usually caused by bacteria in the bloodstream. A heart attack. Heart failure . Coronary artery disease , especially when it affects the aorta (the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the body). High blood pressure. High blood cholesterol . Diabetes . Obesity and overweight. Lack of physical activity . A family history of early heart disease: A father or brother who had heart disease younger than 55. A mother or sister who had heart disease younger than 65. You were born with an aortic valve that wasn't formed right. Sometimes this will cause problems right away. Other times, the valve may work well enough for years before causing problems. What are the symptoms of heart valve diseases? Many people live their whole lives with a heart valve that doesn't work perfectly and never have any problems. But heart valve disease may get worse slowly over time. You may develop signs and symptoms, such as: Shortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air) Fatigue Swelling in your feet, ankles, abdomen (belly), or the veins in your neck Chest pain when you're physically active Arrhythmia , a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat Dizziness or fainting If you don't get treatment for heart valve disease, the symptoms and strain on your heart may keep getting worse.

Your health care provider may listen to your heart with a stethoscope and hear that your heart makes abnormal sounds, such as a click or a heart murmur. These sounds may mean a valve isn't working normally. The provider will usually refer you to a cardiologist, a doctor who specializes in heart diseases. The doctor will also listen to your heart and will do a physical exam. You will also likely need to have one or more heart tests . What are the treatments for heart valve diseases? Most heart valve problems can be treated successfully. Treatment may include: Medicines to control your symptoms and keep your heart pumping well Heart-healthy lifestyle changes to treat other related heart conditions Surgery to repair or replace a valve It's possible that you may need surgery, even if you don't have symptoms. Fixing the valve can help prevent future heart problems. There are many ways to do heart valve surgery. You and your doctor can decide what's best for you, based on your valve problem and general health. Heart valve repair surgery has fewer risks than heart valve replacement. So, when repair is possible, it's preferred over valve replacement. In some cases, valve replacement is necessary. There are 2 types of replacement valves: Biologic valves made from pig, cow, or human tissue. These valves tend to wear out after 10 to 15 years, but some may last longer. Mechanical (human-made) valves usually don't wear out. But with a mechanical valve, you usually have to take blood thinners for the rest of your life to prevent blood clots.

Aphasia is a language disorder that makes it hard for you to read, write, and say what you mean to say. Sometimes it makes it hard to understand what other people are saying, too. Aphasia is not a disease. It's a symptom of damage to the parts of the brain that control language. The signs of aphasia depend on which part of the brain is damaged. There are four main types of aphasia: Expressive aphasia is when you know what you want to say, but you have trouble saying or writing your thoughts. Receptive aphasia affects your ability to read and understand speech. You can hear what people say or see words on a page, but you have trouble making sense of what they mean. Global aphasia is the loss of almost all language ability. You can't speak, understand speech, read, or write. Anomic or amnesia aphasia is when you have trouble using the right words for certain things, people, places or events. In some cases, aphasia may get better on its own. But it can be a long-term condition. There's no cure, but treatment may help improve language skills. What causes aphasia? Aphasia happens from damage to one or more parts of the brain involved with language. The damage may be from: Stroke , which is the most common cause of aphasia Brain tumor Brain infection or inflammation Brain injury Other brain disorders or neurologic diseases that affect the brain and get worse over time, such as dementia Who is more likely to develop aphasia? Anyone can have aphasia at any age, but most people with aphasia are middle-aged or older. Most aphasia happens suddenly from a stroke or brain injury. Aphasia from a brain tumor or other brain disorder may develop slowly over time. How is aphasia diagnosed?

These tests measure how much the brain damage has affected the ability to talk, read, write, and understand. In most cases, the tests are done by a speech-language pathologist or speech therapist (a specialist who treats speech and communication disorders ). What are the treatments for aphasia? Some people fully recover from aphasia without treatment. But most people should begin speech-language therapy to treat aphasia as soon as possible. Treatment may be one-on-one with a speech therapist or in a group. Therapy using a computer may also be helpful. The specific therapy depends on the type of language loss that a person has. It may include exercises in reading, writing, following directions, and repeating what the therapist says. Therapy may also include learning how to communicate with gestures, pictures, smartphones, or other electronic devices. Family participation may be an important part of speech therapy. Family members can learn to help with recovery in many ways, such as: Using simpler language Including the person with aphasia in conversations Repeating or writing down key words to help communicate more clearly Language abilities may continue to improve over many years. In general, people recover their ability to understand language more fully than their ability to speak.

An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. Your heart beats too quickly, too slowly, or with an irregular pattern. Changes in the electrical signals that control your heartbeat cause arrhythmias. When your heart beats faster than normal, it's called tachycardia . When your heart beats too slowly, it's called bradycardia . When the signal to beat comes too early, it's called a premature or extra heartbeat . It may feel like your heart skipped a beat. There are many types of arrhythmias. Arrhythmias may affect the upper or lower chamber of your heart. The most common type of arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation , which causes an irregular and fast heartbeat. Some arrhythmias are harmless, such as when your heart rate speeds up during exercise and slows down when you sleep. But if you have a frequent irregular rhythm, it may mean your heart isn't pumping enough blood into your body. Getting treatment and following a heart-healthy lifestyle can help control arrhythmias. It may also help prevent heart damage that can trigger some heart arrhythmias. What causes an arrhythmia?

Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are defects in your vascular system . Your vascular system is your body's network of blood vessels. It includes your: Arteries, which carry oxygen-rich blood from your heart to your tissues and organs. Veins, which carry the blood and waste products back to your heart. Capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels that connect your small arteries to your small veins. An AVM is an abnormal tangle of arteries and veins. They are connected to each other, with no capillaries between them. Without the capillaries, the blood flow from the arteries goes directly into the veins at a faster rate than normal. Because of this, the nearby tissue does not get all the oxygen it would normally get. This lack of oxygen can lead to tissue damage and the death of nerve cells and other cells. The fast rate of blood flow can also increase the blood pressure inside the arteries and veins. This can weaken the arteries and veins. A weakened artery or blood vessel could burst or leak blood. What causes arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)? AVMs are rare. The cause of AVMs is unknown. Most of the time, people are born with them. But sometimes they can appear shortly after birth or later in life. What are the symptoms of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)? The symptoms of AVM will depend on where the AVM is located.

This cloudiness blocks light from reaching the back of the eye, making it harder to see clearly. A cataract can affect one or both eyes, but it doesn't spread from one eye to the other. Cataracts usually develop slowly. As they get worse, your vision can become blurry or dim. Brighter lighting or new eyeglasses may help at first, but if cataracts begin to interfere with your daily activities, you may need cataract surgery.

You may have them every day or only once in a while. When you are having an asthma attack, your symptoms get much worse. The attacks may come on gradually or suddenly. Sometimes they can be life-threatening. They are more common in people who have severe asthma. If you are having asthma attacks, you may need a change in your treatment. How is asthma diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose asthma: Physical exam Medical history Lung function tests , including spirometry, to test how well your lungs work Tests to measure how your airways react to specific exposures. During this test, you inhale different concentrations of allergens or medicines that may tighten the muscles in your airways. Spirometry is done before and after the test. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) tests to measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effort Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests to measure levels of nitric oxide in your breath when you breathe out. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that your lungs are inflamed. Allergy skin or blood tests, if you have a history of allergies. These tests check which allergens cause a reaction from your immune system. What are the treatments for asthma?

Genetics and environment likely play a role in which children get asthma. An asthma attack can happen when your child is exposed to an asthma trigger. An asthma trigger is something that can set off or worsen asthma symptoms. Different triggers can cause different types of asthma: Allergic asthma is caused by allergens. Allergens are substances that cause an allergic reaction. They can include Dust mites Mold Pets Pollen from grass, trees, and weeds Waste from pests such as cockroaches and mice Nonallergic asthma is caused by triggers that are not allergens, such as Breathing in cold air Certain medicines Household chemicals Infections such as colds and the flu Outdoor air pollution Tobacco smoke Exercise-induced asthma happens during physical exercise, especially when the air is dry Asthma triggers may be different for each child and can change over time.

Your immune system protects you from disease and infection by attacking germs that get into your body, such as viruses and bacteria. Your immune system can tell that the germs aren't part of you, so it destroys them. If you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks the healthy cells of your organs and tissues by mistake. There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases. They can affect almost any part of your body. For example, alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease of the skin that causes hair loss. Autoimmune hepatitis affects the liver. In type 1 diabetes , the immune system attacks the pancreas. And in rheumatoid arthritis , the immune system can attack many parts of the body, including the joints, lungs, and eyes. What causes autoimmune diseases? No one is sure why autoimmune diseases happen. But you can't catch them from other people. Autoimmune diseases do tend to run in families, which means that certain genes may make some people more likely to develop a problem. Viruses, certain chemicals, and other things in the environment may trigger an autoimmune disease if you already have the genes for it. Who is at risk for autoimmune diseases? Millions of Americans of all ages have autoimmune diseases. Women develop many types of autoimmune diseases much more often than men. And if you have one autoimmune disease, you are more likely to get another. What are the symptoms of autoimmune diseases? The symptoms of an autoimmune disease depend on the part of your body that's affected. Many types of autoimmune diseases cause redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which are the signs and symptoms of inflammation. But other illnesses can cause the same symptoms.

Hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid, happens when your thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormones to meet your body's needs. Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way the body uses energy. These hormones affect nearly every organ in your body and control many of your body's most important functions. For example, they affect your breathing, heart rate, weight, digestion, and moods. Without enough thyroid hormones, many of your body's functions slow down. But there are treatments that can help. What causes hypothyroidism? Hypothyroidism has several causes. They include: Hashimoto's disease, an autoimmune disorder where your immune system attacks your thyroid. This is the most common cause. Thyroiditis, inflammation of the thyroid Congenital hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism that is present at birth Surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid Radiation treatment of the thyroid Certain medicines In rare cases, a pituitary disease or too much or too little iodine in your diet Who is at risk for hypothyroidism?

Sometimes it can cause trouble with breathing or swallowing. Because hypothyroidism develops slowly, many people don't notice symptoms of the disease for months or even years. What other problems can hypothyroidism cause? Hypothyroidism can contribute to high cholesterol . In rare cases, untreated hypothyroidism can cause myxedema coma. This is a condition in which your body's functions slow down to the point that it becomes life-threatening. During pregnancy, hypothyroidism can cause complications , such as premature birth , high blood pressure in pregnancy , and miscarriage . It can also slow the baby's growth and development . How is hypothyroidism diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, including asking about your symptoms A physical exam Thyroid tests , such as TSH , T3 , T4 , and thyroid antibody blood tests Imaging tests , such as a thyroid scan, ultrasound , or radioactive iodine uptake test. A radioactive iodine uptake test measures how much radioactive iodine your thyroid takes up from your blood after you swallow a small amount of it. What are the treatments for hypothyroidism? The treatment for hypothyroidism is medicine to replace the hormone that your own thyroid can no longer make. About 6 to 8 weeks after you start taking the medicine, you will get a blood test to check your thyroid hormone level. Your health care provider will adjust your dose if needed. Each time your dose is adjusted, you'll have another blood test. Once you find the right dose, you will probably get a blood test in 6 months.",condition

Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a condition in which the heart suddenly stops beating. When that happens, blood stops flowing to the brain and other vital organs. If it is not treated, SCA usually causes death within minutes. But quick treatment with a defibrillator may be lifesaving. How is sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) different from a heart attack? A heart attack is different from an SCA. A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart is blocked. During a heart attack, the heart usually doesn't suddenly stop beating. With an SCA, the heart stops beating. Sometimes an SCA can happen after or during recovery from a heart attack. What causes sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? Your heart has an electrical system that controls the rate and rhythm of your heartbeat. An SCA can happen when the heart's electrical system is not working right and causes irregular heartbeats. Irregular heartbeats are called arrhythmias . There are different types. They may cause the heart to beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm. Some can cause the heart to stop pumping blood to the body; this is the type that causes SCA. Certain diseases and conditions can cause the electrical problems that lead to SCA. They include: Ventricular fibrillation , a type of arrhythmia where the ventricles (the heart's lower chambers) don't beat normally. Instead, they beat very fast and very irregularly. They can't pump blood to the body. This causes most SCAs. Coronary artery disease (CAD) , also called ischemic heart disease. CAD happens when the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. It is often caused by the buildup of plaque , a waxy substance, inside the lining of larger coronary arteries. The plaque blocks some or all of the blood flow to the heart. Some types of physical stress can cause your heart's electrical system to fail, such as Intense physical activity in which your body releases the hormone adrenaline.",condition

Major blood loss Severe lack of oxygen Certain inherited disorders which can cause arrhythmias or problems with the structure of your heart Structural changes in the heart , such as an enlarged heart due to high blood pressure or advanced heart disease. Heart infections can also cause changes to the structure of the heart. Who is at risk for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? You are at higher risk for SCA if you: Have coronary artery disease (CAD). Most people with SCA have CAD. But CAD usually doesn't cause symptoms, so they may not know that they have it. Are older; your risk increases with age Are a man; it is more common in men than women Are Black or African American, especially if you have other conditions such as diabetes , high blood pressure, heart failure , or chronic kidney disease Have a personal history of heartbeats that aren't regular (arrhythmia) Have a personal or family history of SCA or inherited disorders that can cause arrhythmia Have a problem with drug or alcohol use Have had a heart attack Have heart failure What are the symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? Usually, the first sign of SCA is loss of consciousness ( fainting ). This happens when the heart stops beating. Some people may have a racing heartbeat or feel dizzy or light-headed just before they faint. And sometimes people have chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea, or vomiting in the hour before they have an SCA. How is sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) diagnosed? SCA happens without warning and requires emergency treatment. Health care providers rarely diagnose SCA with medical tests as it's happening. Instead, it is usually diagnosed after it happens. Providers do this by ruling out other causes of a person's sudden collapse.",condition

The cardiologist may ask you to get various heart health tests to see how well you heart is working. He or she will work with you to decide whether you need treatment to prevent SCA. What are the treatments for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? SCA is an emergency. A person having SCA needs to be treated with a defibrillator right away. A defibrillator is a device sends an electric shock to the heart. The electric shock can restore a normal rhythm to a heart that's stopped beating. To work well, it needs to be done within minutes of the SCA. Most police officers, emergency medical technicians, and other first responders are trained and equipped to use a defibrillator. Call 9-1-1 right away if someone has signs or symptoms of SCA. The sooner you call for help, the sooner lifesaving treatment can begin. What should I do if I think that someone has had an SCA? Many public places such as schools, businesses, and airports have automated external defibrillators (AEDs). AEDs are special defibrillators that untrained people can use if they think that someone has had SCA. AEDS are programmed to give an electric shock if they detect a dangerous arrhythmia. This prevents giving a shock to someone who may have fainted but isn't having SCA. If you see someone who you think has had SCA, you should give cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) until defibrillation can be done. People who are at risk for SCA may want to consider having an AED at home. Ask your cardiologist to help you decide whether having an AED in your home might help you. What are the treatments after surviving sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? If you survive SCA, you'll likely be admitted to a hospital for ongoing care and treatment. In the hospital, your medical team will closely watch your heart. They may give you medicines to try to reduce the risk of another SCA.",condition

These procedures help restore blood flow through narrowed or blocked coronary arteries. Often, people who have had SCA get a device called an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) . This small device is surgically placed under the skin in your chest or abdomen. An ICD uses electric pulses or shocks to help control dangerous arrhythmias. Can sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) be prevented? You may be able to lower your risk of SCA by following a heart-healthy lifestyle .

Hyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid, happens when your thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs. Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way the body uses energy. These hormones affect nearly every organ in your body and control many of your body's most important functions.

This is the most common cause. Thyroid nodules, which are growths on your thyroid. They are usually benign (not cancer). But they may become overactive and make too much thyroid hormone. Thyroid nodules are more common in older adults. Thyroiditis, inflammation of the thyroid. It causes stored thyroid hormone to leak out of your thyroid gland. Too much iodine. Iodine is found in some medicines, cough syrups, seaweed and seaweed-based supplements. Taking too much of them can cause your thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone. Too much thyroid medicine.

A radioactive iodine uptake test measures how much radioactive iodine your thyroid takes up from your blood after you swallow a small amount of it. What are the treatments for hyperthyroidism? The treatments for hyperthyroidism include medicines, radioiodine therapy, and thyroid surgery: Medicines for hyperthyroidism include Antithyroid medicines, which cause your thyroid to make less thyroid hormone. You probably need to take the medicines for 1 to 2 years. In some cases, you might need to take the medicines for several years. This is the simplest treatment, but it is often not a permanent cure. Beta blocker medicines, which can reduce symptoms such as tremors, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness. They work quickly and can help you feel better until other treatments take effect. Radioiodine therapy is a common and effective treatment for hyperthyroidism. It involves taking radioactive iodine by mouth as a capsule or liquid. This slowly destroys the cells of the thyroid gland that produce thyroid hormone. It does not affect other body tissues. Almost everyone who has radioactive iodine treatment later develops hypothyroidism. This is because the thyroid hormone-producing cells have been destroyed. But hypothyroidism is easier to treat and causes fewer long-term health problems than hyperthyroidism. Surgery to remove part or most of the thyroid gland is done in rare cases.

For more in-depth information, see our health professional fact sheet . What are vitamin A and carotenoids and what do they do? Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in many foods. Vitamin A is important for normal vision, the immune system , reproduction, and growth and development. Vitamin A also helps your heart, lungs , and other organs work properly. Carotenoids are pigments that give yellow, orange, and red fruits and vegetables their color. Your body is able to convert some carotenoids into vitamin A. There are two different sources for vitamin A: Preformed vitamin A is found in fish, organ meats (such as liver ), dairy products, and eggs. Provitamin A carotenoids are turned into vitamin A by your body. They are found in fruits, vegetables, and other plant-based products. The most common provitamin A carotenoid in foods and dietary supplements is beta-carotene . How much vitamin A do I need? The amount of vitamin A you need depends on your age and sex. Average daily recommended amounts of preformed vitamin A and provitamin A carotenoids are listed below in micrograms (mcg) of retinol activity equivalents (RAE).

Vitamin A is available in dietary supplements , usually in the form of retinyl acetate or retinyl palmitate (preformed vitamin A), beta-carotene (provitamin A), or a combination of preformed and provitamin A. Most multivitamin/mineral supplements contain vitamin A. Dietary supplements that contain only vitamin A are also available. Am I getting enough vitamin A? Vitamin A deficiency is rare in the United States because most people get enough vitamin A from the foods they eat. However, vitamin A deficiency is common in many developing countries, especially in young children. Certain groups of people are more likely than others to have trouble getting enough vitamin A: Premature infants Infants, young children, pregnant women, and breastfeeding women in developing countries People with cystic fibrosis People with Crohn’s disease , ulcerative colitis , or celiac disease What happens if I don’t get enough vitamin A? The most common sign of vitamin A deficiency is an eye condition called xerophthalmia. Xerophthalmia is the inability to see in low light, and it can lead to blindness if it isn’t treated . A long-term deficiency of vitamin A can also lead to a higher risk of respiratory diseases (such as pneumonia ) and infections (such as measles and diarrhea ).

What are some effects of vitamin A on health? Scientists are studying vitamin A to understand how it affects health. Here are some examples of what this research has shown. Cancer People who eat a lot of foods containing vitamin A or beta-carotene might have a lower risk of certain kinds of cancer. However, studies do not show that vitamin A or beta-carotene supplements help prevent cancer or lower the chances of dying of cancer. In fact, some studies find that in people who smoke or used to smoke, high doses of beta-carotene supplements can increase the risk of lung cancer and death. Age-related macular degeneration Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the loss of central vision as people age. It’s the most common cause of vision loss in older people. Studies show that a supplement containing vitamins C and E, zinc , and copper with or without beta-carotene helps slow down the rate of vision loss in people with AMD who are at high risk of developing advanced AMD. The same supplement, containing lutein and zeaxanthin instead of beta-carotene, reduces the risk of progression to advanced AMD even more and eliminates the increased risk of lung cancer from high doses of beta-carotene. Measles In developing countries where vitamin A deficiency is common, children with measles are more likely to have severe symptoms and may die from the disease. In these children, taking vitamin A supplements can help prevent new cases of measles but probably doesn’t lower their risk of dying of measles. Can vitamin A be harmful? Yes, high intakes of some forms of vitamin A can be harmful.

Most people in the United States get enough vitamin B12 from the foods they eat. However, some people have trouble absorbing vitamin B12 from food. The body absorbs vitamin B12 from food in a two-step process. First, hydrochloric acid in the stomach separates vitamin B12 from the protein that it’s attached to. Second, the freed vitamin B12 then combines with a protein made by the stomach, called intrinsic factor , and the body absorbs them together. Vitamin B12 in dietary supplements isn’t attached to protein and doesn’t require the first step. However, B12 in supplements does need to combine with intrinsic factor to be absorbed. People with pernicious anemia , an autoimmune disease , can’t make intrinsic factor. As a result, they have trouble absorbing vitamin B12 from foods and dietary supplements. Vitamin B12 deficiency affects between 3% and 43% of older adults. Your doctor can test your vitamin B12 level to see if you have a deficiency. Certain groups of people may not get enough vitamin B12 or have trouble absorbing it: Many older adults don’t have enough hydrochloric acid in their stomach to absorb the vitamin B12 that’s naturally present in food.",supplement

People with an autoimmune disease called atrophic gastritis might not absorb enough vitamin B12 because they make too little hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor in their stomach. People with pernicious anemia do not make the intrinsic factor needed to absorb vitamin B12. As a result, they have trouble absorbing vitamin B12 from foods and dietary supplements. Doctors usually treat pernicious anemia with vitamin B12 shots, although very high doses of vitamin B12 given by mouth might also be effective. People who have had some types of stomach or intestinal surgery (for example, to lose weight or to remove part or all of the stomach) might not make enough hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor to absorb vitamin B12. People with disorders of the stomach and small intestine , such as celiac disease or Crohn’s disease , might not absorb enough vitamin B12. People who eat little or no animal foods, such as vegetarians and vegans , might not get enough vitamin B12 from their diets. Only animal foods have vitamin B12 naturally.

Some foods and beverages that are fortified with vitamin C. To find out if vitamin C has been added to a food product, check the product labels . The vitamin C content of food may be reduced by prolonged storage and by cooking. Steaming or microwaving may lessen cooking losses. Fortunately, many of the best food sources of vitamin C, such as fruits and vegetables, are usually eaten raw. What kinds of vitamin C dietary supplements are available? Most multivitamins have vitamin C. Vitamin C is also available alone as a dietary supplement or in combination with other nutrients. The vitamin C in dietary supplements is usually in the form of ascorbic acid, but some supplements have other forms, such as sodium ascorbate, calcium ascorbate, other mineral ascorbates, and ascorbic acid with bioflavonoids. Research has not shown that any form of vitamin C is better than the other forms. Am I getting enough vitamin C? Most people in the United States get enough vitamin C from foods and beverages. However, certain groups of people are more likely than others to have trouble getting enough vitamin C: People who smoke and those who are exposed to secondhand smoke , in part because smoke increases the amount of vitamin C that the body needs to repair damage caused by free radicals. People who smoke need 35 mg more vitamin C per day than nonsmokers. Infants who are fed evaporated or boiled cow's milk because cow's milk has very little vitamin C and heat can destroy vitamin C. Cow's milk is not recommended for infants under 1 year of age. Breast milk and infant formula have adequate amounts of vitamin C. People who eat a very limited variety of food.

People who get little or no vitamin C (below about 10 mg per day) for many weeks can get scurvy . Scurvy causes fatigue , inflammation of the gums, small red or purple spots on the skin, joint pain, poor wound healing, and corkscrew hairs. Additional signs of scurvy include depression as well as swollen, bleeding gums and loosening or loss of teeth. People with scurvy can also develop anemia . Scurvy is fatal if it is not treated . What are some effects of vitamin C on health? Scientists are studying vitamin C to understand how it affects health. Here are several examples of what this research has shown. Cancer prevention and treatment People with high intakes of vitamin C from fruits and vegetables might have a lower risk of getting many types of cancer, such as lung , breast, and colon cancer . However, taking vitamin C supplements, with or without other antioxidants, doesn't seem to protect people from getting cancer. It is not clear whether taking high doses of vitamin C is helpful as a treatment for cancer. Vitamin C's effects appear to depend on how it is administered to the patient. Oral doses of vitamin C can't raise blood levels of vitamin C nearly as high as intravenous doses given through injections . A few studies in animals and test tubes indicate that very high blood levels of vitamin C might shrink tumors . However, more research is needed to determine whether high-dose intravenous vitamin C helps treat cancer in people. Vitamin C dietary supplements and other antioxidants might interact with chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer. People being treated for cancer should talk with their oncologist before taking vitamin C or other antioxidant supplements, especially in high doses. Cardiovascular disease People who eat lots of fruits and vegetables seem to have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease .",supplement

However, scientists aren't sure whether vitamin C itself, either from food or supplements, helps protect people from cardiovascular disease. It is also not clear whether vitamin C helps prevent cardiovascular disease from getting worse in people who already have it. Age-related macular degeneration and cataracts Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) and cataracts are two of the leading causes of vision loss in older people. Researchers do not believe that vitamin C and other antioxidants affect the risk of getting AMD. However, research suggests that vitamin C combined with other nutrients might help slow AMD progression . In a large study among older people with AMD who were at high risk of developing advanced AMD, those who took a daily dietary supplement with 500 mg vitamin C, 80 mg zinc , 400 International Units ( IU ) vitamin E , 15 mg beta-carotene , and 2 mg copper for about 6 years had a lower chance of developing advanced AMD. They also had less vision loss than those who did not take the dietary supplement. People who have or are developing the disease might want to talk with their doctor about taking dietary supplements. The relationship between vitamin C and cataract formation is unclear. Some studies show that people who get more vitamin C from foods have a lower risk of getting cataracts. However, further research is needed to clarify this association and to determine whether vitamin C supplements affect the risk of getting cataracts. The common cold Although vitamin C has long been a popular remedy for the common cold , research shows that for most people, vitamin C supplements do not reduce the risk of getting the common cold. However, people who take vitamin C supplements regularly might have slightly shorter colds or somewhat milder symptoms when they do have a cold.",supplement

Vitamin C dietary supplements can interact or interfere with medicines that you take. Here are several examples: Vitamin C dietary supplements might interact with cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. It is not clear whether vitamin C might have the unwanted effect of protecting tumor cells from cancer treatments or whether it might help protect normal tissues from getting damaged. If you are being treated for cancer, check with your health care provider before taking vitamin C or other antioxidant supplements, especially in high doses.

For more in-depth information, see our health professional fact sheet . For information on vitamin D and COVID-19, see Dietary Supplements in the Time of COVID-19 . What is vitamin D and what does it do? Vitamin D is a nutrient you need for good health. It helps your body absorb calcium , one of the main building blocks for strong bones. Together with calcium, vitamin D helps protect you from developing osteoporosis , a disease that thins and weakens the bones and makes them more likely to break. Your body needs vitamin D for other functions too. Your muscles need it to move, and your nerves need it to carry messages between your brain and your body. Your immune system needs vitamin D to fight off invading bacteria and viruses . How much vitamin D do I need? The amount of vitamin D you need each day depends on your age. Average daily recommended amounts are listed below in micrograms (mcg) and International Units ( IU ). Life Stage Recommended Amount Birth to 12 months 10 mcg (400 IU) Children 1–13 years 15 mcg (600 IU) Teens 14–18 years 15 mcg (600 IU) Adults 19–70 years 15 mcg (600 IU) Adults 71 years and older 20 mcg (800 IU) Pregnant and breastfeeding teens and women 15 mcg (600 IU) What foods provide vitamin D? Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D. Fortified foods provide most of the vitamin D in the diets of people in the United States. Check the Nutrition Facts label for the amount of vitamin D in a food or beverage. Almost all of the U.S. milk supply is fortified with about 3 mcg (120 IU) vitamin D per cup. Many plant-based alternatives such as soy milk, almond milk, and oat milk are similarly fortified, but foods made from milk, like cheese and ice cream, are usually not fortified. Vitamin D is added to many breakfast cereals and to some brands of orange juice, yogurt, margarine, and other food products.",supplement

Beef liver, egg yolks, and cheese have small amounts of vitamin D. Mushrooms provide a little vitamin D. Some mushrooms have been exposed to ultraviolet light to increase their vitamin D content. Can I get vitamin D from the sun? Your body makes vitamin D when your bare skin is exposed to the sun. Most people get at least some vitamin D this way. However, clouds, smog, old age, and having dark-colored skin reduce the amount of vitamin D your skin makes. Also, your skin does not make vitamin D from sunlight through a window. Ultraviolet radiation from sunshine can cause skin cancer , so it’s important to limit how much time you spend in the sun. Although sunscreen limits vitamin D production, health experts recommend using sunscreen with a sun protection factor ( SPF ) of 15 or more when you’re out in the sun for more than a few minutes. What kinds of vitamin D dietary supplements are available? Vitamin D is found in multivitamin/mineral supplements. It is also available in dietary supplements containing only vitamin D or vitamin D combined with a few other nutrients. The two forms of vitamin D in supplements are D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol). Both forms increase vitamin D in your blood, but D3 might raise it higher and for longer than D2. Because vitamin D is fat soluble, it is best absorbed when taken with a meal or snack that includes some fat. Am I getting enough vitamin D? Because you get vitamin D from food, sunshine, and dietary supplements, one way to know if you’re getting enough is a blood test that measures the amount of vitamin D in your blood. In the blood, a form of vitamin D known as 25-hydroxyvitamin D is measured in either nanomoles per liter (nmol/L) or nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). One nmol/L is equal to 0.4 ng/mL. So, for example, 50 nmol/L is the same as 20 ng/mL.",supplement

Levels below 30 nmol/L (12 ng/mL) are too low and might weaken your bones and affect your health. Levels above 125 nmol/L (50 ng/mL) are too high and might cause health problems. In the United States, most people have adequate blood levels of vitamin D. However, almost one out of four people have vitamin D blood levels that are too low or inadequate for bone and overall health. Some people are more likely than others to have trouble getting enough vitamin D: Breastfed infants . Breast milk alone does not provide infants with an adequate amount of vitamin D. Breastfed infants should be given a supplement of 10 mcg (400 IU) of vitamin D each day. Older adults. As you age, your skin's ability to make vitamin D when exposed to sunlight declines. People who seldom expose their skin to sunshine because they do not go outside or because they keep their body and head covered. Sunscreen also limits the amount of vitamin D your skin produces. People with dark skin. The darker your skin, the less vitamin D you make from sunlight exposure. People with conditions that limit fat absorption , such as Crohn’s disease , celiac disease , or ulcerative colitis . This is because the vitamin D you consume is absorbed in the gut along with fat, so if your body has trouble absorbing fat, it will also have trouble absorbing vitamin D. People with obesity or who have undergone gastric bypass surgery. They may need more vitamin D than other people. What happens if I don’t get enough vitamin D? In children, vitamin D deficiency causes rickets , a disease in which the bones become soft, weak, deformed, and painful. In teens and adults, vitamin D deficiency causes osteomalacia , a disorder that causes bone pain and muscle weakness. What are some effects of vitamin D on health?

Bone health and osteoporosis Long-term shortages of vitamin D and calcium cause your bones to become fragile and break more easily. This condition is called osteoporosis. Millions of older women and men have osteoporosis or are at risk of developing this condition. Muscles are also important for healthy bones because they help maintain balance and prevent falls. A shortage of vitamin D may lead to weak, painful muscles. Getting recommended amounts of vitamin D and calcium from foods (and supplements, if needed) will help maintain healthy bones and prevent osteoporosis. Taking vitamin D and calcium supplements slightly increases bone strength in older adults, but it’s not clear whether they reduce the risk of falling or breaking a bone. Cancer Vitamin D does not seem to reduce the risk of developing cancer of the breast, colon , rectum, or lung . It is not clear whether vitamin D affects the risk of prostate cancer or chance of surviving this cancer. Very high blood levels of vitamin D may even increase the risk of pancreatic cancer . Clinical trials suggest that while vitamin D supplements (with or without calcium) may not affect your risk of getting cancer, they might slightly reduce your risk of dying from this disease. More research is needed to better understand the role that vitamin D plays in cancer prevention and cancer-related death. Heart disease Vitamin D is important for a healthy heart and blood vessels and for normal blood pressure. Some studies show that vitamin D supplements might help reduce blood cholesterol levels and high blood pressure —two of the main risk factors for heart disease. Other studies show no benefits. If you are overweight or have obesity, taking vitamin D at doses above 20 mcg (800 IU) per day plus calcium might actually raise your blood pressure.",supplement

Depression Vitamin D is needed for your brain to function properly. Some studies have found links between low blood levels of vitamin D and an increased risk of depression. However, clinical trials show that taking vitamin D supplements does not prevent or ease symptoms of depression. Multiple sclerosis People who live near the equator have more sun exposure and higher vitamin D levels. They also rarely develop multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease that affects the nerves that carry messages from the brain to the rest of the body. Many studies find a link between low blood vitamin D levels and the risk of developing MS. However, scientists have not actually studied whether vitamin D supplements can prevent MS. In people who have MS, clinical trials show that taking vitamin D supplements does not keep symptoms from getting worse or coming back. Type 2 diabetes Vitamin D helps your body regulate blood sugar levels. However, clinical trials in people with and without diabetes show that supplemental vitamin D does not improve blood sugar levels, insulin resistance , or hemoglobin A1c levels (the average level of blood sugar over the past 3 months). Other studies show that vitamin D supplements don’t stop most people with prediabetes from developing diabetes. Weight loss Taking vitamin D supplements or eating foods that are rich in vitamin D does not help you lose weight. Can vitamin D be harmful? Yes, getting too much vitamin D can be harmful. Very high levels of vitamin D in your blood (greater than 375 nmol/L or 150 ng/mL) can cause nausea , vomiting, muscle weakness, confusion, pain, loss of appetite, dehydration, excessive urination and thirst, and kidney stones .

For more in-depth information, see our health professional fact sheet . What is vitamin E and what does it do? Vitamin E is a fat-soluble nutrient found in many foods. In the body, it acts as an antioxidant , helping to protect cells from the damage caused by free radicals . Free radicals are compounds formed when our bodies convert the food we eat into energy. People are also exposed to free radicals in the environment from cigarette smoke, air pollution, and ultraviolet light from the sun. The body also needs vitamin E to boost its immune system so that it can fight off invading bacteria and viruses . It helps to widen blood vessels and keep blood from clotting within them. In addition, cells use vitamin E to interact with each other and to carry out many important functions. How much vitamin E do I need? The amount of vitamin E you need each day depends on your age.

What kinds of vitamin E dietary supplements are available? Vitamin E supplements come in different amounts and forms. Two main things to consider when choosing a vitamin E supplement are: The amount of vitamin E: Most once-daily multivitamin/mineral supplements provide about 13.5 mg of vitamin E, whereas vitamin E-only supplements commonly contain 67 mg or more. The doses in most vitamin E-only supplements are much higher than the recommended amounts. Some people take large doses because they believe or hope that doing so will keep them healthy or lower their risk of certain diseases. The form of vitamin E: Although vitamin E sounds like a single substance, it is actually the name of eight related compounds in food, including alpha-tocopherol . Each form has a different potency, or level of activity in the body. Vitamin E from natural sources is commonly listed as d -alpha-tocopherol on food packaging and supplement labels. Synthetic (laboratory-made) vitamin E is commonly listed as dl -alpha-tocopherol. The natural form is more potent; 1 mg vitamin E = 1 mg d -alpha-tocopherol (natural vitamin E) = 2 mg dl -alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E). Some food and dietary supplement labels still list vitamin E in International Units ( IUs ) rather than mg. One IU of the natural form of vitamin E is equivalent to 0.67 mg. One IU of the synthetic form of vitamin E is equivalent to 0.45 mg. Some vitamin E supplements provide other forms of the vitamin, such as gamma-tocopherol, tocotrienols, and mixed tocopherols. Scientists do not know if any of these forms are superior to alpha-tocopherol in supplements. Am I getting enough vitamin E? The diets of most Americans provide less than the recommended amounts of vitamin E. Nevertheless, healthy people rarely show any clear signs that they are not getting enough vitamin E (see next question for information on the signs of vitamin E deficiency ).",supplement

Vitamin E deficiency is very rare in healthy people. It is almost always linked to certain diseases in which fat is not properly digested or absorbed . Examples include Crohn's disease , cystic fibrosis , and certain rare genetic diseases such as abetalipoproteinemia and ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED). Vitamin E needs some fat for the digestive system to absorb it. Vitamin E deficiency can cause nerve and muscle damage that results in loss of feeling in the arms and legs, loss of body movement control , muscle weakness, and vision problems. Another sign of deficiency is a weakened immune system. What are some effects of vitamin E on health? Scientists are studying vitamin E to understand how it affects health. Here are several examples of what this research has shown. Heart disease Some studies link higher intakes of vitamin E from supplements to lower chances of developing coronary heart disease . However, the best research finds no benefit. People in these studies are randomly assigned to take vitamin E or a placebo (dummy pill with no vitamin E or active ingredients ) and they don't know which they are taking. Vitamin E supplements do not seem to prevent heart disease, reduce its severity, or affect the risk of death from this disease. Scientists do not know whether high intakes of vitamin E might protect the heart in younger, healthier people who do not have a high risk of heart disease. Cancer Most research indicates that vitamin E does not help prevent cancer and may be harmful in some cases. Large doses of vitamin E have not consistently reduced the risk of colon and breast cancer in studies, for example. A large study found that taking vitamin E supplements (180 mg/day [400 IU]) for several years increased the risk of developing prostate cancer in men.",supplement

However, one study found a link between the use of vitamin E supplements for 10 years or more and a lower risk of death from bladder cancer . Vitamin E dietary supplements and other antioxidants might interact with chemotherapy and radiation therapy . People undergoing these treatments should talk with their doctor or oncologist before taking vitamin E or other antioxidant supplements, especially in high doses. Eye disorders Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), or the loss of central vision in older people, and cataracts are among the most common causes of vision loss in older people. The results of research on whether vitamin E can help prevent these conditions are inconsistent. Among people with AMD who were at high risk of developing advanced AMD, a supplement containing large doses of vitamin E combined with other antioxidants, zinc , and copper showed promise for slowing down the rate of vision loss. Mental function Several studies have investigated whether vitamin E supplements might help older adults remain mentally alert and active as well as prevent or slow the decline of mental function and Alzheimer's disease . So far, the research provides little evidence that taking vitamin E supplements can help healthy people or people with mild mental functioning problems to maintain brain health. Can vitamin E be harmful? Vitamin E that is naturally present in food and beverages is not harmful and does not need to be limited. In supplement form, however, high doses of vitamin E might increase the risk of bleeding (by reducing the blood's ability to form clots after a cut or injury) and of serious bleeding in the brain (known as hemorrhagic stroke ). Because of this risk, the upper limit for adults is 1,000 mg/day for supplements of either natural or synthetic vitamin E.",supplement

In one study, for example, men who took 400 IU (180 mg) of synthetic vitamin E each day for several years had an increased risk of prostate cancer. Does vitamin E interact with medications or other dietary supplements? Vitamin E dietary supplements can interact or interfere with certain medicines that you take. Here are some examples: Vitamin E can increase the risk of bleeding in people taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medicines, such as warfarin (Coumadin).

Severe vitamin K deficiency can cause bruising and bleeding problems because the blood will take longer to clot. Vitamin K deficiency might reduce bone strength and increase the risk of getting osteoporosis because the body needs vitamin K for healthy bones. What are some effects of vitamin K on health? Scientists are studying vitamin K to understand how it affects our health. Here are some examples of what this research has shown. Osteoporosis Vitamin K is important for healthy bones. Some research shows that people who eat more vitamin K-rich foods have stronger bones and are less likely to break a hip than those who eat less of these foods. A few studies have found that taking vitamin K supplements improves bone strength and lessens the chances of breaking a bone, but other studies have not. More research is needed to better understand if vitamin K supplements can help improve bone health and reduce osteoporosis risk. Coronary heart disease Scientists are studying whether low blood levels of vitamin K increase the risk of coronary heart disease , perhaps by making blood vessels that feed the heart stiffer and narrower. More research is needed to understand whether vitamin K supplements might help prevent heart disease. Can vitamin K be harmful? Vitamin K has not been shown to cause any harm.

In dietary supplements, folate is usually in the form of folic acid, but methylfolate (5-MTHF) is also used. Dietary supplements containing 5-MTHF might be better than folic acid for some individuals who have a gene variant called MTHFR C677T because their bodies can use this form more easily. However, all women and teen girls who could become pregnant should get 400 mcg a day of folic acid, not 5-MTHF, even if they have an MTHFR C677T gene variant (see Neural tube defects below). Am I getting enough folate? Most people in the United States get enough folate. However, certain people are more likely than others to have trouble getting enough folate: Teen girls age 14–18 years, women age 19–30 years, and non-Hispanic black women People with alcohol use disorder People with disorders that lower nutrient absorption (such as celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease ) People with an MTHFR gene variant What happens if I don’t get enough folate?

Folate deficiency can also cause open sores on the tongue and inside the mouth as well as changes in the color of the skin, hair, or fingernails. Women who don't get enough folate are at risk of having babies with neural tube defects , such as spina bifida . Folate deficiency can also increase the likelihood of having a premature or low birth weight baby. What are some effects of folate on health? Scientists are studying folate to understand how it affects health. Here are several examples of what this research has shown. Neural tube defects Taking folic acid before becoming pregnant and during early pregnancy helps prevent neural tube defects in babies. Neural tube defects are major birth defects in a baby’s brain ( anencephaly ) or spine (spina bifida). However, about half of all pregnancies are unplanned. Therefore, all women and teen girls who could become pregnant should consume 400 mcg of folic acid daily from supplements, fortified foods, or both—even if they have an MTHFR C677T gene variant—in addition to the folate they get from following a healthy eating pattern. Since 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required food companies to add folic acid to enriched bread, flour, cornmeal, pasta, rice, and other grain products sold in the United States. In 2016, FDA allowed manufacturers to voluntarily add folic acid to corn masa flour. Because most people in the United States eat these foods, folic acid intakes have increased since 1998, and the number of babies born with neural tube defects has decreased. Cancer Folate that is naturally present in food may decrease the risk of several forms of cancer, but folate supplements might have different effects on cancer risk depending on how much the person takes and when.",natural_remedy

For this reason, people should be cautious about taking high doses of folic acid supplements (more than the upper limit of 1,000 mcg), especially if they have a history of colorectal adenomas (which sometimes turn into cancer). More research is needed to understand the roles of dietary folate and folic acid supplements in cancer risk. Depression People with low blood levels of folate might be more likely to have depression. In addition, they might not respond as well to antidepressant treatment as people with normal folate levels. Folate supplements, particularly those that contain 5-MTHF, might make antidepressant medications more effective. However, whether supplements help both people with normal folate levels and those with folate deficiency isn’t clear. More research is needed to better understand the role of folate in depression and whether folate supplements are helpful when used in combination with standard treatment . Heart disease and stroke Folic acid supplements lower levels of homocysteine , an amino acid in the blood that’s linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease , but the supplements don’t directly decrease the risk of heart disease. Some studies have shown that a combination of folic acid with other B-vitamins, however, helps prevent stroke . Dementia, cognitive function, and Alzheimer's disease Folic acid supplements, with or without other B-vitamins, do not seem to improve cognitive function or prevent dementia or Alzheimer’s disease .

Autism spectrum disorder Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects communication and behavior, usually beginning by age 2. People with ASD have limited interests, repetitive behaviors, and difficulty communicating and interacting with others. Some studies have shown that taking recommended amounts of folic acid before and during early pregnancy may help reduce the risk of ASD in the child. However, because the study results are inconclusive, more research is needed to understand the potential role of folic acid in lowering the risk of ASD. Can folate be harmful? Folate that is naturally present in food and beverages is not harmful. However, you should not consume folate in supplements or fortified foods and beverages in amounts above the upper limit, unless recommended by a health care provider. Taking large amounts of folate supplements might hide a vitamin B12 deficiency because these supplements can correct the anemia that the vitamin B12 deficiency causes but not the nerve damage that the vitamin B12 deficiency also causes. The vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to permanent damage of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves . Large doses of folate supplements might also worsen the symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency. High doses of folic acid might increase the risk of colorectal cancer and possibly other cancers in some people. High doses can also lead to more folic acid in the body than it can use, but whether these increased folic acid levels are harmful is not completely clear. The daily upper limits for folate from supplements and fortified foods and beverages are listed below.

For more in-depth information, see our health professional fact sheet . What is calcium and what does it do? Calcium is a mineral your body needs to build and maintain strong bones and to carry out many important functions. Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body. Almost all calcium in the body is stored in bones and teeth, giving them structure and hardness. Your body needs calcium for muscles to move and for nerves to carry messages between your brain and every part of your body. Calcium also helps blood vessels move blood throughout your body and helps release hormones that affect many functions in your body. Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium. How much calcium do I need? The amount of calcium you need each day depends on your age and sex. Average daily recommended amounts are listed below in milligrams (mg). Life Stage Recommended Amount Birth to 6 months 200 mg Infants 7–12 months 260 mg Children 1–3 years 700 mg Children 4–8 years 1,000 mg Children 9–13 years 1,300 mg Teens 14–18 years 1,300 mg Adults 19–50 years 1,000 mg Adult men 51–70 years 1,000 mg Adult women 51–70 years 1,200 mg Adults 71 years and older 1,200 mg Pregnant and breastfeeding teens 1,300 mg Pregnant and breastfeeding women 1,000 mg What foods provide calcium? Calcium is found in many foods. You can get recommended amounts of calcium by eating a variety of foods, including the following: Milk, yogurt, and cheese are the main food sources of calcium for most people in the United States. Canned sardines and salmon with bones contain calcium. Certain vegetables such as kale, broccoli, and Chinese cabbage (bok choi) also contain calcium. Calcium is added to some beverages, including many fruit juices and milk substitutes such as soy and almond beverages, as well as some brands of tofu and ready-to-eat cereals.

However, because people eat them often, what they contribute adds up. What kinds of calcium dietary supplements are available? Calcium is found in many multivitamin/mineral supplements , in calcium supplements, and in supplements that contain calcium and other nutrients such as vitamin D. Check the Supplement Facts label to determine the amount of calcium in the supplement. The two main forms of calcium in dietary supplements are calcium carbonate and calcium citrate. Calcium carbonate is absorbed best when taken with food. Some over-the-counter antacids, such as Tums and Rolaids, also contain calcium carbonate. Calcium citrate is absorbed well on an empty stomach or a full stomach. People with low levels of stomach acid—a condition most common in older people—absorb calcium citrate more easily than calcium carbonate. Other forms of calcium in supplements and fortified foods include calcium sulfate, calcium ascorbate, calcium microcrystalline hydroxyapatite, calcium gluconate, calcium lactate, and calcium phosphate. Calcium is absorbed best when you take 500 mg or less at one time. If you take 1,000 mg/day of calcium from supplements, for example, it is better to take a smaller dose twice a day than to take it all at once. Calcium supplements might cause gas, bloating, and constipation in some people. If you have any of these symptoms , try spreading out the calcium dose throughout the day, taking the supplement with meals, or switching the form of calcium you take. Am I getting enough calcium? Many people in the United States get less than recommended amounts of calcium from food and supplements, especially: Children and teens age 4 to 18 years People who are Black or Asian Adults age 50 years and older living in poverty Certain groups of people are more likely than others to have trouble getting enough calcium, including: Postmenopausal women.",supplement

Scientists are studying calcium to understand how it affects health. Here are several examples of what this research has shown. Bone health in older adults After about age 30, bones slowly lose calcium. In middle age, bone loss speeds up and can lead to weak, fragile bones (osteoporosis) and broken bones. Although bone loss is more common in women, it can affect men too. The health of your bones is measured with a bone mineral density test, which will tell whether your bones are healthy and strong or weak and thin. Some studies have found that calcium supplements with or without vitamin D increase bone mineral density in older adults, but others do not.

Fibrocystic breast disease Although not harmful, fibrocystic breast disease causes lumpy, painful breasts. It mainly affects women of reproductive age but can also occur during menopause . Very high doses of iodine supplements might reduce the pain and other symptoms of fibrocystic breast disease, but more study is necessary to confirm this. Check with your health care provider before taking iodine for this condition, especially because iodine can be unsafe at high doses. Radiation-induced thyroid cancer Nuclear accidents can release radioactive iodine into the environment, increasing the risk of thyroid cancer in people who are exposed to the radioactive iodine, especially children. People with iodine deficiency who are exposed to radioactive iodine are especially at risk of developing thyroid cancer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved potassium iodide as a thyroid-blocking agent to reduce the risk of thyroid cancer in radiation emergencies. Low iodine diets for radioactive iodine treatment Radioactive iodine treatment is used to treat some patients with thyroid cancer. Patients preparing for this treatment are usually told to follow a low iodine diet (50 mcg or less per day) for 1 to 2 weeks before treatment begins. Foods that should be avoided when following a low iodine diet include:* Iodized salt Fish and other seafood, liver, seaweed, milk and milk products, and eggs Bread that is made with iodate dough conditioners (check the ingredient listings on product labels) Maraschino cherries and some red or pink beverages because these products are often made with iodine-containing red dyes Some dietary supplements such as kelp products and many multivitamin/mineral supplements (check the Supplement Facts label to see if iodine is listed).",natural_remedy

Your body uses iron to make hemoglobin , a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body, and myoglobin, a protein that provides oxygen to muscles. Your body also needs iron to make some hormones . How much iron do I need? The amount of iron you need each day depends on your age, your sex, and whether you consume a mostly plant-based diet. Average daily recommended amounts are listed below in milligrams (mg). Vegetarians who do not eat meat, poultry , or seafood need almost twice as much iron as listed in the table because the body doesn’t absorb nonheme iron in plant foods as well as heme iron in animal foods.

What kinds of iron dietary supplements are available? Iron is available in many multivitamin/mineral supplements and in supplements that contain only iron. Iron in supplements is often in the form of ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, ferric citrate, or ferric sulfate. Dietary supplements that contain iron have a statement on the label warning that they should be kept out of the reach of children. Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Am I getting enough iron? Most people in the United States get enough iron. However, certain groups of people are more likely than others to have trouble getting enough iron: Teen girls and women with heavy periods Pregnant women and teens Infants (especially if they are premature or low-birth weight) Frequent blood donors People with cancer , gastrointestinal (GI) disorders , or heart failure What happens if I don't get enough iron? In the short term, getting too little iron does not cause obvious symptoms . The body uses its stored iron in the muscles, liver , spleen , and bone marrow . However, when levels of iron stored in the body become low, iron deficiency anemia sets in. Red blood cells become smaller and contain less hemoglobin. As a result, blood carries less oxygen from the lungs throughout the body. Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include GI upset, weakness, tiredness, lack of energy, and problems with concentration and memory. In addition, people with iron deficiency anemia are less able to fight off germs and infections , to work and exercise, and to control their body temperature. Infants and children with iron deficiency anemia might develop learning difficulties.",supplement

It can also occur in people who do not eat meat, poultry, or seafood; lose blood; have GI diseases that interfere with nutrient absorption; or eat poor diets. What are some effects of iron on health? Scientists are studying iron to understand how it affects health. Iron’s most important contribution to health is preventing iron deficiency anemia and resulting problems. Pregnant women During pregnancy, the amount of blood in a woman's body increases, so she needs more iron for herself and her growing baby. Getting too little iron during pregnancy increases a woman's risk of iron deficiency anemia and her infant's risk of low birth weight, premature birth, and low levels of iron. Getting too little iron might also harm her infant’s brain development. Women who are pregnant should talk with their health care provider and take an iron supplement if recommended. Infants and toddlers Iron deficiency anemia in infancy can lead to delayed psychological development, social withdrawal, and less ability to pay attention. By age 6 to 9 months, full-term infants could become iron deficient unless they eat iron- enriched solid foods or drink iron-fortified formula. Anemia of chronic disease Some chronic diseases —such as rheumatoid arthritis , inflammatory bowel disease , and some types of cancer—can interfere with the body's ability to use its stored iron. Taking more iron from foods or supplements usually does not reduce the resulting anemia of chronic disease because iron is diverted from the blood circulation to storage sites. The main therapy for anemia of chronic disease is treatment of the underlying disease. Can iron be harmful? Yes, iron can be harmful if you get too much.",supplement

Large amounts of iron might also cause more serious effects, including inflammation of the stomach lining and ulcers . High doses of iron can also decrease zinc absorption. Extremely high doses of iron (in the hundreds or thousands of mg) can cause organ failure, coma, convulsions, and death. Child-proof packaging and warning labels on iron supplements have greatly reduced the number of accidental iron poisonings in children. Some people have an inherited condition called hemochromatosis that causes toxic levels of iron to build up in their bodies. Without medical treatment, people with hereditary hemochromatosis can develop serious problems such as liver cirrhosis , liver cancer, and heart disease. People with this disorder should avoid using iron supplements and vitamin C supplements. The daily upper limits for iron include intakes from all sources—food, beverages, and supplements—and are listed below. A doctor might prescribe more than the upper limit of iron to people who need higher doses for a while to treat iron deficiency.

Yes, iron supplements can interact or interfere with medicines and other supplements you take. Here are several examples: Iron supplements can reduce the amount of levodopa that the body absorbs, making it less effective. Levodopa, found in Sinemet and Stalevo, is used to treat Parkinson’s disease and restless leg syndrome . Taking iron with levothyroxine can reduce this medication’s effectiveness .

Phosphorus deficiency is rare in the United States. A phosphorus deficiency can cause loss of appetite, anemia (low red blood cell counts), muscle weakness, coordination problems, bone pain, soft and deformed bones, a higher risk of infection , a feeling of burning or prickling in the skin, and confusion. What are some effects of phosphorus on health? Scientists are studying phosphorus to better understand how it affects health. Here are two examples of what this research has shown. Chronic kidney disease In severe chronic kidney disease , the kidneys stop working properly and can’t get rid of excess phosphorus. Phosphorus then builds up in the blood and can affect bone health and worsen kidney disease, and it might increase the risk of death. Consuming less phosphorus and eating more foods containing calcium might help prevent the side effects of high phosphorus levels in people with severe chronic kidney disease. Cardiovascular disease Some studies show that high blood levels of phosphorus might increase the risk of an irregular heartbeat and of death from heart disease. However, other studies haven’t found a link between phosphorus levels and heart disease risk. More research is needed to understand whether limiting the amount of phosphorus in a person’s diet has any effect on their risk of heart and blood vessel disease. Can phosphorus be harmful? High phosphorus intakes seldom cause problems in healthy people. However, you shouldn’t get more phosphorus than the upper limits from food, beverages, and dietary supplements unless your health care provider recommends doing this. The daily upper limits for phosphorus include intakes from all sources—food, beverages, and supplements—and are listed below in milligrams (mg).",natural_remedy

Yes, phosphorus can interact with medicines that you take, and some medicines can affect phosphorus levels in your body. Here are two examples: Antacids containing aluminum hydroxide or calcium carbonate can reduce the amount of phosphorus your body absorbs . Examples of these antacids are Maalox, Rulox, Rolaids, and Tums. Using these antacids for 3 months or longer can lead to low levels of phosphorus. Some laxatives , such as Fleet Prep Kit #1, contain sodium phosphate and can increase phosphorus levels. Taking more than the recommended dose of these laxatives can be dangerous, especially if you are dehydrated or have kidney disease or heart disease.

Research has not shown that any form of potassium is better than the others. Most dietary supplements provide only small amounts of potassium, no more than 99 mg per serving. Am I getting enough potassium? The diets of many people in the United States provide less than recommended amounts of potassium. Even when food and dietary supplements are combined, total potassium intakes for most people are below recommended amounts. Certain groups of people are more likely than others to have trouble getting enough potassium: People with inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis ) People who use certain medications (such as laxatives or some diuretics ) People with pica (meaning that they eat things that aren’t food, such as clay) What happens if I don't get enough potassium? Getting too little potassium can increase blood pressure, deplete calcium in bones, and increase the risk of kidney stones . Prolonged diarrhea or vomiting, laxative abuse, diuretic use, eating clay, heavy sweating, dialysis , or using certain medications can cause severe potassium deficiency . In this condition, called hypokalemia, blood levels of potassium are very low. Symptoms of hypokalemia include constipation , tiredness, muscle weakness, and not feeling well. More severe hypokalemia can cause increased urination, decreased brain function, high blood sugar levels, muscle paralysis, difficulty breathing, and irregular heartbeat.

People with low intakes of potassium have an increased risk of developing high blood pressure, especially if their diet is high in salt (sodium). Increasing the amount of potassium in your diet and decreasing the amount of sodium might help lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk of stroke. Kidney stones Getting too little potassium can deplete calcium from bones and increase the amount of calcium in urine . This calcium can form hard deposits (stones) in your kidneys, which can be very painful. Increasing the amount of potassium in your diet might reduce your risk of developing kidney stones. Bone health People who have high intakes of potassium from fruits and vegetables seem to have stronger bones. Eating more of these foods might improve your bone health by increasing bone mineral density (a measure of bone strength).

Over time, this can increase the risk of developing insulin resistance and lead to type 2 diabetes . However, more research is needed to fully understand whether potassium intakes affect blood sugar levels and the risk of type 2 diabetes. Can potassium be harmful? Potassium from food and beverages has not been shown to cause any harm in healthy people who have normal kidney function. Excess potassium is eliminated in the urine. However, people who have chronic kidney disease and those who use certain medications can develop abnormally high levels of potassium in their blood (a condition called hyperkalemia).

For more in-depth information, see our health professional fact sheet . What are omega-3 fatty acids and what do they do? Omega-3 fatty acids are found in foods, such as fish and flaxseed, and in dietary supplements , such as fish oil. The three main omega-3 fatty acids are alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). ALA is found mainly in plant oils such as flaxseed, soybean , and canola oils. DHA and EPA are found in fish and other seafood. ALA is an essential fatty acid, meaning that your body can’t make it, so you must get it from the foods and beverages you consume . Your body can convert some ALA into EPA and then to DHA, but only in very small amounts. Therefore, getting EPA and DHA from foods (and dietary supplements if you take them) is the only practical way to increase levels of these omega-3 fatty acids in your body. Omega-3s are important components of the membranes that surround each cell in your body. DHA levels are especially high in retina (eye), brain, and sperm cells. Omega-3s also provide calories to give your body energy and have many functions in your heart, blood vessels , lungs , immune system , and endocrine system (the network of hormone -producing glands ). How much omega-3s do I need? Experts have not established recommended amounts for omega-3 fatty acids, except for ALA. Average daily recommended amounts for ALA are listed below in grams (g). The amount you need depends on your age and sex.

Am I getting enough omega-3s? Most people in the United States get enough ALA from the foods they eat. They also get small amounts of EPA and DHA. Recommended amounts of EPA and DHA have not been established. What happens if I don't get enough omega-3s? A deficiency of omega-3s can cause rough, scaly skin and a red, swollen, itchy rash. Omega-3 deficiency is very rare in the United States. What are some effects of omega-3s on health? Scientists are studying omega-3s to understand how they affect health. People who eat fish and other seafood have a lower risk of several chronic diseases . However, it is not clear whether these health benefits come from simply eating these foods or from the omega-3s in these foods. Here are some examples of what the research has shown. Cardiovascular disease Many studies show that eating fatty fish and other types of seafood as part of a healthy eating pattern helps keep your heart healthy and helps protect you from some heart problems. Getting more EPA and DHA from foods or dietary supplements lowers triglyceride levels, for example.",natural_remedy

For people with heart disease, the AHA recommends consuming about 1 g per day EPA plus DHA, preferably from oily fish, but supplements are an option under the guidance of a health care provider. The AHA does not recommend omega-3 supplements for people who do not have a high risk of cardiovascular disease. Infant health and development During pregnancy and breastfeeding, eating 8 to 12 ounces per week of fish and other seafood may improve your baby’s health. However, it is important to choose fish that are higher in EPA and DHA and lower in mercury. Examples are salmon, herring, sardines, and trout. It is not clear whether taking dietary supplements containing EPA and DHA during pregnancy or breastfeeding affects a baby’s health or development. However, some studies show that taking these supplements may slightly increase a baby’s weight at birth and the length of time the baby is in the womb, both of which may be beneficial. Breast milk contains DHA. Most commercial infant formulas also contain DHA. Cancer prevention Some studies suggest that people who get more omega-3s from foods and dietary supplements may have a lower risk of breast cancer and perhaps colorectal cancer . However, a large clinical trial found that omega-3 supplements did not reduce the overall risk of cancer or the risk of breast, prostate, or colorectal cancers. Other clinical trials in progress will help clarify whether omega-3s affect cancer risk. Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, and cognitive function Some—but not all—research shows that people who consume more omega-3s from food such as fish may have a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, dementia , and other problems with cognitive function . More study of the effects of omega-3s on the brain is needed.",natural_remedy

Studies suggest that people who get higher amounts of omega-3s from the foods they eat may have a lower risk of developing AMD. However, once someone has AMD, taking omega-3 supplements does not keep the disease from getting worse or slow down vision loss. Dry eye disease Dry eye disease occurs when tears don’t provide enough moisture, causing eye discomfort and vision problems. Some studies show that getting more omega-3s from foods or supplements—mainly EPA and DHA—helps relieve symptoms of dry eye disease. However, a large, recent study found that the symptoms of people with dry eye disease who took fish oil supplements of 2,000 mg EPA plus 1,000 mg DHA daily for 1 year did not improve any more than those who took a placebo (a dummy pill). Another study in healthy people found that daily supplements of 460 mg EPA plus 380 mg DHA for 5.3 years did not affect the risk of getting dry eye disease. More research on the effects of omega-3s on dry eye disease is needed. Rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) causes chronic pain, swelling, stiffness, and loss of function in the joints. Some clinical trials have shown that taking omega-3 supplements may help manage RA when taken together with standard RA medications and other treatments. For example, people with RA who take omega-3 supplements may need less pain-relief medication, but it is not clear if the supplements reduce joint pain, swelling, or morning stiffness. Other conditions Researchers are studying whether taking omega-3 dietary supplements may help lessen some of the symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder , childhood allergies, and cystic fibrosis .

Any side effects from taking omega-3 supplements are usually mild. They include an unpleasant taste in the mouth, bad breath, heartburn, nausea , stomach discomfort, diarrhea , headache, and smelly sweat. Do omega-3s interact with medications or other dietary supplements? Omega-3 dietary supplements may interact with the medications you take. For example, high doses of omega-3s may cause bleeding problems when taken with warfarin (Coumadin) or other anticoagulant medicines. Talk with your health care provider about possible interactions between omega-3 supplements and your medications. Omega-3s and healthful eating People should get most of their nutrients from food and beverages, according to the federal government’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans . Foods contain vitamins , minerals , dietary fiber , and other components that benefit health. In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible to meet needs for one or more nutrients (for example, during specific life stages such as pregnancy).",natural_remedy

For more in-depth information, see our health professional fact sheet . What are probiotics and what do they do? Probiotics are live microorganisms (such as bacteria and yeasts) that provide health benefits when they are taken in sufficient amounts. They are present in some fermented foods, added to other foods, and available as dietary supplements . Probiotics act mainly in the digestive tract . Once in the digestive tract, probiotics may improve the function of your digestive system and other aspects of health. Probiotic microorganisms are named by their genus , species , and strain. An example of a common probiotic microorganism is Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG. In this case, Lacticaseibacillus is the genus, rhamnosus is the species, and GG is the strain. Other common probiotics include specific strains of Limosilactobacillus reuteri and Saccharomyces boulardii . What foods provide probiotics? Microorganisms are used to produce fermented foods, including yogurt, cheese, sourdough bread, pickles, apple cider vinegar, kombucha, miso, kimchi, and sauerkraut. Yogurt, for example, is made by adding live microorganisms (such as Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus ) to milk. However, while microorganisms are used to make these foods, not all these foods necessarily contain probiotics with proven health benefits. Manufacturers will sometimes add probiotics to unfermented foods, such as cereals, juices, milks, nutrition bars, smoothies, and infant and toddler formulas. If a food contains probiotics, the genus, species, and strain of the probiotic should be listed on the product label. What kinds of probiotic dietary supplements are available? Dietary supplements that are labeled as probiotics may contain different microorganisms, and the number of microorganisms they contain can vary widely between products.",natural_remedy
nih_ods_0027_2,Probiotics,NIH Office of Dietary Supplements,https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Probiotics-Consumer/,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Because some of these supplements may not have been studied, any potential health effects they have may not be known. The Supplement Facts label on a dietary supplement that contains probiotics lists the total weight of the microorganisms in the product. Many product labels also list the number of colony-forming units (CFUs) in a serving. The number of CFUs is a more accurate representation of how many active microorganisms are in a product than the total weight of the microorganisms. Examples of amounts of CFUs that you might see on a label are 1 x 10 9 (1 billion) CFUs and 1 x 10 10 (10 billion) CFUs. Higher CFU counts alone do not necessarily mean that the product has greater health benefits. A product’s health benefits, if any, are determined by both the specific microorganisms (or strains) it contains and the number of CFUs. What are some possible effects of probiotics on health? Scientists are studying probiotics to understand how they affect health. Here are some examples of what this research has shown. Atopic dermatitis Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a skin condition that mostly affects children. People with atopic dermatitis have patches of dry, itchy skin. They also experience red rashes that can come and go, and these rashes may develop sores that ooze or bleed when scratched. Some studies have shown that when pregnant women take probiotics and their infants are given probiotics after birth, the infants might have a lower risk of developing atopic dermatitis and experience less severe symptoms of dermatitis. However, the effects vary depending on the probiotic strain used and whether the mother takes it during pregnancy, the infant is given it after birth, or both. Pediatric acute infectious diarrhea Acute infectious diarrhea in infants and children causes loose or liquid stools and three or more bowel movements within 24 hours. This condition is often caused by a viral infection and can last for up to a week.",natural_remedy

Some studies have shown that certain probiotics shorten bouts of acute diarrhea by about 1 day. Other studies, however, have not shown that probiotics are effective. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea Antibiotics, such as erythromycin and penicillin, can kill beneficial microorganisms that live in the digestive tract, which sometimes results in diarrhea. Some probiotic strains might help reduce the risk of antibiotic- associated diarrhea in children and adults. This is especially true when people start taking these products within 2 days of the first antibiotic dose . Necrotizing enterocolitis Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious and sometimes deadly digestive tract illness that mostly affects preterm babies, especially those who are very small. Some probiotic strains might help reduce the risk of NEC in preterm infants. While these products are sometimes used in hospitals, additional research on their safety and effectiveness is needed because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has raised some concerns about their use in preterm infants. Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease that can affect children and adults. Types of IBD include ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. People with IBD commonly have diarrhea, stomach pain, or bloody stools that are caused by chronic inflammation in the digestive tract. Taking probiotics with medications might slightly reduce the severity of the symptoms of ulcerative colitis, but it does not seem to help people with Crohn’s disease. Irritable bowel syndrome Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder that can affect children and adults, especially women. It causes frequent stomach pain and discomfort, bloating, changes in bowel movement frequency, and diarrhea or constipation . The causes of IBS are unclear, but this condition may be a result of changes in the types of microorganisms in the digestive tract.",natural_remedy

However, the effects vary depending on the probiotic strain used, how long it is used, and the symptom being treated. Hypercholesterolemia Very high levels of cholesterol in the blood (a condition known as hypercholesterolemia) and a buildup of cholesterol in blood vessel walls can block the flow of blood to the heart and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease . This condition can affect people of all ages, but it is most common in people over 40 years of age. Some studies have shown that probiotics can slightly lower the levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, but other studies have found no benefits. More research is needed to understand the effects of probiotics on blood cholesterol. Obesity Some studies have shown that probiotics might slightly reduce body weight or body fat. Other studies have shown that probiotics have no effect or might even increase body weight. More research is needed to understand the effects of probiotics on body weight and body fat. Can probiotics be harmful? Most probiotics have been safely used in foods or dietary supplements for decades. Some of the same types of probiotics have been present in fermented food for thousands of years. In healthy people, probiotics may cause gas, but they rarely cause infections or other health problems. However, probiotics might not be safe for everyone. The FDA has reported that probiotics might cause infections or even life-threatening illness in preterm infants. Probiotics might also cause problems such as bacterial infections in people who are already seriously ill or who have weak immune systems . What should I know about choosing a probiotic?

Some products list the number of CFUs at the time of manufacture whereas others list the number through the expiration date or use-by date. It is worth noting that the number of CFUs in a probiotic can decline over time. Therefore, the number of CFUs that a product contained when it was manufactured does not necessarily reflect the number of CFUs that the product contains when it is purchased or used.

Fact Sheet for Consumers This is a general overview. For more in-depth information, see our health professional fact sheet . What is ashwagandha and what does it do? Ashwagandha is a plant used in traditional Ayurvedic and Unani medicine. It is commonly promoted for sleep, stress, and anxiety as well as cognitive function . Ashwagandha is also known as Withania somnifera , Indian ginseng, and winter cherry. Ashwagandha supplements usually contain extracts made from the plant’s roots or from the roots and leaves. Does ashwagandha work? The health effects of ashwagandha extracts have not been thoroughly studied, but here’s what we have learned from the research so far. Stress and anxiety Ashwagandha extracts might help reduce stress and anxiety. In several studies, people who took ashwagandha for 6 to 8 weeks reported that they felt less stress and anxiety as well as less fatigue and sleeplessness. Ashwagandha also lowered stress hormone levels. In some studies, ashwagandha appeared to be more effective when taken at doses of 500 to 600 milligrams (mg) per day compared with lower doses. Sleep Results from a few small studies suggest that ashwagandha extracts might improve sleep. In these studies, people who had trouble sleeping and took ashwagandha reported that they fell asleep faster, slept longer, and woke up less often during the night. Overall, the benefits for sleep were small, but ashwagandha seemed most helpful when taken at doses of 600 mg per day or more for at least 8 weeks. Is ashwagandha safe? In the studies described above, there were no safety concerns when people used ashwagandha extracts for up to about 3 months.

However, making these lifestyle changes isn’t easy, so you might wonder if taking a dietary supplement that’s promoted for weight loss might help. This fact sheet describes what’s known about the safety and effectiveness of many ingredients that are commonly used in weight-loss dietary supplements . Sellers of these supplements might claim that their products help you lose weight by blocking the absorption of fat or carbohydrates, curbing your appetite, or speeding up your metabolism . However, there’s little scientific evidence that weight-loss supplements work. Many are expensive, some can interact or interfere with medications, and a few might be harmful. If you’re thinking about taking a dietary supplement to lose weight, talk with your health care provider. This is especially important if you have high blood pressure , diabetes , heart disease, liver disease, or other medical conditions. What are the ingredients in weight-loss dietary supplements?

Caffeine Caffeine Caffeine is a stimulant that can make you more alert, give you a boost of energy, burn calories, and increase fat breakdown. Often added to weight-loss dietary supplements, caffeine is found naturally in tea, guarana, kola (cola) nut, yerba mate, and other herbs. The labels of supplements that contain caffeine don't always list it, so you might not know if a supplement has caffeine. Does it work? Weight-loss dietary supplements with caffeine might help you lose a little weight or gain less weight over time. When you use caffeine regularly, however, you become tolerant of it. This tolerance might lessen any effect of caffeine on body weight over time. Is it safe? Caffeine is safe for most adults at doses up to 400‒500 milligrams (mg) a day, but it can make you feel nervous, jittery, and shaky. It can also affect your sleep. At higher doses, it can cause nausea, vomiting, rapid heartbeat, and seizures. Combining caffeine with other stimulant ingredients can increase caffeine's effects. Calcium Calcium Calcium is a mineral you need for healthy bones, muscles, nerves, blood vessels, and many of your body's functions. It's claimed to burn fat and decrease fat absorption. Does it work? Calcium—either from food or in weight-loss dietary supplements—probably doesn't help you lose weight or prevent weight gain. Is it safe? Calcium is safe at the recommended amounts of 1,000 to 1,200 mg a day for adults.

Vitamin D Vitamin D Your body needs vitamin D for good health and strong bones. People who are obese tend to have lower levels of vitamin D, but there is no known reason why taking vitamin D would help people lose weight. Does it work? Vitamin D doesn't help you lose weight. Is it safe? Vitamin D from foods and dietary supplements is safe at the recommended amounts of 15‒20 mcg (600‒800 International Units [IU]) a day for adults. Too much vitamin D (more than 100 mcg [4,000 IU] a day) can be toxic and cause nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and irregular heartbeat.

FDA is the federal agency that oversees dietary supplements in the United States. Unlike over-the-counter and prescription drugs —which must be approved by FDA before they can be sold—dietary supplements don’t require review or approval by FDA before they are put on the market. Also, manufacturers don’t have to provide evidence to FDA that their products are safe or effective before selling these products. When FDA finds an unsafe dietary supplement, it can remove the supplement from the market or ask the supplement maker to recall it.

For more in-depth information, see our health professional fact sheet . What are dietary supplements for exercise and athletic performance and what do they do? If you get regular exercise—and especially if you're an athlete and compete in sporting events—you know that a nutritionally adequate diet and plenty of fluids are important for maximizing your physical performance. You may wonder, however, if dietary supplements could help you train harder, improve performance, or gain a competitive edge. This fact sheet describes what's known about the effectiveness and safety of many ingredients in dietary supplements that are promoted to improve exercise and athletic performance. These products are sometimes called ergogenic aids, but this fact sheet simply refers to them as performance supplements. Sellers of these supplements might claim that their products improve strength or endurance, help you achieve a performance goal more quickly, or increase your tolerance for more intense training. They might also claim that their supplements can help prepare your body for exercise, reduce the chance of injury during training, or assist with recovery after exercise. Performance supplements cannot substitute for a healthy diet, but some of them may have value, depending on the type and intensity of your activity. Other supplements don't seem to work, and a few might be harmful. If you're thinking about taking a performance supplement, talk to your health care provider. If you have a trainer or coach with knowledge of sports medicine, ask them about performance supplements. Talking to an expert is important if you're a teenager or have any medical conditions. It's also important to find out whether medications you take might interact with the performance supplements you're considering.

These products are sold in various forms, such as capsules , tablets, liquids, and powders. This fact sheet describes ingredients in performance supplements below in alphabetical order. You'll learn whether each ingredient is effective and safe and get expert advice about using it. Keep in mind, however, that many performance supplements in the marketplace contain more than one ingredient, and ingredients can work differently when they're combined. Because most ingredient combinations have not been studied, we don't know how effective or safe they are in improving performance. You may be surprised to learn that makers of performance supplements usually don't carry out studies in people to find out whether their products really work and are safe. When studies on performance supplement ingredients and ingredient combinations are done (mainly by researchers at colleges and universities), they often involve small numbers of people taking the supplement for just a few days, weeks, or months. Much of the research is done in young healthy men, but not women, middle-aged and older adults, or teenagers. And often, studies haven't looked at the use of supplement ingredients or combinations in people involved in the same athletic activity as you. For example, the results from a study in weightlifters might not apply to you if you are a distance runner. Ingredients in supplements for exercise and athletic performance INGREDIENT DOES IT WORK? IS IT SAFE? BOTTOM LINE Antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, and coenzyme Q10) Antioxidants (vitamin C, vitamin E, and coenzyme Q10) You breathe in more oxygen when you exercise. As a result, free radicals form and damage muscle cells.",natural_remedy
nih_ods_0049_3,Dietary Supplements for Exercise and Athletic Performance,NIH Office of Dietary Supplements,https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/ExerciseAndAthleticPerformance-Consumer/,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Because antioxidants can reduce free-radical damage to muscle, some people think that taking them in a supplement might reduce muscle inflammation, soreness, and fatigue. Does it work? No. The free radicals that form when you exercise seem to help muscle fibers grow and produce more energy. Antioxidant supplements might actually reduce some of the benefits of exercise, including muscle growth and power output. Also, they have little effect on aerobic fitness and performance in endurance activities like distance running. Is it safe? Everyone needs adequate amounts of vitamin C and vitamin E for good health. Getting too much of these nutrients can be harmful, but the amounts of vitamin C (about 1,000 milligrams) and vitamin E (about 500 International Units [IU]) typically used in studies of performance supplements are below safe upper limits. The side effects from coenzyme Q10 can include tiredness, insomnia, headaches, and some gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort, but these effects tend to be mild. Bottom Line There’s little scientific evidence to support taking supplements containing vitamins C and E or coenzyme Q10 to improve performance if you’re getting adequate amounts of these nutrients from a nutritious diet. Bottom Line : There’s little scientific evidence to support taking supplements containing vitamins C and E or coenzyme Q10 to improve performance if you’re getting adequate amounts of these nutrients from a nutritious diet. Arginine Arginine Arginine is an amino acid in foods that contain protein, like meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, and legumes. A nutritious diet supplies about 4 to 5 grams a day. Supplement sellers claim that taking larger amounts of arginine in supplements improves performance, partly because the body converts it into nitric oxide, which expands blood vessels and increases blood flow.",natural_remedy

Although the research is limited, arginine supplements seem to have little to no effect on strengthening and muscle-building exercises (like bodybuilding) or aerobic activities (like running and cycling). Studies have used 2 to 20 grams a day of arginine for up to 3 months. Is it safe? Arginine supplements seem safe when users take up to 9 grams a day for several days or weeks. Taking more can cause GI discomfort and can slightly lower blood pressure.

Bottom Line : There’s little scientific evidence to support taking arginine supplements to increase strength, improve performance, or help tired and sore muscles recover after exercise. Beetroot or beet juice Beetroot or beet juice Beets and beet juice are among the best food sources of nitrate. Beet juice might improve athletic performance because the body converts some of this nitrate to nitric oxide, which expands blood vessels. This blood vessel expansion increases blood flow and the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to exercising muscle. The expanded blood vessels also speed up the removal of waste products that cause muscle fatigue. Does it work? Many, but not all, studies have found that beet juice can improve performance and endurance in aerobic activities like running, swimming, cycling, and rowing, but whether it helps with strengthening and bodybuilding exercises isn’t known.

Beta-alanine Beta-alanine Beta-alanine is an amino acid in foods such as meat, poultry, and fish. People get up to about 1 gram a day of beta-alanine, depending on their diet. Your body uses beta-alanine to make carnosine in skeletal muscles. When you exercise intensely for several minutes, your muscles produce lactic acid, which reduces muscular force and causes tiredness. Carnosine reduces the buildup of lactic acid. Beta-alanine supplements increase muscle carnosine levels by different amounts, depending on the person. Does it work? Some, but not all, studies have shown that beta-alanine produces small performance improvements in swimming and team sports, like hockey and football, that require high-intensity, intermittent effort over short periods. Whether beta-alanine helps with endurance activities like cycling isn’t clear. It’s also not clear whether beta-alanine mainly benefits trained athletes or recreational exercisers. In most studies, participants took 1.6 to 6.4 grams a day of beta-alanine for 4 to 8 weeks. Is it safe? Taking 800 milligrams or more beta-alanine can cause moderate to severe paresthesia, a tingling, prickling, or burning sensation in your face, neck, back of the hands, and upper trunk. This effect can last 60 to 90 minutes but is not considered serious or harmful.

Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) Your body converts a small amount of leucine, one of the amino acids in foods and protein powders, to HMB. Your liver then converts the HMB into another compound that experts think helps muscle cells restore their structure and function after exercise. HMB also helps build protein in muscle and reduces muscle-protein breakdown. Does it work? It’s hard to know whether you might benefit from using HMB supplements because the research on these supplements has included adults of very different ages and fitness levels who took widely varying doses for different amounts of time. Overall, HMB seems to speed up recovery from exercise that’s intense enough and long enough to cause muscle damage. Therefore, if you’re a trained athlete, you’ll need to exert yourself more than recreationally active people to cause the muscle damage that HMB might help treat. Is it safe?

Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) The amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine are known as BCAAs. Animal foods, like meat, fish, and milk, contain BCAAs. Your muscles can use these three amino acids to provide energy during exercise. Leucine might also help build muscle. Does it work? There’s little evidence that BCAA supplements improve performance in endurance activities like distance running. BCAA supplements might help increase your muscle size and strength together with a weight-training program, but it isn’t clear whether taking BCAA supplements will help you build more muscle than just eating enough high-quality protein foods. Is it safe? A nutritious diet with enough protein can easily provide 10 to 20 grams a day of the BCAAs. Taking up to another 20 grams a day of BCAAs in supplements seems to be safe.

It improves your body’s response to athletic training and helps shorten the time you need to recover after exercise. Protein is made from amino acids. Your body makes some amino acids but needs to get others (known as essential amino acids [EAAs]) from food. Animal foods like meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products contain all of the EAAs. Plant foods like grains and legumes contain different EAAs, so eating a diet containing different types of plant-based foods is one way to get all EAAs. Most protein powders and drinks contain whey, a protein in milk that provides all the EAAs. Does it work? Adequate protein in your diet provides the EAAs necessary for making muscle proteins and reduces the breakdown of proteins in your muscles. Athletes need about 0.5 to 0.9 grams of protein per pound of body weight a day (or about 75 to 135 grams for a person weighing 150 pounds).

This page has resources to help answer your questions about flu vaccines. Prevention steps and strategies Take time to get a flu vaccine. Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine every season, especially people at higher risk . CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccine as the first and most important action in reducing your risk of flu and its potentially serious outcomes. For 2025-2026 flu season , CDC recommends seasonal flu vaccination for children, pregnant women, and adults with only single-dose formulations of flu vaccine that are free of thimerosal as a preservative. Flu vaccines help to reduce the burden of flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths on the health care system each year. (Read more about flu vaccine benefits .) Flu vaccination also has been shown to reduce the severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick. All flu vaccines are designed to protect against three influenza viruses (Visit Vaccine Virus Selection for this season's vaccine composition.) Everyone 6 months and older should get an annual flu vaccine, ideally by the end of October but people should continue to get vaccinated as long as flu viruses pose a threat to their community. Vaccination of people at higher risk of developing serious flu complications is especially important to decrease their risk of severe flu illness. People at higher risk of serious flu complications include young children , pregnant women , people with certain chronic health conditions like asthma , diabetes or heart and lung disease, and people 65 years and older . Vaccination also is important for health care workers and other people who live with or care for people at higher risk of serious flu illness to keep from spreading flu to them.",prevention
cdc_0001_2, ,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevention/index.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"This is especially true for people who work in long-term care facilities, which are home to many of the people most vulnerable to flu. Children younger than 6 months are at higher risk of serious flu illness but are too young to be vaccinated. People who care for infants should be vaccinated instead. Health care providers can support patients in making informed decisions about vaccinations. Take everyday preventive actions to stop the spread of germs. Take actions every day to help stop the spread of germs. Getting a flu vaccine is the most important. Take other preventive actions in addition to vaccination that may help reduce the spread of viruses like flu. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. If you are sick, limit contact with others as much as possible to keep from infecting them. For flu , CDC recommends that people stay home, for at least 24 hours, until both are true: your symptoms are getting better overall, and you have not had fever (and are not using fever-reducing medication). About Preventing Spread of Respiratory Viruses When You're Sick | What To Do If You Get Sick . After these two criteria are met, there are some additional precautions that can be taken to protect others from respiratory illness. These include taking steps for cleaner air and hygiene practices like cleaning frequently touched surfaces. More information is available about core and additional prevention strategies. Cover coughs and sneezes. Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it. Wearing a mask is an additional prevention strategy that you can choose to further protect yourself and others. When worn by a person with an infection, masks reduce the spread of the virus to others. Masks can also protect wearers from breathing in infectious particles from people around them. Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.",prevention

You can improve air quality by bringing in fresh outside air, purifying indoor air, or gathering outdoors. Cleaner air can reduce the risk of exposure to viruses. Treatment Take flu antiviral drugs if your doctor prescribes them. If you are sick with flu, antiviral drugs can be used to treat your illness. Antiviral drugs are different from antibiotics. They are prescription medicines (pills, liquid or an inhaled powder) and are not available over-the-counter. Flu antiviral drugs can make flu illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They may also prevent serious flu complications . For people at higher risk of serious flu illness , treatment with an antiviral drug can mean the difference between having a milder illness and having a very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay. Studies show that flu antiviral drugs work best for treatment when they are started within 2 days of getting sick, but starting them later can still be helpful, especially if the sick person is at higher risk of severe flu illness or is very sick from flu. If you are at higher risk of severe flu illness and get flu symptoms, call your health care provider early so you can be treated with flu antivirals if needed. Follow your doctor's instructions for taking this drug. Flu symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Some people also may have vomiting and diarrhea. People may be infected with influenza virus and have respiratory symptoms without a fever.

A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Anyone who eats undercooked or raw fish or squid is at risk. You can prevent getting anisakiasis by not eating raw or undercooked fish or squid. Overview Anisakiasis (also known as herring worm disease) is a parasitic disease caused by nematodes (worms) that attach to the walls of the esophagus, stomach, or intestine. Anisakiasis is most commonly found in areas where eating raw fish is popular, such as Japan. Because eating undercooked fish is becoming more common, there have been cases in the US, Europe, South America, and other areas of the world. Signs and symptoms People with anisakiasis can experience signs and symptoms such as Abdominal pain Nausea Vomiting Abdominal distention (abnormal abdominal expansion) Diarrhea Blood and mucus in stool Mild fever People can also experience allergic reactions such as Rashes Itching Infrequently anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction) Some people experience a tingling sensation during or after eating raw or undercooked fish or squid. This sensation is actually the worm moving in the mouth or throat. People can often take the worm out of their mouth themselves or cough it up to prevent infection. Some people experience vomiting, which can often expel the worm from the body. How it spreads When certain infected marine mammals (e.g., whales or sea lions) defecate (poop) in the sea, they release eggs. These eggs become infective larvae while in the water. Crustaceans (e.g., crabs, lobsters, shrimps) consume the infective larvae, and then fish or squid consume the crustaceans. When humans eat raw or undercooked infected fish or squid, they consume the nematode larvae, which can invade the gastrointestinal tract. Eventually, the parasite dies and produces an inflamed mass in the esophagus, stomach, or intestine.",condition

Symptoms can include diarrhea and abdominal pain. You can get balantidiasis by consuming food or water contaminated with infective feces. Overview Balantidium coli is an intestinal protozoan parasite that causes the infection called balantidiasis. While this type of infection is uncommon in the United States, humans and other mammals can become infected with Balantidium coli by ingesting infective cysts from food and water that is contaminated by feces. Mostly asymptomatic, Balantidium infection can cause such symptoms as diarrhea and abdominal pain. Balantidium coli infection in humans is rare in the United States. Balantidium coli is found throughout the world, but it is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions and developing countries. Because pigs are an animal reservoir, human infections occur more frequently in areas where pigs are raised, especially if good hygiene is not practiced. Signs and symptoms Most people infected with Balantidium coli experience no symptoms. Balantidium coli infects the large intestine in humans and produces infective microscopic cysts that are passed in the feces, potentially leading to re-infection or infection of others. People compromised immune systems are the most likely to experience more severe signs and symptoms. These include persistent diarrhea, dysentery, abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, and vomiting. If left untreated, perforation of the colon can occur. How it spreads Balantidium coli is transmitted through the fecal-oral route. Humans can become infected by eating and drinking contaminated food and water that has come into contact with infective animal or human fecal matter.",condition

There is no evidence that ticks spread Bartonella infection to people. Cat scratch disease is the most common form of bartonellosis in the United States. Overview Several species of Bartonella bacteria cause disease in people. Infection with any one of these bacteria is referred to broadly as bartonellosis, although some forms of infection also have common names (for example, cat scratch disease). For more information: Bartonella henselae infection (cat scratch disease) Bartonella quintana infection Bartonella bacilliformis infection B. henselae is transmitted by the scratch of domestic or feral cats. Cats can have fleas that carry the bacteria. B. quintana is transmitted by the human body louse. B. bacilliformis is transmitted by bites from infected sand flies. There is no evidence that Bartonella species can be transmitted to people by ticks. Transmission studies with ticks have only used mice and artificial feeding systems which do not demonstrate that a tick can spread bacteria to people or that the bacteria can survive in a tick for any length of time.

Overview Blastocystis is a microscopic parasite found throughout the world. A parasite is an organism (living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. A full understanding of Blastocystis and whether it causes disease in humans is unclear. There are prescription drugs available to treat blastocystosis in people with symptoms. Signs and symptoms Many people with blastocystosis have no symptoms. However, some people who have Blastocystis in their stool (poop) have some of the following symptoms: Watery or loose stools Diarrhea Abdominal pain Anal itching Weight loss Constipation Excess gas In some studies, blastocystosis has also been associated with various skin rashes and hives. How it spreads It is unclear how Blastocystis spreads. However, the number of people infected appears to increase in areas that use unimproved sanitation facilities (when there is no sanitary separation of human waste from human contact). Studies have suggested that risk of infection may increase through: Consuming contaminated food or water. Working at or attending a daycare or childcare facility. Close contact with a wide range of animals. There is little risk of spreading the infection if you practice good personal hygiene, as outlined in the prevention steps.

A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Medication is available to treat capillariasis. Without treatment, the infection can be deadly. Overview Capillariasis is a parasitic infection in humans caused by two species of nematodes (roundworms): Capillaria hepatica (C. hepatica) This infection can lead to hepatitis (liver disease). C. hepatica is rare disease in humans (usually affects rodents and other wild animals). Despite this, there have been human cases reported on all continents except Australia. Capillaria philippinesis (C. philippinesis) This infection can lead to diarrhea and emaciation. C. philippinesis is frequently found in the Philippines (especially the Luzon region) and Thailand. There are occasionally cases reported from other East and Southeast Asian countries. Rarely cases have been reported in Egypt, the Middle East, and Colombia. Signs and symptoms C. hepatica People infected with a single C. hepatica worm or a few worms often have no signs or symptoms. Female worms lay eggs continuously and when infections with multiple worms occur, symptoms can be severe, and may include Hepatitis Anemia Fever Hypereosinophilia Death C. philippinensis When people are first infected with C. philippinensis, they can have the following signs and symptoms: General abdominal pain Diarrhea If the diseases are not treated, later on, people can develop severe disease and experience the following signs and symptoms: Nausea Vomiting Weight loss Death How it spreads C. hepatica C. hepatica can be found in the livers of small rodents, monkeys, and prairie dogs, where it can cause cirrhosis (scarring of the liver). When large carnivores eat these animals, they consume the capillarid eggs, which then pass through their stool (poop).",condition
cdc_0015_2,Capillaria Infection,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/capillaria,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"When the carnivore poops in soil, the eggs become infective in about 30 days, which can then infect other animals and humans. Alternatively, when the infected rodents, monkeys, or prairie dogs die naturally and decompose, eggs from their livers are released into the soil. If humans consume the eggs from the environment, either directly by eating soil (pica) or indirectly through contaminated food or water, the eggs move to the liver and mature to adult worms. C. hepatica can be transmitted human-to-human when eggs are deposited through human feces (poop) into the soil. C. philippinensis C. philippinensis is often found in small, freshwater fish. When humans consume raw or undercooked infected fish, larvae move to the intestine and mature to adult worms. Female worms deposit eggs in the intestine, which are then released through feces. When infected human feces reach freshwater, fish can get infected and the cycle continues. In some cases eggs may hatch within the human intestine, causing hyperinfection (a massive number of adult worms). C. philippinensis is not transmitted from infected humans to other humans; transmission requires the intermediate freshwater fish host. However, adult C. philippinensis worms that grow within the intestine of infected humans can release eggs that hatch into larvae; this could cause hyperinfection in that human host. Left untreated, this can lead to severe disease. Prevention You can take steps to prevent both types of capillariasis: Sanitation and hygiene precautions Use sanitation facilities (toilets and latrines) that are out of reach from animals and will not let feces seep into the water or around food supplies. Wash your hands with soap and warm water after touching or working with soil and before handling food. Teach children the importance of handwashing.

Keep Reading Preventing Cronobacter in Infants Quick facts Fact Until 2024, invasive Cronobacter infection was not on the list of nationally notifiable conditions, and Minnesota and Michigan were the only states that required reporting. Because most states did not require reporting before 2024, rates of Cronobacter infection in the United States are not well understood, and the true number of annual cases is unknown. Listing Cronobacter as a nationally notifiable condition will help us learn more about the true number of cases that occur each year. Evidence 1 suggests Cronobacter infections are most common in infants less than 2 months old and often cause death in this age group. Also, infections among older adults may be more common, although milder, than infections among infants. While cases in older children and adults do occur, these cases are not nationally notifiable, and therefore are not currently collected in routine surveillance. Around 20% of infants with meningitis or bloodstream infections due to Cronobacter in the United States have died 2 . Worldwide, approximately 40% of infants reported to have Cronobacter meningitis or bloodstream infections have died 2 . Typically, CDC receives 2-4 reports of severe Cronobacter infections in infants annually from health departments and has received reports from 32 states. From January 2002 to July 2022, CDC received 76 reports of severe Cronobacter illnesses among infants.

Many people carrying the parasite have no symptoms, but gut-related symptoms have been associated with this parasite in some people. Infection is common in the United States and globally. Resource‎ Healthcare providers can find more information on the Clinical Care of Dientamoeba fragilis page. Signs and symptoms Many people have no symptoms. If symptoms are present, the most common are diarrhea and/or abdominal pain. Other symptoms can include loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Causes It is unclear how D. fragilis spreads. Most likely, people get infected by accidentally swallowing the parasite; this is called fecal-oral transmission. This could be through contaminated food or water, person-to-person, or animal fecal (poop) contact. The D. fragilis parasite is fragile and cannot live very long in the environment (after it passes in feces) or in stomach acid (after it is swallowed). Prevention To prevent infection with D. fragilis , Wash your hands with soap and water after using the toilet, after changing diapers, and before preparing or eating food. Teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection. Diagnosis Your healthcare provider can take a stool (poop) sample and examine it for D. fragilis infection.",condition

Overview Dibothriocephalus latu s, and related species (belonging to the family Diphyllobothriidae, also called fish or broad tapeworms), are the largest tapeworms to infect people. They can grow to up to 30 feet long. Most people infected with fish tapeworms have no symptoms. However, complications can include intestinal obstruction (blockages in the intestines) and gall bladder disease. This happens when the segments of the tapeworm (called proglottids) move or migrate in the body. Several different Diphyllobothriid species infect humans.

A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. The disease affects communities in remote parts of Africa that do not have safe water to drink. There is no treatment nor a vaccine for Guinea worm disease. Overview Dracunculiasis, also known as Guinea worm disease (GWD), is an infection caused by the parasite Dracunculus medinensis. GWD is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) transmitted to people mostly by consuming unsafe water. Unfiltered drinking water from ponds or other stagnant surface water sources can contain near-microscopic crustaceans called copepods (tiny ""water fleas"") that are infected with Guinea worm larvae (immature forms of the Guinea worm). Signs and symptoms People do not usually have GWD symptoms until about one year after infection. Then, a mature pregnant female worm full of larvae creates a blister on the skin through which she will emerge and expel her larvae when she comes in contact with water. A few days to hours before the worm, which can measure up to 3 feet (1 meter) in length, comes out of the skin, a person may develop fever, swelling, and pain in the area. Most worms come out of people's legs and feet, though worms can come out of other body parts, too. Challenges People in remote rural communities who have GWD often lack access to healthcare. When the adult female worm comes out of the skin, it can be very painful, disabling, and take a long time to remove. The emerging worm can cause a wound that may develop a secondary infection. People at risk Anyone who consumes drinking water from a pond or other stagnant water source contaminated with infected copepods is at risk for infection. People's risk for disease can vary. People do not get immunity after GWD, which means they can get it again. GWD transmission also has a seasonal pattern.",condition
cdc_0024_2,Dracunculus medinensis Infection,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/guinea-worm/about/,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"How it spreads Water contact triggers the Guinea worm to release a milky white liquid that contains hundreds of thousands of immature larvae into the water. In ponds and other stagnant water sources, these larvae are then consumed by copepods. People might become infected with Guinea worms by consuming unfiltered drinking water from such water sources containing infected copepods. People and animals might also become infected by eating certain aquatic animals (e.g., fish or frogs) that have swallowed infected copepods. People and animals infected with GWD can then spread the disease when the worm matures and is ready to emerge from the body if they enter ponds and other stagnant water sources that others drink from. Prevention Guinea worm is a disease that has been prioritized for eradication by the World Health Organization. There were an estimated 3.5 million Guinea worm cases occurring annually in 20 African and Asian countries in 1986, but today, through the Guinea Worm Eradication Program (GWEP), only a handful of countries continue to have the disease. GWEP undertakes several water-related and other measures to prevent GWD: Surveillance and case containment Safe water practices, including distribution of cloth and pipe filters to remove copepods, and advocacy for installation or rehabilitation of safe drinking water supplies like borehole wells Vector control Health education and community mobilization Quick facts There were 14 human GWD cases reported in 2023 in Chad, South Sudan, Mali, Cameroon, and Central African Republic. There were 714 animal GWD infections reported in 2023, which is a slight increase compared to 2022 following expanded surveillance activities. WHO has certified 200 countries free from Guinea worm.

High Lp(a) levels run in families. Current treatments for high Lp(a) are limited. What it is High levels of lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a), pronounced “L-P-little-A”) increase your likelihood of having a heart attack, a stroke, and aortic stenosis, especially if you have familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or signs of coronary heart disease. Cholesterol travels through the blood on lipoproteins, which are made of protein and fat. Lipoproteins include low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and Lp(a). Effects High Lp(a) levels increase your likelihood of having a heart attack or stroke, especially if you have FH or signs of coronary heart disease. This is because: Like LDL-cholesterol, Lp(a)-cholesterol can build up in the walls of your blood vessels. This is more likely this is to happen if you have higher Lp(a) levels. These cholesterol deposits, called plaques, can decrease blood flow to your heart, brain, kidneys, lungs, legs, and other parts of your body. Plaques can grow over time or suddenly rupture, blocking blood vessels and leading to heart attacks or strokes. 1 Lp(a) can cause increased clotting, which can lead to rapidly formed blockages in blood vessels. 1 Lp(a) promotes inflammation which increases the likelihood that plaques will rupture. Because of its role in inflammation, high Lp(a) can also lead to narrowing of the aortic valve, called aortic stenosis. 1 Chronic inflammation leads to calcium build up on the valve, causing stiffness. This can result in reduced blood flow if the valve is unable to open completely. In some cases, people with aortic stenosis need surgery or a procedure to replace the aortic valve.

Lp(a) is not routinely included when you get your cholesterol checked. Your healthcare provider has to order the blood test for Lp(a) separately. About a third of people with FH also have high Lp(a) levels, and current recommendations state that people with FH should have their Lp(a) level checked. Treatment Lp(a) levels cannot be controlled by healthy eating and exercising. Lipoprotein apheresis is the only therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating high Lp(a) levels, and it is only approved for people with FH who have LDL≥100 mg/dL, Lp(a)≥60 mg/dL, and coronary or other artery disease.",condition

The taxonomic position of this group has been debated and revised repeatedly; historically, they were considered protozoa and often remain managed by diagnostic parasitology laboratories. Microsporidia are characterized by the production of resistant spores that vary in size (usually 1—4 µm for medically-important species). They possess a unique organelle, the polar tubule or polar filament, which is coiled inside the spore as demonstrated by its ultrastructure. Microsporidia also possess degenerated mitochondria called mitosomes and lack a conventional Golgi apparatus. To date, more than 1400 species belonging to over 200 genera have been described as parasites infecting a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. There are at least 15 microsporidian species that have been identified as human pathogens; the vast majority of cases being caused by Enterocytozoon bieneusi, followed by some Encephalitozoon species ( E. cuniculi, E. hellem , E. intestinalis ( =Septata intestinalis )). Other less frequently reported agents include members of the genera Anncaliia (= Brachiola ) ( A. algerae , A. connori, A. vesicularum ), Microsporidium ( M . ceylonensis , M. africanum ), Trachipleistophora ( T. hominis, T. anthropophthera ), Nosema ocularum , Pleistophora ronneafiei , Vittaforma corneae (= Nosema corneae ), Tubulinosema acridophagus , and an unknown species likely belonging to Endoreticulatus .",condition
cdc_0032_2,Microsporidia Infection,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/microsporidiosis/index.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Life Cycle View Larger The infective form of microsporidia is the resistant spore, which can persist in the environment for months The spore then germinates, rapidly everting its polar tubule which contacts the eukaryotic host cell membrane . The spore then injects the infective sporoplasm into the host cell through the polar tubule . Inside the cell, the sporoplasm enters the proliferative phase marked by extensive multiplication via merogony (binary fission or multiple fission), creating meronts . The location of this developmental stage within the host cell varies by genus; it can occur either in direct contact with the host cell cytosol ( Enterocytozoon, Nosema ), inside a parasitophorous vacuole of unknown origin ( Encephalitozoon ), in a parasite-secreted envelope ( Pleistophora, Trachipleistophora ), or surrounded by the host cell endoplasmic reticulum ( Endoreticulatus, Vittaforma ) . Following the proliferative phase, meronts undergo sporogony in which the thick spore wall and invasion apparatus develop, creating sporonts and eventually mature spores when all organelles are polarized. When the spores increase in number and completely fill the host cell cytoplasm, the cell membrane is disrupted and spores are released to the surroundings . These free mature spores can infect new cells thus continuing the cycle. Mature spores of intestinal-localizing species may be shed in feces, although the route of transmission remains uncertain for many species. Exposure to spores in water or in soil appears to be a potentially major route, based on the finding of spores in these sources along with case histories. E. bieneusi and V. corneae have been identified in surface waters, and spores of Nosema sp. (and likely A. algerae ) have been identified in ditch water.

Enterocytozoon bieneusi is generally considered a human parasite, but has been detected in swine, primates, cattle, cats, dogs, and several other mammals. Some, but not all, of these animal-derived strains appear to represent zoonotic genotypes. Encephalitozoon cuniculi is endemic in several captive and wild rabbit populations. It has also occasionally been found in domestic dogs, cats, foxes, captive monkeys, and mink. Birds, especially psittacines (parrots, parakeets, love birds, budgerigars, etc.), may represent reservoirs for Encephalitozoon hellem . Unlike the other two important members of the genus, E. intestinalis is only rarely identified in animals other than humans. The host range of the other microsporidia known to infect humans is not as well known. No animal reservoir has been identified for Vittaforma cornea.

Historically it has been observed in severely immunocompromised persons, particularly among persons with AIDS, however the implementation of effective anti-retroviral therapies has reduced the incidence in this group considerably. Cases are also known to occur in immunocompetent individuals.",condition

The most widely used staining technique is the Chromotrope 2R method or its modifications. This technique stains the spore and the spore wall a bright pinkish red. Often, a darker-staining equatorial band is seen in the middle of the spore. This technique, however, is lengthy and time consuming and requires about 90 min.",condition

The spores stain dark violet and the equatorial band is enhanced. In some cases dark staining Gram positive granules are also clearly seen. Chemofluorescent agents such as Calcofluor white are also useful in the quick identification of spores in fecal smears. The spores measure from 0.8 to 1.4 µm in the case of Enterocytozoon bieneusi , and 1.5 to 4 µm in Anncaliia algerae , Encephalitozoon spp., Vittaforma corneae , and Nosema spp. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is still the gold standard and is necessary for the identification of the microsporidian species, which is based on internal features of the spore such as the number of polar tubule coils. However, TEM is expensive, time consuming, and not feasible for routine diagnosis. Immunofluorescence Assays (IFA) IFAs are available for microsporidia using monoclonal and/or polyclonal antibodies. Molecular Methods (PCR) The CDC offers molecular identification of Enterocytozoon bieneusi , Encephalitozoon intestinalis , Encephalitozoon hellem and Encephalitozoon cuniculi using species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Molecular identification of other microsporidia species can be attempted using genera-specific primers and sequencing analysis on a case-by-case basis.

It is often called the ""brain-eating ameba"" because it can infect the brain and destroy brain tissue. Brain infections caused by Naegleria fowleri are very rare but nearly always fatal. Overview Naegleria fowleri lives in soil and warm freshwater lakes, rivers, ponds, and hot springs around the world. In very rare cases, Naegleria fowleri has been found in poorly maintained swimming pools, splash pads, and other recreational venues. The ameba also has been found in tap water. If water containing the ameba goes up the nose and to the brain, it can cause an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Typically, fewer than 10 people a year in the United States get PAM. Nearly everyone who gets PAM dies from it. Between 1962 and 2024, there were 167 reported cases of PAM in the United States. Only four have survived. Naegleria fowleri infects people by traveling up the nose and to the brain (shown here) where it consumes brain tissue. Photo: Dr. James Roberts, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta Signs and symptoms Early symptoms of PAM can include headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting. PAM progresses rapidly. Most people with PAM die within 1 to 18 days after symptoms begin. It usually leads to coma and death after 5 days. As PAM progresses, symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, and hallucinations. Keep Reading Symptoms of Naegleria fowleri Infection Exposure risks Brain infections caused by Naegleria fowleri usually occur after someone goes swimming or diving in a lake, river, or other fresh water during summer months.

Keep Reading What Causes Naegleria fowleri Infection Reducing risk To help protect yourself against a Naegleria fowleri infection: Hold your nose or wear a nose clip if you are jumping or diving into fresh water. Always keep your head above water in hot springs. Don't dig in shallow water because the ameba is more likely to live there. Use distilled or boiled tap water when rinsing your sinuses or cleansing your nasal passages. Keep Reading How to Prevent Naegleria fowleri Infection When Rinsing Sinuses or Nasal Passages Diagnosis A Naegleria fowleri infection is diagnosed using laboratory tests. These tests are available in only a few labs in the United States, including CDC. Because these infections are so rare and hard to detect, diagnosis sometimes happens after a person has died. Contact a healthcare provider immediately if you or a loved one is experiencing symptoms of PAM. Treatment and recovery Naegleria fowleri can cause PAM which destroys brain tissue and causes the brain to swell. Unfortunately, more than 97% of people with PAM have died from the infection.

It can affect the lungs, brain, and skin. Nocardiosis is most common in people with weakened immune systems. The disease is treated with commonly available antibiotics. The infection can prove fatal in as many as 4 out of 10 cases. More Information For Everyone Health Care Providers Overview Nocardiosis is a disease caused by bacteria found in soil. It can affect the lungs, brain, and skin. While the disease can be treated with commonly available antibiotics, it can be fatal in 4 out of 10 cases. In the United States, about 500-1,000 new cases of nocardiosis occur every year. About 6 in 10 people who get nocardiosis have weakened immune systems. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of nocardiosis can be different depending on which part of your body is affected. Nocardiosis usually affects the lungs. If your lungs are infected, you can experience: Fever Weight loss Night sweats Cough Chest pain Pneumonia If you get a lung infection from nocardia, the infection can spread to your brain. If your central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) is infected, you can experience: Headache Weakness Confusion Seizures Nocardiosis and skin infections You can get a skin infection when soil containing Nocardia bacteria gets into open wounds or cuts in your skin. Farming or gardening without gloves and protective clothing increases the risk of cuts, thorn pricks, or other minor injuries. If your skin is infected, you can develop skin ulcers or shallow sores. You might also have nodules, which are growths beneath the surface of the skin. Sometimes, the nodules drain when the infection spreads to your lymph nodes. People at risk People who have had an organ transplant and people with very weak immune systems have a higher risk for nocardiosis Several diseases and conditions can cause people's immune systems to be weak.",condition

In fact, for every woman who gets nocardiosis, there are about 3 men who get the disease. How it spreads Nocardiosis is a disease caused by a type of bacteria called Nocardia that is found in the environment. It's typically in standing water, decaying plants, and soil. Nocardia and other related bacteria are considered opportunistic germs. These are bacteria that infect people and animals when the conditions are right. They can cause severe infections in people with weakened immune systems who have difficulty fighting off infections. People with cancer or those taking certain medications like steroids could have weakened immune systems. Infection occurs when: Someone breathes in dust that contains the bacteria Soil or water carrying nocardia bacteria gets into the skin through a cut A hospitalized patient gets the bacteria in their surgery wound via contaminated medical equipment Nocardiosis can show up in the body as a skin or lung infection. It can also occur as an infection that has spread throughout the body (disseminated infection). In the United States, nocardiosis most often shows up as a lung infection. No matter the cause, nocardiosis needs to be treated. If not, it can spread to other parts of the body, including the spinal cord and the brain. The brain is the most common site of disseminated infection. Fact‎ More than 8 in 10 of patients die after developing nocardiosis of the brain or spinal cord. The risk for death is much higher for patients with very weak immune systems. Prevention If you have a weakened immune system, you should take certain precautions when working in the soil: Wear shoes and gloves.",condition
cdc_0035_3,Nocardia Infection,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/nocardiosis/about/index.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Wear clothing covering your skin Bandage open wounds and cuts. If you have had an organ transplant, you might be given antibiotics to prevent bacterial infections. Some studies have shown this might prevent nocardiosis. Outbreaks of nocardiosis in hospitals are rare. A few outbreaks have been linked to other patients and healthcare workers. One outbreak occurred from the release of bacteria in the air during hospital construction work. Hospitals maintain strong infection control practices to avoid outbreaks of nocardiosis. Diagnosis Talk to your doctor if‎ you have an injury that won't heal or you're having nocardiosis symptoms. You should also tell your doctor how you were wounded. That information helps with getting a correct diagnosis and the best treatment. Your healthcare provider can help you find out if you have nocardiosis by performing tests that look for the bacteria. Your healthcare provider may need to take samples from an infected part of your body. For example: Lungs Mucus from the lower airways Skin Brain tissue Treatment People with nocardiosis may need to take multiple antibiotics for several months. Sometimes, antibiotic treatment lasts up to a year or more. Longer treatments are meant to prevent symptoms from returning. In addition to treatment, abscesses or wound infections may need to be surgically drained. Some types of Nocardia bacteria are resistant to certain antibiotics. So, laboratory testing is needed to find out which type (species) is causing the infection. Healthcare providers might run tests to find out which antibiotic treatment will stop your infection.

Causes People get paracoccidioidomycosis after breathing in the fungus Paracoccidioides from the environment in certain parts of Mexico and Central and South America. Paracoccidioidomycosis does not spread from person to person. The exact time between inhaling the fungus and getting paracoccidioidomycosis is not known. The specific habitat of the fungus Paracoccidioides is also not exactly known. It has been found in soil near armadillo burrows. Testing and diagnosis Healthcare providers use a patient's symptoms, laboratory tests, and imaging tests, such as a chest X-ray, to diagnose paracoccidioidomycosis. A healthcare provider will often perform a biopsy (take a small sample from the body part that is affected). The sample is sent to a laboratory for a fungal culture or to be examined under the microscope. A blood test can also help diagnose paracoccidioidomycosis. Treatment and recovery Paracoccidioidomycosis is treated with antifungal medicines such as itraconazole and amphotericin B. While antibiotic medicines are made to kill bacteria and not fungi, an antibiotic medicine called trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) can help treat infections. TMP/SMX is also known as co-trimoxazole and by several different brand names, including Bactrim, Septra, and Cotrim. Patients usually need treatment for about one year. Statistics More than 15,000 cases of paracoccidioidomycosis have been recorded since 1930. About 80% of recorded cases have occurred in Brazil. Many more cases likely occur, however, because the disease is underrecognized. Paracoccidioidomycosis is likely rare in the United States, where it is not a reportable disease.

Overview Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a rare, serious lung infection caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii . Most people with PCP have a weakened immune system due to a medical condition, like HIV, or from medication, like corticosteroids. Pneumocystis pneumonia is a risk for people with health conditions. Symptoms The symptoms of PCP can develop over several days or weeks and include: Fever Cough Difficulty breathing Chest pain Chills Fatigue (tiredness) Risk factors Most people who get PCP have weakened immune systems. Some diseases and conditions that increase risk of PCP include: HIV/AIDS (About 30% to 40% of people who get PCP have HIV/AIDS) Chronic lung diseases Cancer Inflammatory diseases or autoimmune diseases (for example, lupus or rheumatoid arthritis) Solid organ or stem cell transplant The other people who get PCP are usually taking medicine (such as corticosteroids) that lowers the body’s ability to fight germs or sickness. How it spreads PCP spreads from person to person through the air. Some healthy adults can carry the Pneumocystis fungus in their lungs without having symptoms. They can spread it to other people, including those with weakened immune systems. Prevention There is no vaccine to prevent PCP.

Other medicines are available for people who cannot take TMP/SMX. Testing Healthcare providers test for PCP by taking a sample of mucus (sputum) from the patient's lungs. Sometimes, a small sample of lung tissue (a biopsy) is used to diagnose PCP or take a blood sample. Samples are analyzed in clinical laboratories. One method that can be used is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which detects PCP DNA. A blood test to detect β-D-glucan (a part of the cell wall of many different types of fungi) can also help diagnose PCP. Treatment and recovery PCP is treated with prescription medication. The most common treatment is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), a medication also known as co-trimoxazole and by several different brand names, i.e. Bactrim, Septra, and Cotrim. This medicine is given by mouth or through a vein for 3 weeks. TMP/SMX can cause side effects such as rash and fever. Other medications are available for patients who cannot take TMP/SMX. Note: Most fungal diseases are treated with antifungal medications. Antibiotics typically are used to treat infections caused by bacteria. Unlike other fungal diseases PCP is treated with an antibiotic and antifungal medications do not work to treat it. Research There is no national surveillance for PCP in the United States. There were 10,590 estimated U.S. hospitalizations due to Pneumocystis pneumonia in 2017. History of HIV and PCP During the 1980s, clusters of PCP were one of the first signs of the HIV/AIDS epidemic emerging in the United States. It became one of the main AIDS-defining illnesses with an estimated three-in-four people living with HIV/AIDS developed PCP. Since then, PCP in people living with HIV has decreased substantially due to antiretroviral therapy and treatment with TMP/SMX.

The most common ways people get sick are from eating or drinking contaminated food or water and contact with someone who is sick or has recently been sick with Shigella infection. Shigella can also be spread during sexual activity with a sick person. More Information For Everyone Health Care Providers Public Health What it is Shigella bacteria cause an infection called shigellosis . Shigella cause an estimated 450,000 infections in the United States each year, and antimicrobial resistant infections result in an estimated $93 million in direct medical costs. The four species of Shigella are: Shigella sonnei (the most common species in the United States) Shigella flexneri Shigella boydii Shigella dysenteriae S. dysenteriae and S. boydii are rare in the United States, though they continue to be important causes of disease in areas with less access to resources. Shigella dysenteriae type 1 can be deadly. Symptoms Symptoms usually start 1–2 days after infection and last 7 days. Most people with shigellosis experience: Diarrhea that can be bloody or prolonged (lasting more than 3 days) Fever Stomach pain Feeling the need to pass stool (poop) even when the bowels are empty Keep Reading: Signs and Symptoms of Shigella Infection Who is at risk Some groups of people are more likely to get sick with shigellosis than others. Children younger than 5 years old are the most likely to get shigellosis, but people of all ages can get the disease. Many outbreaks occur in early care and education settings and schools . Travelers to places where water and food may be unsafe and sanitation is poor are more likely to get a Shigella infection. They are also more likely to become sick with types of Shigella that are more difficult to treat . Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men* (GBMSM) have factors that put them at increased risk for Shigella infection.",condition
cdc_0039_2,Shigella Infection,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/about/index.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Although rates are higher among GBMSM, the risk is present for any sexual activity involving stool exposure. People who are experiencing homelessness are at high risk for Shigella infection when there is shigellosis spread in the community. They may face challenges in their living situations that increase the risk for disease transmission, which can result in outbreaks. How it spreads Shigella spreads easily; swallowing just a small amount of Shigella germs can make you sick. Shigella germs are in poop, so anything that gets contaminated by poop can potentially spread the germs. Shigella can spread from one person to another or through contaminated water, food, surfaces, or objects. Keep Reading: How Shigella Spreads Prevention You can take steps to avoid getting or spreading Shigella. Wash your hands with soap and water at key times . Take care when changing diapers . Avoid swallowing water while swimming. When traveling internationally, follow safe food and water habits and clean your hands often. If you or your partner has been diagnosed with shigellosis , do not have sex for at least two weeks after the diarrhea ends. Keep Reading: Preventing Shigella Infection Treatment and recovery People who have shigellosis usually get better without antibiotic treatment in 5 to 7 days. People with mild shigellosis may need only fluids and rest. Your healthcare provider may prescribe medicine to treat illness caused by Shigella .

Most of the time, staph does not cause any harm, but it can sometimes cause infections. Some types of Staphylococcus aureus are resistant to common antibiotic treatments. Overview Staphylococcus aureus (staph) is a bacterium commonly found on the skin and in the nose of about 30% of individuals. Most of the time staph does not cause any harm, but it can sometimes cause infections. In healthcare settings, infections can lead to serious or fatal outcomes. Signs and symptoms Staph infections can look like pimples, boils or other skin conditions. In healthcare settings, staph infections can be serious or fatal, leading to: Bloodstream infections or sepsis when bacteria get in the bloodstream. Pneumonia , which most often affects people with underlying lung disease, including those on mechanical ventilators. Endocarditis (infection of the heart valves), which can lead to heart failure or stroke. Osteomyelitis (bone infection), caused by staph bacteria traveling in the bloodstream or put there by direct contact such as trauma (puncture wound of the foot). Risk factors In the community, people are at greater risk of staph infections if they have chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, cancer, vascular disease, etc.) or inject drugs.

It can cause stomachaches, diarrhea, and rashes. Most people have no symptoms, but people with immune disorders or taking drugs affecting immunity can get severely ill. Antiparasitic drugs can treat severe cases of strongyloidiasis. Overview Strongyloides is a type of nematode or roundworm parasite. A parasite is an organism (a living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. It can infect people through exposed skin, such as bare feet, and cause a disease called strongyloidiasis. Strongyloidiasis can cause stomachaches, diarrhea, and rashes. Most people infected with Strongyloides have no symptoms and may not know they're infected. However, people who have weakened immune systems can become severely ill or die from strongyloidiasis if not treated. Strongyloides is usually found in tropical regions, particularly Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. However, it can occur anywhere, especially in warm, wet, rural areas. The best way to prevent Strongyloides infection is to wear shoes when you are walking on soil, avoid contact with fecal matter or sewage, and clean up after dogs. Use improved sanitation facilities , if available, to ensure people do not have contact with human waste. Signs and symptoms Most people infected with Strongyloides do not have any symptoms.

When did CDC abortion surveillance start? CDC began abortion surveillance in 1969 to document the number and characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions. Many states and jurisdictions conduct abortion surveillance. This information is voluntarily reported as aggregate data to CDC. CDC’s surveillance system compiles the information from states and jurisdictions on legal induced abortions. How does CDC define abortion? For the purpose of surveillance, legal induced abortion is defined as ""an intervention performed within the limits of state and jurisdiction law by a licensed clinician (for instance, a physician, nurse-midwife, nurse practitioner, physician assistant) intended to terminate a suspected or known intrauterine pregnancy and that does not result in a live birth."" This definition excludes management of intrauterine fetal death, early pregnancy failure/loss, ectopic pregnancy, or retained products of conception. Most states and jurisdictions that collect abortion data report whether an abortion was performed by medication or surgery. Are states and jurisdictions required to report their abortion data to CDC? No, states and jurisdictions voluntarily report aggregate data to CDC for inclusion in its annual Abortion Surveillance report. CDC's Division of Reproductive Health prepares surveillance reports as data become available. There is no national requirement for data submission or reporting. States and jurisdictions needing guidance on abortion surveillance may contact CDC at Contact CDC-INFO . How is the report prepared and formatted?

Adenovirus vaccine can prevent infection with some types of adenovirus. Adenoviruses can cause illness that is usually mild, but can be serious in some cases. People with weakened immune systems, or existing lung or heart disease, are at higher risk of developing severe illness from an adenovirus infection. Adenovirus infection can cause: Common cold or flu-like symptoms Fever Sore throat Acute bronchitis (inflammation of the airways of the lungs, sometimes called a ""chest cold"") Pneumonia (infection of the lungs) Diarrhea Conjunctivitis (pink eye) Infection with adenovirus can also rarely lead to more serious problems, such as severe pneumonia or neurologic disease (conditions that affect the brain and spinal cord), and even death. Some people who are infected may have to be hospitalized. Adenoviruses are usually spread from an infected person to others through close personal contact such as touching or shaking hands, through the air by coughing and sneezing, or through handling objects that an infected person has touched. Some adenoviruses can spread through an infected person's stool, for example, during diaper changing. Adenovirus can also spread through the water, such as in swimming pools, but this is less common. Certain adenovirus types (including Type 4 and Type 7) have caused severe outbreaks of respiratory illness among military recruits. Adenovirus vaccine Adenovirus vaccine is only available for United States military personnel. There is currently no adenovirus vaccine available to the general public. Adenovirus vaccine contains live adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7. It will prevent most illness caused by these two virus types.",prevention

The tablets should be swallowed whole, not chewed or crushed. The vaccine is approved for military personnel 17 through 50 years of age. It is recommended by the Department of Defense for military recruits entering basic training. It may also be recommended for other military personnel at high risk for adenovirus infection. Adenovirus vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Talk with your health care provider Tell your vaccine provider if the person getting the vaccine: Has had an allergic reaction after a previous dose of adenovirus vaccine , or has any severe, life-threatening allergies . Has a weakened immune system . Is younger than 17 or older than 50 years . Is pregnant or nursing , or planning to become pregnant. Is unable to swallow the vaccine tablets whole without chewing them. Is currently experiencing vomiting or diarrhea . In some cases, your health care provider may decide to postpone adenovirus vaccination to a future visit. People with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting adenovirus vaccine. Virus from the vaccine can be shed in the stool for up to 28 days after vaccination. To minimize the risk of spreading vaccine virus to other people during this period, observe proper personal hygiene , such as frequent hand washing, especially following bowel movements. This is especially important if you have close contact with children 7 years of age and younger, with anyone having a weakened immune system, or with pregnant women.

An allergic reaction could occur after the vaccinated person leaves the clinic. If you see signs of a severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, or weakness), call 9-1-1 and get the person to the nearest hospital. For other signs that concern you, call your health care provider. Adverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

NIOSH studies how to protect workers from harmful effects of aerosols. NIOSH offers guides and tools to keep workers safe from harmful aerosols. Overview An aerosol can be defined as a suspension of particles or droplets in air. Aerosols may include airborne dusts, mists, fumes, or smoke. Suspended particle sizes may range from a few nanometers (nm) to hundreds of micrometers (µm) in diameter. For comparison a human hair may be between 20 to 180 µm in diameter. Particles can be manufactured or naturally occurring. A welder can potentially be exposed to welding fumes. Aerosols in the workplace may pose both health and safety hazards. Aerosols are encountered across multiple industry sectors. Particles can be inhaled, absorbed by the skin, enter the eyes or be ingested. Factors such as particle size, composition, shape, and concentration, can determine whether particles can cause harm to workers. Harmful effects can be either short or long term. Safety hazards may include slips, fires, or explosions. Research NIOSH has carried out extensive aerosol research in exposure assessment, epidemiology, toxicology, risk mitigation, aerosol sampling and method development. This assists our understanding in: How aerosols are formed and transported through the workplace. Which workers may be most impacted and to what extent. The health implications to workers. The safety implications in the workplace. How to sample for and measure aerosols in the workplace. How to reduce or eliminate the health and safety hazards.

Older workers are a large and growing part of the workforce. An age-friendly workplace benefits all workers, but especially older workers. Overview Aging is a process experienced by all workers. For many older adults, work provides economic security and social interaction, and improves quality of life. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2021 nearly one in four American workers was age 55 or older. Labor force participation rates for older workers are projected to increase through 2030. Participation rates for workers of other age groups are projected to remain relatively level or decline. It is important to support and protect the health and safety of workers, especially those of advanced age. Attributes of productive aging A life-span perspective views aging as an adaptive and dynamic process. Aging impacts your body, your mind, and how you interact with the world around you. Changes that occur as workers age do not take place in a vacuum. In the workplace, the following factors play a role in productive aging: The nature of work and its structure Workplace relationships Work-related events, like career progression and retirement Ageist beliefs that may interfere with support of productive aging Benefits of an aging workforce Aging workers may provide the following benefits to their workplaces: Institutional knowledge Applicable experience Low levels of stress on the job Get along well with their coworkers Cautious on the job Health, safety, and aging Aging affects a variety of health conditions and outcomes, including chronic conditions and the likelihood of workplace injury. Chronic conditions and aging More than 75% of all workers have at least one chronic condition. The two most common health conditions affecting older workers are arthritis and hypertension. Nearly half of workers over age 55 experience at least one of these conditions.",condition
cdc_0062_2,Aging in the Workplace,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/aging/about/,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Since many older workers experience chronic conditions, they may be absent from work. On the other hand, there may be an increase in ""presenteeism."" Presenteeism is when workers show up to work sick. Safety and aging Overall, older workers tend to experience fewer workplace injuries than their younger colleagues. This difference may be due to their experience or because they are more careful and aware of their physical limitations. Older workers often require more time to heal from workplace injuries. It is important for employers to have a well-planned return to work program. Older workers experience a higher rate of workplace fatalities. Employers need to be mindful of how best to adapt the conditions of work to protect workers. They should also explore opportunities for preventative programs that can maintain or build the health of employees through their working life. Recommendations Creating an age-friendly workplace Many age-friendly work practices benefit workers of all ages. Managers can create age-friendly workplaces by: Prioritizing workplace flexibility and matching tasks to abilities. Give workers a say in their schedule and work tasks. Use self-paced work, rest breaks, and less repetitive tasks. Provide reasonable accommodations after illness or injury. Avoid prolonged, sedentary work. Managing hazards like noise, slip/trip hazards, and physical hazards. Providing and designing ergonomic-friendly work environments. Providing health promotion and lifestyle interventions. Investing in training and building worker skills and competencies. Help older employees learn and adapt to new technologies. Providing age-inclusive management training for supervisors.

Particle Pollution (Particulate Matter) Particle pollution , also called particulate matter, is made up of particles (tiny pieces) of solids or liquids in the air. These particles include: Dust Dirt Soot Smoke Drops of liquid Some particles are big enough or dark enough to see, like smoke. Others are so small that you can't see them. Breathing in particle pollution can be harmful to your health. Larger particles, called PM10, irritate the eyes, nose, and throat. Dust from roads, farms, dry riverbeds, construction sites, and mines are types of PM10. Smaller particles, called PM2.5, are more dangerous because they can get into the deep parts of your lungs — or even into your blood.

Learn how to navigate air quality conditions with the Air Quality Index and find other helpful resources available to you. What you can do The Air Quality Index (AQI) Sometimes the air quality outdoors may not be safe for everyone. What can you do? Pay attention to the Air Quality Index (AQI) . The AQI tells you when high levels of air pollution are predicted and how air pollution affects your health. Finding the AQI is easy. It's on the Web, on many local TV weather forecasts, or you can sign up for free e-mail tools or download the AirNow app . Download Air Quality Index scale The AQI is easy to use. If the AQI predicts a ""Code Orange"" (unhealthy for sensitive groups) day don't cancel your plans—use the AQI to help you plan a better time or place for them. The AQI tells you about major air pollutants in the U.S. that are regulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency, including ozone and particle pollution. Ozone and particle pollution may harm the health of hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. Ozone and particle pollution Let's say that the ozone level where you live is predicted to be Code Orange tomorrow. If you're a runner—even if you're healthy—that air quality could hurt you. Using the AQI, you can plan your run for when ozone levels will be lower, shorten your run or walk instead, or run on a treadmill indoors. Particle pollution has been linked to heart attacks and strokes, and even death in people with heart disease. On a day when particle pollution will be at Code Orange, do something less intense. Walk instead of run or do only lighter outdoor work. Use the AQI Wherever You Go Don't forget to check the AQI when you're on vacation or travelling within the U.S. No matter where you go, you can always access the AQI. Check the AQI now!",condition

There is no known safe amount of alcohol use during pregnancy. There is no safe time during pregnancy to drink alcohol. All types of alcohol can be harmful, including red or white wine, beer, and liquor. Why it's important Alcohol use during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, stillbirth, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Alcohol use during pregnancy can cause a range of lifelong behavioral, intellectual, and physical disabilities known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) . During pregnancy, alcohol can pass from the pregnant woman to the fetus and affect its development. Not all babies will be affected by alcohol during pregnancy. However, it is impossible to know which babies will be affected. There is no safe time for alcohol use during pregnancy. Alcohol can cause problems for the baby throughout pregnancy, including before a woman knows she is pregnant. Alcohol use in the first 3 months of pregnancy can cause the baby to have abnormal facial features. Growth and central nervous system problems (for example, low birthweight, behavioral problems) can occur from alcohol use anytime during pregnancy. The baby's brain is developing throughout pregnancy and can be affected by exposure to alcohol at any time. It is never too late to stop alcohol use during pregnancy. Stopping alcohol use will improve the baby's health and well-being. There is no known safe amount of alcohol use during pregnancy. Common questions I just found out I'm pregnant. I've stopped drinking now, but I was drinking in the first few weeks before I knew I was pregnant. What should I do now? The most important thing is that you have completely stopped alcohol use after learning of your pregnancy. It is never too late to stop alcohol use during pregnancy.",condition

Make sure you get regular prenatal checkups. If you used any amount of alcohol while you were pregnant, talk with your child's healthcare provider as soon as possible and share your concerns. I drank wine during my last pregnancy and my baby turned out fine. Why shouldn't I drink again during this pregnancy? Every pregnancy is different. Alcohol use during pregnancy might affect one baby more than another. You could have one child who is born healthy and another child who is born with problems. There is no known safe amount of alcohol use during your pregnancy or when you are trying to get pregnant. There is also no safe time for alcohol use during pregnancy.

Alpha-gal is a molecule found in most mammals, such as cows and pigs, but not in people. People with AGS can have an allergic reaction after eating red meat or being exposed to products containing alpha-gal. The best way to protect yourself and your family from AGS is to prevent tick bites. What is alpha-gal syndrome? Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS) is a serious, potentially life-threatening allergy and tickborne disease. Alpha-gal is a molecule (galactose-α-1,3-galactose) that is naturally produced in the bodies of most mammals but not in people. It is also found in the saliva (spit) of some ticks. When a tick bites, it can transfer alpha-gal from its saliva into a person's blood. The body's natural defenses, or immune system, can identify alpha-gal as a threat and trigger an allergic reaction. Symptoms occur after people eat red meat or are exposed to other products made from mammals . Because of this, AGS is also known as red meat allergy or tick bite meat allergy. View Larger Download In the United States, the lone star tick is most often associated with AGS. A few cases of AGS have been reported following bites from blacklegged and western blacklegged ticks.

Ammonia is a toxic clear gas or liquid. Signs and symptoms of ammonia exposure depend on how you were exposed. If exposed, get away from the area, get clean, and get help. Background Ammonia occurs naturally and is produced by human activity. Ammonia is made up of nitrogen and hydrogen. It is an important source of nitrogen, which is needed by plants and animals. It is widely used in fertilizers and pharmaceuticals. At room temperature, ammonia is a clear, colorless gas. Ammonia can also be a clear, colorless liquid that dissolves in water. Changing ammonia to a liquid can help with its storage and transportation. Ammonia can be recognized by its strong smell, which is like the smell of rotting fish. Ammonia reacts with strong oxidizers, acids, halogens (including chlorine bleach), and salts of silver, zinc, copper, and other heavy metals. Ammonia is also commonly used in a liquid form mixed with water, such as household ammonia. Signs and symptoms Normal amounts of ammonia in the environment do not cause health effects in humans. Exposure to high levels of ammonia may hurt your skin, eyes, throat, and lungs and cause coughing and burns. Lung damage and death may occur after exposure to very high levels of ammonia. Most people will smell the chemical or feel irritation that tells you that you are exposed to ammonia. Exposure for a long time may affect people's ability to sense the chemical. Effects depend on how the person was exposed, how much they were exposed to, and how long they were exposed for. Some people with asthma or other chronic lung diseases may be more sensitive to breathing ammonia than others.",condition

Exposure Warning!‎ Household ammonia can release gas if it is mixed with certain other cleaning products. Do not mix household cleaners! If ammonia is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or breathing in the gas. Ammonia gas is lighter than air, so it will rise. If ammonia is in water, people can be exposed by touching or drinking water that contains ammonia. Ammonia in food Ammonia is unlikely to be eaten or drunk, because it has a very bad smell and taste. Avoid using or eating food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual. Do not eat food that may have touched liquid ammonia if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an unbroken sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected by an ammonia release. Wash the outside of the container before using. Follow any directions by local authorities. What to do if you are exposed Get away Get away from the area where the ammonia was released and breathe fresh air. If the ammonia release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place. Make sure windows are closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the ammonia does not come inside. If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the ammonia was released. If the ammonia release was indoors, get out of the building. If the ammonia release was from household cleaners or chemicals, open windows and doors to let in fresh air. Leave the area until the gas has gone away. If you cannot get away, go to the lowest ground possible because ammonia is lighter than air and will rise.",condition

The bacteria that causes anthrax occurs naturally in soil worldwide. People usually get anthrax from infected animals or contaminated animal products. Call a healthcare provider immediately if you think you have been exposed to anthrax. Overview Anthrax is a serious disease usually caused by Bacillus anthracis bacteria. The bacteria are found naturally in soil around the world and commonly affect livestock and wild animals. People usually get sick with anthrax if they come in contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products. People can breathe in anthrax spores, eat food or drink water contaminated with spores, or get spores in a cut or scrape in the skin. Livestock and wild animals can become infected when they breathe in, eat, or drink spores in contaminated soil, plants, or water. These animals can include cattle, sheep, goats, antelope, and deer. Anthrax is rare in the United States. However, occasional outbreaks do happen in wild and domestic grazing animals such as cattle or deer. In the United States, veterinarians recommend yearly vaccination of livestock in areas where animals have had anthrax in the past. Types The type of illness a person develops depends on how anthrax enters the body: through the skin, lungs, or gastrointestinal system. All types of anthrax can cause death if they're not treated with antibiotics. Cutaneous anthrax Cutaneous anthrax happens when anthrax spores get into a cut or scape on the skin when a person handles infected animals or contaminated animal products like wool, hides, or hair. It mostly shows up on the head, neck, forearms, and hands. It's the most common form of anthrax infection, and it's also considered to be the least dangerous.",condition

Illness or injury may occur if workers’ normal anthropometric measurements are not considered in workplace designs and personal protective equipment. Definitions Anthropometry - the science that defines physical measures of a person's size, form, and functional capacities Functional capacity - the ability to complete certain work tasks based on human size or form How it works Anthropometric measurements are used to study the interaction of workers with tasks, tools, machines, vehicles, and personal protective equipment (PPE). These measurements are often used to determine the degree of protection against dangerous exposures, long term or short term. Many workers experience the benefit of applying anthropometric measurements. For example: Construction workers benefit from more than one size of fall harness. Truck drivers have a more ergonomic design of truck cabs. Firefighters have improved PPE for best fit. Police officers have improved uniform fit for more body types. Consider this Diverse workforces in many occupations require body-size data for designing adequate workplaces, systems, and PPE. Impacts Technological development in recent years has advanced the basic science of human size and shape studies in 3-dimensional (3D) forms. Computer-generated human models are now available for anthropometric analysis. These advances have made it possible to improve workplace and protective equipment design, and anthropometric fit within complex systems. Did you know? In applied anthropometry, collection and use of 3D anthropometric data have become a norm. This will ultimately result in a better fit between workers and their tools, systems, and work environments. Safety risks Designs that are incompatible with normal anthropometric measurements of a workforce may result in unwanted incidents.",condition
cdc_0080_2,Anthropometry,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/anthropometry/about/,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"For example: The misfit of a heavy equipment cabin to a worker may create operator blind spots that expose workers on foot to struck-by injuries. Inadequate length or configuration of seatbelts may lead to non-use of seat belts, which affect post-crash survivability. When PPE does not fit correctly it cannot sufficiently protect workers from health and safety exposures or hazards. What the data shows Existing data on the size and shape of industrial workers is limited. There is a lack of anthropometric data for the general worker population. Safety researchers have generally relied on data drawn from studies of military personnel. Most of these studies took place during the 1950s to 1970s. However, substantial anthropometric variability exists among the general worker population. They are quite different from the average military population. Industrial workers like agricultural, truck driver, and firefighter workforces, are also anthropometrically different from the average civilian population. 1 Resources Datasets Firefighter Anthropometry Datasets U.S. firefighter anthropometric information can be used to update specifications for fire apparatus and firefighter protective equipment.

Among other things, antineoplastic drugs can cause long-term organ damage, fertility issues, and even cancer. Learn about exposure risks and find resources about the dangers of antineoplastic agents. Overview of risk factors The adverse health effects associated with antineoplastic agents (cancer chemotherapy and cytotoxic drugs) in patients are well documented. The very nature of antineoplastic agents makes them harmful to healthy cells and tissues as well as the cancerous cells. Healthcare workers at risk For cancer patients with a life-threatening disease, there is great benefit to treatment with antineoplastic agents. However, for healthcare workers exposed to antineoplastic agents on the job, precautions are important to eliminate or reduce exposure. Pharmacists or nurses who prepare and/or administer these drugs have the highest potential for exposure to antineoplastic agents. Other healthcare workers at risk include: Physicians and operating room personnel. Shipping/receiving, custodial, laundry, and waste workers. Veterinary oncology workers. Health impacts In addition to acute or short-term effects related to treatment with antineoplastic agents, the following long-term or chronic effects have been documented: Liver and kidney damage. Bone marrow damage. Lung and heart damage. Infertility (temporary and permanent). Effects on reproduction and the developing fetus in pregnant women. Hearing impairment. Cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) found a number of antineoplastic agents are associated with cancer in patients. IARC currently lists: Eleven agents and two combined therapies as Group 1 (human carcinogens). Twelve agents as Group 2A (probable human carcinogens). Eleven agents as Group 2B (possible human carcinogens).",condition

In addition, analytical methods, such as measuring the drugs and/or their metabolites in worker urine, help document worker exposure. Worker exposures Some of the following biological endpoints are used to evaluate worker exposure: Urine mutagenicity. Chromosomal damage. Sister chromatid exchange. Micronuclei induction. DNA damage. HPRT mutations. Thioether excretion. Environmental exposures Similar analytical methods measure the level of environmental contamination in the workplace. Although limited studies on air sampling exist, there have been numerous studies published on environmental wipe sampling for these drugs. Preventing exposures In September 2004, The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) published an Alert: Preventing Occupational Exposures to Antineoplastic and Other Hazardous Drugs in Health Care Settings, 2004 , (DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 2004-165) . This topic page is an expanded bibliography of related publications drawn from the published literature related to the Alert.

What it is Aortic aneurysms can dissect or rupture: The force of blood pumping can split the layers of the artery wall, allowing blood to leak in between them. This process is called a dissection . The aneurysm can burst completely, causing bleeding inside the body. This is called a rupture . Dissections and ruptures are the cause of most deaths from aortic aneurysms. A thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest. An abdominal aortic aneurysm, which is more common, happens below the chest. Facts about aortic aneurysm in the United States Aortic aneurysms or aortic dissections were the cause of 9,904 deaths in 2019. 1 In 2019, about 59% of deaths due to aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection happen among men. 1 A history of smoking accounts for about 75% of all abdominal aortic aneurysms. 2 The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men aged 65 to 75 years old who have ever smoked should get an ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms, even if they have no symptoms. 3 Types Thoracic aortic aneurysm A thoracic aortic aneurysm happens in the chest. Men and women are equally likely to get thoracic aortic aneurysms, which become more common with increasing age. 4 Thoracic aortic aneurysms are usually caused by high blood pressure or sudden injury. Sometimes people with inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, get thoracic aortic aneurysms. Signs and symptoms of thoracic aortic aneurysm can include the following: Sharp, sudden pain in the chest or upper back. Shortness of breath. Trouble breathing or swallowing. Abdominal aortic aneurysm An abdominal aortic aneurysm happens below the chest. Abdominal aortic aneurysms happen more often than thoracic aortic aneurysms.",condition
cdc_0085_2,Aortic Aneurysm,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/about/aortic-aneurysm.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common in men and among people age 65 and older. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are more common among White people than among Black people. 5 Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually caused by atherosclerosis (hardened arteries), but infection or injury can also cause them. 6 Abdominal aortic aneurysms often don't have any symptoms. If an individual does have symptoms, they can include the following: Throbbing or deep pain in the back or side. Pain in the buttocks, groin, or legs. Other types Aneurysms can happen in other parts of your body. A ruptured aneurysm in the brain can cause a stroke . Peripheral aneurysms—those found in arteries other than the aorta—can happen in the neck, in the groin, or behind the knees. These aneurysms are less likely to rupture or dissect than aortic aneurysms, but they can form blood clots. These clots can break away and block blood flow through the artery. Risk factors Diseases and unhealthy behaviors that damage your heart and blood vessels also increase your risk for aortic aneurysm. Smoking is the most important behavior related to aortic aneurysm. Other factors include High blood pressure High blood cholesterol Atherosclerosis (hardened arteries) Some inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, can also increase your risk for aortic aneurysm. Your family may also have a history of aortic aneurysms that can increase your risk. Treatment and recovery The two main treatments for aortic aneurysms are medicines and surgery .

cdc_0087_1,Arsine,CDC,https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/arsine/index.asp,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"September 6, 2024 Arsine Chemical Fact Sheet Key points Arsine is a toxic gas that is colorless, flammable, and non-irritating. Signs and symptoms of arsine poisoning depend on exposure method and dose. If you were exposed, get clean and get medical care. Background Arsine is a colorless, flammable, non-irritating toxic gas with a mild garlic odor. Arsine is formed when arsenic comes in contact with an acid. Arsine is similar to a gas called stibine, which is formed when the metal antimony comes in contact with an acid. Stibine has health effects similar to those of arsine, but it is not as widely available. Stibine also has a noticeable ""rotten egg"" smell. Where it is found Arsine is most commonly used in the semiconductor and metals refining industries. Arsine was studied as a warfare agent during World War II, but it was never used on the battlefield. How it works After arsine enters the bloodstream, it damages the red blood cells. This can lead to symptoms of hemolytic anemia, when red blood cells die faster than the body can replace them. Signs and symptoms The effects of arsine poisoning depend on how much arsine a person was exposed to and how long the exposure was. Depending on the level of exposure to arsine, symptoms are likely to occur within the first 24 hours after exposure. Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to arsine. Exposure to low or moderate dose: Confusion, drowsiness, fatigue, and/or weakness Headache Muscle cramps Nausea, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain Rapid breathing or shortness of breath Red or dark urine Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice) Exposure to a large dose: Convulsions Loss of consciousness Paralysis Respiratory compromise, possibly leading to death Exposure Breathing in the gas is the most likely way of exposure after arsine is released into the air. Arsine is not absorbed into the body through the eyes and the skin.",condition
cdc_0087_2,Arsine,CDC,https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/arsine/index.asp,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"At lower amounts, people may not know they have been exposed to arsine, because it has no smell. At higher amounts, a mild garlic smell (however, do not rely on this as a warning). On the other hand, stibine has a strong smell, so people may notice that they may have been exposed. Most reports of exposure are when arsine is accidentally made in the workplace. Arsine gas is heavier than air, so it would be more likely to settle in lower areas. What to do if you are exposed Because there is no cure for arsine exposure, the best thing to do is avoid it. First, get fresh air by leaving the area where the arsine is. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the possibility of death from arsine. If arsine was released outside, move away from the area. If arsine was released indoors, get out of the building. Evacuate or ""shelter in place"" If you are near an arsine release, emergency teams may tell you to evacuate the area or ""shelter in place"" inside.

About asthma Asthma is a lung disease that is caused by chronic inflammation of the airways. It is one of the most common long-term diseases among children, but adults can have asthma, too. Asthma attacks occur when the lung airways tighten due to inflammation. Asthma attacks can be caused by ""triggers"" such as respiratory infections, allergy particles, chemical irritants, and air pollution. During an asthma attack, a person with asthma can experience symptoms such as wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and nighttime or early morning coughing. Often, asthma attacks can be prevented by limiting one's exposure to triggers and by properly using asthma medications. Keep Reading Asthma Flu and people with asthma People with asthma can develop swollen and sensitive airways, and flu can cause further inflammation of the airways and lungs. Flu can trigger asthma attacks and cause worsening of asthma symptoms. Flu also can lead to pneumonia and other acute respiratory diseases.

Work-related asthma is triggered or develops from exposures at work. Workplace irritants, allergens, and physical conditions are triggers. Work-related asthma symptoms are the same as non-work related asthma. Overview Work-related asthma is asthma triggered by exposures at work. Asthma affects the lungs and causes the airways to become narrow and inflamed. To control it, avoid triggers that cause asthma symptoms and take prescribed medicine. Many triggers can be in the workplace. Over 300 known substances in the workplace can cause or worsen asthma. Avoiding triggers can prevent asthma from getting worse. Worsening asthma or new onset asthma in a worker should raise questions about workplace causes. Asthma symptoms can develop shortly after exposure. However, they can also develop months or years after repeated exposures to harmful substances. Signs and symptoms Coughing at work can be a symptom of work-related asthma. Symptoms of work-related asthma are the same as symptoms for non-work-related asthma. They include: Wheezing Coughing Chest tightness Shortness of breath Asthma symptoms can come and go, and some workers might not have all of the symptoms. Workers can get work-related asthma even when using personal protective equipment such as respirators or face masks. Sometimes breathing problems start at work and continue after leaving work when exposure has stopped. How do I know if I have work-related asthma? Symptoms for work-related asthma tend to get better on weekends, vacations, or other times when away from work. However, in some cases, symptoms do not improve until extended time away from exposures or triggers. Your doctor can diagnose work-related asthma.

Your doctor will ask questions about your symptoms and will conduct a physical examination. The doctor might also order one or more tests, such as: Breathing tests (e.g., peak flow readings, spirometry, methacholine challenge) Allergy tests such as skin or blood tests If your doctor is concerned about a condition other than asthma, he/she might order other tests such as x-rays or other imaging tests. Causes Exposures from indoor water damage can trigger work-related asthma. Work-related asthma is associated with exposure to worksite triggers (irritants, allergens, and physical conditions). Examples of asthma triggers are: Animal dander, insects, and dust mites Chlorine-based cleaning products Cigarette smoke Materials from cockroaches Cold air Dust from wood, grain, flour, or green coffee beans Gases such as ozone Other possible triggers include: Irritant chemicals Metal dust Physical exertion Pollen and plants Strong fumes Vapors from chemicals (e.g., ammonia, isocyanates, and solvents) Wood smoke Symptom management Inhalers are often used to treat asthma attacks. The most important step of managing asthma is stopping or reducing exposure to triggers causing symptoms. Work with your doctor to develop a personal asthma control plan. Medical professionals often treat asthma with two general types of medicine: Quick -relief rescue inhalers (e.g., albuterol, levalbuterol) to open the airways. People use these medicines to treat asthma attacks or flare-ups. Quick relief medications are often used in combination with long-term control medicines such inhaled corticosteroids.

Some people who have AFib don’t know they have it and don’t have any symptoms. What it is Atrial fibrillation, often called AFib or AF, is the most common type of treated heart arrhythmia. An arrhythmia is when the heart beats too slowly, too fast, or in an irregular way. When a person has AFib, the normal beating in the upper chambers of the heart (the two atria) is irregular, and blood doesn't flow as well as it should from the atria to the lower chambers of the heart (the two ventricles). AFib may happen in brief episodes, or it may be a permanent condition. This illustration shows a normal heartbeat and an irregular heartbeat. Facts about AFib It is estimated that 12.1 million people in the US will have AFib in S 1 2 In 2021, AFib was mentioned on 232,030 death certificates and was the underlying cause of death in 28,037 of those deaths. 3 People of European descent are more likely to have AFib than Black people. Because the number of AFib cases increases with age and women generally live longer than men, more women than men experience AFib. Symptoms Some people who have AFib don't know they have it and don't have any symptoms. Others may experience one or more of the following symptoms: Irregular heartbeat. Heart palpitations (rapid, fluttering, or pounding). Lightheadedness. Extreme fatigue. Shortness of breath. Chest pain. Risk factors The risk for AFib increases with age. High blood pressure, the risk for which also increases with advancing age, accounts for about 1 in 5 cases of AFib. 4 Risk factors for AFib include: 4 5 Advancing age. High blood pressure. Obesity. European ancestry. Diabetes. Heart failure. Ischemic heart disease. Hyperthyroidism. Chronic kidney disease. Moderate to heavy alcohol use. Smoking.

When standard stroke risk factors were accounted for, AFib was associated with an approximately fivefold increased risk of ischemic stroke. 6 AFib causes about 1 in 7 strokes. 7 Strokes caused by complications from AFib tend to be more severe than strokes with other underlying causes. Strokes happen when blood flow to the brain is blocked by a blood clot or by fatty deposits called plaque in the blood vessel lining. Treatment and recovery Treatment for AFib can include: Medicines to control the heart's rhythm and rate. Blood-thinning medicine to prevent blood clots from forming and reduce stroke risk. Surgery. Medicine and healthy lifestyle changes to manage AFib risk factors. What are the consequences of AFib? More than 454,000 hospitalizations with AFib as the primary diagnosis happen each year in the US. 4 The condition contributes to about 158,000 deaths each year. 3 The death rate from AFib as the primary or a contributing cause of death has been rising for more than two decades. 7 View Larger The map shows that concentrations of counties with the highest Cardiac Dysrhythmia Hospitalization Rates are located primarily in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky North Carolina, West Virginia, Ohio, and Michigan.

B virus can spread from infected macaque monkeys to people. If you are exposed to a macaque monkey, begin first aid immediately and see a healthcare provider. What it is B virus infection is extremely rare. However, it can lead to severe brain damage or death if you do not get treatment immediately. People typically get infected with B virus if they are bitten or scratched by an infected macaque monkey; or have contact with the monkey's eyes, nose, or mouth. Signs and symptoms Symptoms typically start within one month of being exposed to B virus. However, they could appear in as little as 3 to 7 days. The first indications of B virus infection are typically flu-like symptoms, like fever and chills. Then, you may develop small blisters in the wound or area on your body that had contact with the monkey.

Treatment and recovery Get first aid immediately‎ If you are exposed to a macaque monkey, get first aid and seek immediate medical attention. Follow the steps below. Thoroughly wash the wound or area on your body that had contact with the monkey and gently scrub with soap, detergent, or iodine for 15 minutes. Run water over the wound or area for 15 to 20 minutes more. Tell the healthcare provider that you have been exposed to a macaque monkey that may be infected with B virus. If you got exposed to a macaque, wash right away and tell your doctor. Medications If your healthcare provider determines that you need treatment for B virus exposure or infection, you may be given antiviral medications. Timely first aid and treatment for high-risk exposures is crucial to preventing life-threatening disease. How animals are affected Macaque monkeys housed in primate facilities usually become infected with B virus by the time they reach adulthood. However, even when they are infected with B virus, monkeys typically do not have symptoms, or have just mild disease.

It spreads through tick bites, primarily by blacklegged (deer) ticks. Some people show no symptoms, others have flu-like symptoms. Babesiosis is preventable and treatable. Overview Babesiosis is a disease caused by microscopic parasites that infect red blood cells. A parasite is an organism (living thing) that lives on or inside another organism. Although there are many different species (types) of Babesia parasite found in animals, only a few infect people. The most common species to infect people in the United States is Babesia microti . Signs and symptoms Many people with Babesiosis do not feel sick and have no symptoms. However, some people might get flu-like symptoms, such as: Fever Chills Sweats Headache Body aches Loss of appetite Nausea Fatigue Since the parasites attack red blood cells, babesiosis can lead to hemolytic anemia. Hemolytic anemia occurs when your red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be replaced. Babesiosis can become a serious, even life-threatening illness for certain people, especially those who: Do not have a spleen Have a weak immune system for other reasons such as cancer, lymphoma, or HIV Have serious health issues such as liver or kidney disease Are older (> 50 years old) Symptoms, if they appear, may start around a week after infection, but usually develop over a few weeks or months, or longer. How it spreads In the U.S. most Babesia infections are from blacklegged or deer tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) bites. Ticks are typically found in wooded, brushy, or grassy areas. Currently, most babesiosis cases occur in the Northeast and upper Midwest. Other less common ways of getting infected with Babesia include: Getting a blood transfusion that has the parasite in it. If a mother has babesiosis, she might pass it to her baby during pregnancy or when the baby is born.",condition

BV can occur without sexual activity, but factors like douching and multiple partners increase the risk. It can increase the risk of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and complications during pregnancy. What is bacterial vaginosis (BV)? Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a condition that happens when there is too much of certain bacteria in the vagina, causing an imbalance. Signs and symptoms How common is BV? BV is the most common vaginal condition in women ages 15-44. Douching, not using condoms, and having new or multiple sex partners can upset the normal balance of vaginal bacteria, increasing your risk for getting BV. How it spreads How does BV spread? Researchers do not know the cause of BV. However, we do know the condition most often occurs in those who are sexually active. BV is a result of an imbalance of ""good"" and ""harmful"" bacteria in a vagina. Douching, not using condoms , and having new or multiple sex partners can upset the normal balance of vaginal bacteria, increasing your risk for getting BV. We also do not know how sex causes BV. There also is no research to show that treating a sex partner affects whether someone gets BV. Having BV can increase your chances of getting other STDs. Douching, not using condoms, and having new or multiple sex partners can upset the normal balance of vaginal bacteria, increasing your risk for getting BV. BV rarely affects those who have never had sex. You cannot get BV from toilet seats, bedding, or swimming pools. Prevention How can I avoid getting BV? Healthcare providers and scientists do not completely understand how BV spreads or know how best to prevent it. The following basic prevention steps may help lower your risk of getting BV: Not having sex Limiting your number of sex partners Not douching Using condoms the right way every time you have sex I’m pregnant.",condition

If you are pregnant and have BV, your baby is more likely to be born early (premature) or at a low birth weight. Low birth weight means having a baby that weighs less than 5.5 pounds at birth. Treatment and recovery How do I know if I have BV? Many people with BV do not have symptoms. If you do have symptoms, you may notice: A thin white or gray vaginal discharge Pain, itching, or burning in the vagina A strong fish-like odor, especially after sex Burning when peeing Itching around the outside of the vagina How will my healthcare provider know if I have BV? A healthcare provider will examine your vagina for signs of discharge. They also can test a sample of vaginal fluid to determine if BV is present. Is there a cure for BV? A healthcare provider can treat BV with antibiotics. If you have symptoms, you should be checked and treated by a healthcare provider. It is important to take all the medicine your provider prescribes, even if your symptoms go away. Treatment also may reduce the risk for getting other STDs. BV can return even after treatment. Male sex partners of women with BV do not need treatment. However, BV can spread between female sex partners. What happens if I don't receive treatment? At times, BV will go away without treatment.

In their current form, bat influenza viruses do not appear to pose a threat to human health. The bat species currently known to carry bat influenza viruses are not native to the continental United States, but they are common in Central and South America. Causes and public health implications Experts from CDC and Universidad del Valle (University of the Valley) discovered influenza A in bats during a 2009-2010 study in Guatemala. They first found influenza A in bats in little yellow-shouldered bats. 1 Yellow-shouldered bat found in Guatemala. Photo credit: CDC/OID/NCEZID – Amy T. Gilbert. Bat influenza viruses have since been detected in some other species of bats in Central and South America. 2 The discovery of bat influenza viruses is important for public health because bats represent a new animal species that may act as a source of influenza viruses. Influenza viruses are already known to spread and cause disease in other animals. Laboratory research conducted at CDC and elsewhere suggests that bat influenza viruses would need to change significantly to be able to infect and spread easily among humans. Risk of bat flu spreading to humans CDC laboratory research suggests bat influenza viruses would need to undergo significant changes to become capable of infecting and spreading easily among people. Therefore, these viruses do not appear to pose a risk to human health in their current form. However, CDC scientists cannot rule out the possibility that these viruses could eventually become capable of infecting humans. The internal genes of bat influenza viruses are compatible with human influenza viruses.",condition
cdc_0103_2,Bat Flu,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/flu-in-animals/about/bat-flu.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"That means it is possible that these viruses could exchange genetic information with human influenza viruses through a process called ""reassortment."" Reassortment occurs when two or more influenza viruses infect a single host cell, which allows the viruses to swap genetic information. Reassortment facts‎ Reassortment can sometimes lead to the emergence of new flu viruses capable of infecting humans. The conditions needed for reassortment between human influenza viruses and bat influenza viruses remain unknown. A different animal (such as pigs, horses, dogs, or seals) would need to serve as a ""bridge."" That means that another animal would need to be capable of being infected with both bat influenza virus and human influenza viruses for reassortment to occur. Since the discovery of bat flu, there has been at least one study to assess the possibility of reassortment events occurring between bat influenza and other influenza viruses. 3 So far, the results of these studies continue to indicate that bat influenza viruses are very unlikely to reassort with other influenza viruses. Preliminary laboratory research at CDC suggests that human cells do not support growth of bat influenza viruses. 1 Difference between bat influenza viruses and other influenza viruses The bat influenza viruses discovered in Central and South America are very different from other influenza viruses in humans and animals. All influenza A viruses have hemagglutinin (HA) surface proteins. Until the discovery of bat influenza viruses, there were only 16 different classes (or “subtypes”) of HA proteins known to exist in nature. The new bat influenza viruses found in Central and South America are distinct from pre-existing subtypes. CDC scientists have classified them as new subtypes, denoted as “H17” and “H18.” 1 2 The other surface protein-coding gene of bat influenza viruses, neuraminidase (NA), is different from that of known influenza viruses, as well.",condition

Impact on influenza virus evolution The discovery of bat flu has shed light on the evolution of influenza A, B, and C viruses. It is possible that many of the internal genes of bat influenza viruses are descendants of influenza virus families that once circulated more widely in previous centuries and that are now extinct, or yet to be discovered. Using a process called phylogenic analysis, comparisons between different bat influenza viruses found in Central and South America have shown that there is considerable genetic diversity between them. Some researchers concluded that in Central and South American bat populations, the bat influenza viruses may have as much genetic diversity as those found in the influenza viruses of all other mammal and bird species combined. These conclusions suggest that bat influenza viruses have been evolving in bats over a very long time, potentially centuries. 2 How bat flu was discovered The discovery of the bat influenza viruses was made possible by field work conducted by the following: CDC's Global Disease Detection (GDD) Regional Center in Guatemala, in collaboration with CDC's Pathogen Discovery Program. CDC's Rabies program. Universidad del Valle in Guatemala. A total of 316 healthy bats from 21 different species were captured from eight locations in southern Guatemala during 2009 and 2010.

Initial viral screening determined that 3 of the 316 bats tested positive for influenza. All were from a single species known as little yellow-shouldered bats.

Bites can cause itching, loss of sleep, and, rarely, allergic reactions. Prevent bed bugs by regularly looking for signs of infestation. More Information For Everyone Health Care Providers Overview Bed bugs ( Cimex species ) are small, flat insects. Bed bugs bite people and animals at night while they sleep, feeding on their blood. Bed bugs are reddish-brown in color, are wingless, and range from 1mm to 7mm in size (roughly the size of Lincoln's head on a penny). They can live several months without a blood meal. Bed bugs are not known to spread diseases to people. However, they cause irritation, itching, and loss off sleep. Removal from dwellings can be expensive and inconvenient to remove. Where you can find bed bugs You can find bed bugs anywhere, from North and South America, to Africa, Asia, and Europe. Bed bugs are in five-star hotels and resorts. How clean a place is does not determine whether bed bugs are present. Signs and symptoms Although bed bugs are not known to spread diseases to people, they can cause itching and loss of sleep. Sometimes intense itching can lead to excessive scratching and possibly a secondary skin infection. An allergic reaction to several bites is possible. If you think you are having an allergic reaction to bed bug bites, speak with your healthcare provider. How to tell if you've been bitten Bed bug bites affect each person differently. Signs of a bed bug bites include No physical signs Small bite marks Serious allergic reactions (rare). When bed bugs bite, they inject fluids (anesthetic and anticoagulant) that prevents a person from feeling the bite when it happens. Most people do not notice the bite marks until they appear from one to several days after the initial bite. Bites look similar to mosquito or flea bites—a slightly swollen and red area that may itch and be irritating.",condition

Other symptoms of bed bug bites include insomnia, anxiety, and skin problems that arise from intense scratching of the bites. Allergic reactions are possible Allergic symptoms can include enlarged bite marks, painful swellings at the bite site, and, on rare occasions, anaphylaxis. If you think you are having an allergic reaction to bed bug bites, speak with your healthcare provider. Exposure risks Everyone is at risk for getting bed bugs when visiting an infested area. However, you are at higher risk of getting bed bugs if you travel frequently and share living and sleeping space where other people have previously slept. Causes and spread Bed bugs are experts at hiding. Their slim flat bodies allow them to fit into very small spaces. They can go long periods of time without a blood meal. Bed bugs spread by getting into the seams and folds of luggage, overnight bags, folded clothes, bedding, furniture, and anywhere else they can hide. Most people do not realize they are transporting bed bugs and infecting areas as they travel. Resource‎ DPDx - Bed Bug life cycle Reducing risk Early detection and eradication of bed bugs can make infestations easier to control. For those that travel, it may be helpful to look for signs of infestation, such as exoskeletons or bed bugs in folds of mattresses and sheets, in sleeping areas. Where to look for bed bugs Bed bug infestations usually happen around or near areas where people sleep. This includes apartments, shelters, houses, hotels, cruise ships, buses, trains, and dorm rooms. The bugs hide during the day in places on or around the bed. They can hide in The seams of mattresses Box springs Bed frames and headboards Dresser tables Inside cracks or crevices Behind wallpaper Bed bugs can travel over 100 feet in a night but tend to live within 8 feet of where people sleep.",condition

However, these bite marks may take as long as 14 days to develop in some people. It's important to look for other clues to determine if you have an infestation. Look for Exoskeletons (shed after molting), Bed bugs in the fold of mattresses and sheets, Rusty–colored blood spots on mattresses or nearby furniture, and A sweet musty odor. Treatment Treating bites Bed bug bites can cause inflammatory reactions in some people, but usually do not require medical treatment. The best way to treat a bite is to apply antiseptic creams or lotions to help with itching and to avoid scratching the area (to prevent secondary infections). For people with itchy inflammatory reactions, an antihistamine may help control the itching. Treating infestations If you think you have a bed bug infestation, contact a professional pest control company experienced with treating bed bugs.

Signs and symptoms of benzene poisoning depend on how you were exposed. Get clean and get medical care if you were exposed. Background Benzene is a liquid chemical at room temperature. It either has no color or is light-yellow. It has a sweet smell and is very flammable. Benzene evaporates into the air very quickly. It is heavier than air and may sink into lower areas. Benzene dissolves only a little in water and will float on top of water. Where it is found Benzene is formed in nature and from human activities. Natural sources include volcanoes and forest fires. It is also a natural part of crude oil, gasoline, and cigarette smoke. Benzene is used often in the United States. It is in the top 20 produced chemicals by quantity. Some industries use benzene to make other chemicals that are used to make plastics, resins, and nylon and synthetic fibers. It is also used to make: Detergents Drugs Dyes Some types of lubricants Pesticides Rubbers How it works Benzene works by causing cells not to work correctly. For example, it can cause bone marrow not to produce enough red blood cells. This can lead to anemia. It can also hurt the immune system by changing blood levels of antibodies and causing the loss of white blood cells. Signs and symptoms The level of benzene poisoning depends on the amount, how someone was exposed, and for how long. It also depends on the person's age and medical conditions they may have.

This secure, cloud-based system detects and monitors health threats. Successfully onboarding health care facilities, vendors, and public health sites into the platform is vital. High-quality live data feeds power the system. These data, paired with standardized tools and processes, enable effective investigation and rapid response. Our onboarding work is an investment in a modernized public health data infrastructure. Key roles in the process Facilities transmit de-identified patient information to the BioSense Platform in near real-time. Our partners in this process who help ensure high-quality data feeds include: The facility that will submit data. In addition to the organizations that deliver care, this could also include electronic health record vendors or health information exchanges. The site , our term for the public health authority that serves as an administrative hub for groupings of facilities that transmit data. The site administrator , the primary public health authority contact at each site. Site admins will build relationships with facility staff and oversee all aspects of onboarding. Site admins serve as liaisons between facilities and NSSP. Identifying your site administrator‎ If you are associated with a facility and you're not sure who your site administrator is, contact your state or local health department. You can also reach out to NSSP by emailing nssp@cdc.gov , or create an NSSP Service Desk ticket (account access required). Onboarding job aids These resources will help site administrators walk through onboarding step-by-step, from planning to the key phases of engaging, connecting, validating and operating.

The main cause of the pneumoconioses is workplace exposure. All forms of pneumoconioses can be severe. Overview Healthy lung versus black lung. The primary pneumoconioses are: Abestosis – caused by inhaling asbestos fibers Silicosis – caused by inhaling silica dust Coal workers' pneumoconiosis (commonly referred to as CWP or black lung) caused by inhaling coal mine dust There is also a form called mixed-dust pneumoconiosis. Byssinosis, caused by exposure to cotton dust, is sometimes included with pneumoconioses. Although the pattern of lung abnormality in Byssinosis is different from the types of disease listed above. Also, many consider the term pneumoconosis as referring only to diseases caused by inhaling mineral dusts. Pneumoconiosis typically takes years to develop. However, rapidly progressive forms of silicosis can occur after short periods of intense exposure. When severe, the diseases often lead to lung impairment, disability, and premature death. Pneumoconioses can be avoided through appropriate dust control. Other forms of pneumoconiosis can be caused by inhaling dusts containing: Aluminum Antimony Barium Graphite Iron Kaolin Mica Talc Symptoms Pneumoconiosis symptoms depend on how severe the disease is. They include: Shortness of breath Coughing Increased phlegm Diagnosis Identifying and classifying pneumoconioses Lung x-ray showing pneumoconiosis in coal miner. The pneumoconioses are typically detected through radiological imaging. Severity of lung impairment can be assessed using pulmonary function tests. The International Labor Office (ILO) provides guidelines for classifying radiographs of the pneumoconioses. NIOSH operates the B Reader Program . This program allows physicians to document their proficiency in classifying radiographs (using ILO guidelines) by taking an examination.",condition

Most patients do not experience side effects from transfusions. On rare occasions, transfusions can cause adverse reactions in patients receiving blood. Although the U.S. blood supply is safer than ever, some bacteria, viruses, etc. can infect blood transfusion recipients. All blood donors and blood donations are screened for infections and diseases. Overview The U.S. blood supply is safer than it has ever been. However, blood transfusions can transmit any bloodborne pathogen. Report a Possible Outbreak ‎ To report a possible transfusion-transmitted infection cluster or outbreak. Call: 770-488-7100 E-mail: haioutbreak@cdc.gov Complications Several types of bacteria, viruses, parasites and prions can infect blood donors and recipients, though these infections are rare. Adverse reactions (e.g., allergic reaction, transfusion-transmitted infection, etc.) to a blood transfusion are also very rare. The most common adverse reactions from blood transfusions are allergic and febrile reactions, which make up over half of all adverse reactions reported. Reducing Risk Screening donated blood Healthcare providers and blood banks ask donors a set of standard questions before donating blood including: Whether or not they are in good health Their social behavior and health history If they are free of any bacterial, viral or parasitic diseases If they have traveled to areas where transmittable diseases are common If their answers indicate they are not well or are at risk for having a disease transmissible by blood transfusion, they cannot donate blood.

The U.S. healthcare system needs nearly 5,000 units of platelets and 6.500 units of plasma per day. What CDC is doing The CDC's Office of Blood, Organ and Other Tissue Safety (BOOTS) conducts surveillance for adverse events following blood transfusions. Providers can use this information to prevent transfusion-related events through evidence-based interventions and recommendations. Hospitals provide this information voluntarily. Assisting state and local health departments and hospitals in investigating reports of potential infectious disease transmission. Collecting and monitoring data on blood safety and adverse reactions in the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Hemovigilance Module since 2010.

Body lice spread by direct contact with others who have them. Symptoms include itching, rash, and bites. The only treatment is to improve hygiene and access to clean clothes. Overview Body lice are parasites, or insects, that feed on human blood. Body lice can spread disease. They live and lay eggs on clothing and bedding used by infested people. Adult body lice are small, only 2.3 – 3.6 mm in length (about the size of a sesame seed). Improved hygiene and access to regular changes of clean clothes is the only treatment needed for body lice infestations; however, in some cases pediculicides are recommended. Body lice can spread disease ( epidemic typhus , Bartonella quintana infection , and epidemic relapsing fever ). Symptoms Intense itching (pruritus) and rash caused by an allergic reaction to louse bites are common symptoms of body lice infestation. As with other lice infestations, intense itching leads to scratching which can cause sores and secondary bacterial infection of the skin. When body lice infestation lasts long, heavily bitten areas of the skin can become thickened and darkened, particularly in the mid-section of the body (waist, groin, upper thighs). Who is at risk Body lice exist worldwide but usually affect people who live in crowded conditions. They affect people without access to regular bathing and clean clothes. They can spread quickly in: People experiencing homelessness Refugees Survivors of war or natural disasters How it spreads Body lice spread through direct contact with a person who has body lice. They can also spread through contact with clothing, beds, or linens that have been in contact with a person infested with lice. However, in the United States, actual infestation with body lice tends to occur only in people who do not have access to housing, regular bathing, or clean clothes. Nits (lice eggs) take 6 – 9 days to hatch.",condition
cdc_0121_2,Body Lice,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/lice/about/body-lice.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Nits are tiny (0.8 – 0.3 mm) and hard to see; they can be confused for dandruff. Nymphs (newly hatched lice) are about the size of a pinhead and take about a week to grow into adults. Adult lice are about the size of a sesame seed, have six legs, and are tan to grayish white. Adult females can lay up to eight nits per day. Adult lice need to feed on blood several times each day; without blood meals, the louse will die within 1 – 2 days off the host. Dogs, cats, and other pets do not spread human lice. Prevention Take these steps to help prevent and control the spread of body lice: Bathe regularly and change into machine-washed clothes at least once a week. Machine wash and dry infested clothing and bedding using the hot water (at least 130°F) laundry cycle and the high heat drying cycle. Dry clean clothing and items that are not washable OR seal them in a plastic bag and store for two weeks. Do not share clothing, beds, bedding, or towels used by a person infested with body lice. You can fumigate or dust with chemical insecticides to control and prevent the spread of body lice for certain diseases (e.g., epidemic typhus). Diagnosis You can diagnose body lice infestation by finding eggs and crawling lice in the seams of clothing. Sometimes you can see a body louse crawling or feeding on the skin. Although body lice and nits can be large enough to see with the naked eye, a magnifying lens may help to find crawling lice or eggs. See a healthcare provider if you are unsure about an infestation. Treatment and recovery You can treat a body lice infestation by improving personal hygiene. Bathe and change into clean clothes at least once a week. Wash clothing, bedding, and towels used by the person infested with lice using hot water (at least 130°F) and machine dry using the hot cycle. Pediculicide, a medicine that can kill lice, is sometimes used for treatment. If prescribed a pediculicide, apply it exactly as directed on the bottle or by your healthcare provider.",condition

It is caused by a toxin that attacks the body’s nerves and causes difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis, and even death. The toxin is made by Clostridium botulinum and related bacteria. There are five main kinds of botulism. All are medical emergencies. Overview Current Infant Botulism Outbreak Learn about a current outbreak of infant botulism linked to infant formula. Botulism (""BOT-choo-liz-um"") is a rare but serious illness caused by a toxin that attacks the body's nerves. Botulism causes difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis, and even death. The toxin is made by Clostridium botulinum and sometimes Clostridium butyricum and Clostridium baratii bacteria (germs). These bacteria can produce the toxin in food, wounds, and the intestines of infants. The bacteria that make botulinum toxin are found naturally in many places, but it's rare for them to make people sick. These bacteria make spores, which act like protective coatings. Spores help the bacteria survive in the environment, even in extreme conditions. The spores usually do not cause people to become sick, even when they're eaten. But under certain conditions, these spores can grow and make one of the most lethal toxins known. The conditions in which the spores can grow and make toxin are: Low-oxygen or no oxygen (anaerobic) environment Low acid Low sugar Low salt A certain temperature range A certain amount of water For example, improperly home-canned, preserved, or fermented foods can provide the right conditions for spores to grow and make botulinum toxin. When people eat these foods, they can become seriously ill, or even die, if they don't get proper medical treatment quickly. Most common types There are 5 main kinds of botulism. Foodborne botulism Foodborne botulism can happen by eating foods that have been contaminated with botulinum toxin.",condition
cdc_0126_2,Botulism,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Common sources of foodborne botulism are homemade foods that have been improperly canned, preserved, or fermented. Though uncommon, store-bought foods also can be contaminated with botulinum toxin. Wound botulism Wound botulism can happen if the spores get into a wound and make a toxin. People who inject illicit drugs have a greater chance of getting wound botulism. People who have had a traumatic injury, such as a motorcycle crash, or surgery also can get wound botulism. Infant botulism For reasons we do not understand, some infants get botulism when the spores get into their intestines, grow, and produce the toxin. Iatrogenic botulism Iatrogenic botulism can happen if too much botulinum toxin is injected for cosmetic reasons, such as for wrinkles. It also can happen if too much of the toxin is injected for medical reasons, such as for migraine headaches. Adult intestinal toxemia Adult intestinal toxemia is also known as adult intestinal colonization. This kind of botulism is a very rare. It can happen if the spores of the bacteria get into an adult's intestines, grow, and produce the toxin (similar to infant botulism). We don't know why people get this kind of botulism. People with a serious health condition affecting the gut might be more likely to get ill. All kinds of botulism can be fatal and are medical emergencies. If you or your child has signs and symptoms of botulism , immediately see your doctor or go to the emergency room. Do not wait.

BSE caused a major outbreak in the 1980-90s, with cases reported in at least 24 countries. Most cases occurred in the United Kingdom, but many other countries also reported cases. Changes to feed policies have made BSE extremely rare. Animal health officials continue to monitor suspicious deaths in cows to watch for a potential BSE recurrence. Causes and risk BSE is caused by a prion, an infectious protein. Prions are misfolded forms of proteins normally found in the bodies of animals and people. It typically takes years for symptoms to begin after an animal is infected with a prion. Scientists believe BSE may have been caused by feeding cattle meat-and-bone meal that contained prion-infected products from cows or sheep. There is strong evidence the BSE outbreak grew and spread throughout the U.K. when such infected feed was given to young calves. Outbreaks The United Kingdom The first two cases of BSE were identified in cows in 1986 in the United Kingdom. The cows were likely infected in the 1970s. The U.K. quickly became the epicenter of the outbreak. Overall, more than 184,000 cows in the U.K. died from BSE between 1986 and 2015. The outbreak was widespread, with more than 35,000 U.K. herds affected. Cases peaked in 1993 at nearly 1,000 new cases per week. Cases deceased drastically after control measures were implemented. BSE cases are still reported occasionally but are very rare. North America The first North American BSE case was reported in 1993 in a cow imported into Canada from the UK. Rendered cohorts of this cow may have been responsible for 19 additional Canadian BSE cases beginning in 2003. In addition, animal health officials have identified 6 BSE cases in cows in the United States. One was imported from Canada and is believed to have been infected there.",condition
cdc_0128_2,Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/mad-cow/php/animal-health/index.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"The others were diagnosed with atypical BSE, which many researchers believe to be a sporadic illness not caused by contaminated feed. Other countries Outside the U.K., BSE was first reported in Ireland in 1989 and Portugal and Switzerland in 1990. By 2005, the number of countries reporting BSE among native cattle increased to 24, with the majority in Europe. Control measures Animal health officials eventually determined BSE-infected cows had eaten feed made from other cows that died from prion disease. This led to feed bans in multiple countries, which drastically reduced the number of BSE cases reported. Early efforts to control the BSE outbreak focused on culling (killing) sick animals to prevent them from entering the food chain. The UK implemented the most stringent control measure - excluding animals >30 months old from the human and animal food supplies. It also included a ban on using meat from around the animals' spinal columns since prions affect the nervous system. The programs - along with bans in other countries - have prevented additional BSE outbreaks. Occasional cases still occur, but they are very rare. Risk to people Strong evidence exists that consuming meat from BSE-infected cows causes variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in people. vCJD cases began in the U.K. about 10 years after BSE-contaminated beef likely made its way for an extended period into food produced for people. This is consistent with the time between when someone is exposed to a prion disease and when they develop one themselves. As BSE has been largely eradicated, it is not thought to pose much risk to people currently.

Signs and symptoms of bromine poisoning depend on how you were exposed. Get clean and get medical care if you were exposed. Background Bromine is a naturally occurring element that is a liquid at room temperature. It has a brownish-red color and smells like bleach. It dissolves in water. Where it is found Bromine is found naturally in the earth's crust and in seawater. Bromine can also be found as another option to chlorine in swimming pools. Products with bromine are used in agriculture, sanitation and as fire retardants (chemicals that help prevent things from catching fire). Some bromine-containing products were historically used as sedatives (drugs that can make people calm or sleepy). However, these drugs are for the most part no longer found on the market in the United States. How it works Bromine can irritate the skin and tissues, including the tissues that make mucus in your mouth and nose. Signs and symptoms The level of bromine poisoning depends on the amount, how someone was exposed, and for how long. It also depends on the person's age and medical conditions they may have. Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to bromine. If breathed in: Cough Trouble breathing Headache Irritation of your mucous membranes (inside your mouth, nose, etc.) Dizziness Watery eyes If exposed to skin: Skin irritation and burns Cooling sensation closely followed by a burning feeling If swallowed in large amounts: Nausea Vomiting Swallowing compounds (combinations of bromine with other chemicals) with bromine causes different effects depending on the compound.

Your doctor will decide which antibiotics you'll get for a minimum of 6-8 weeks. To be sure you get the right medicines for you, let your healthcare providers know if you are: Pregnant Allergic to doxycycline or rifampin Are immunosuppressed from medical conditions or other medicines Brucella RB51 treatment If you have with an infection from a strain of Brucella called RB51 from consuming infected animal products, you'll need antibiotics other than rifampin. This particular strain of Brucella is resistant to it, meaning rifampin will not treat the infection. It's important that you take all your medicines when being treated for brucellosis. If you're not properly treated, the infection can become chronic and lead to long-term disease associated with arthritis, endocarditis, chronic fatigue, depression, and swelling of the liver or spleen. Depending on the timing of treatment and how sick you are, recovery may take a few weeks to several months. Death from brucellosis is rare and only happens in less than 2% of cases.

cdc_0134_1,Bullying,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/youth-violence/about/about-bullying.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Bullying Oct. 28, 2024 Key points Bullying is a type of violence experienced by youth and it can happen in person and through technology. Bullying is widespread in the United States and causes harm to youth. Preventing bullying involves teaching kids safe ways to stand up against it and enhancing their interpersonal skills, like empathy and conflict management. What is bullying? CDC defines bullying as any unwanted aggressive behavior(s) by another youth or group of youths, who are not siblings or current dating partners. It involves an observed or perceived power imbalance, and is repeated multiple times or is highly likely to be repeated. Bullying may inflict harm or distress on the victim including physical, psychological, social, or educational harm. 1 Common types of bullying include: Physical such as hitting, kicking, and tripping. Verbal including name-calling and teasing. Relational or social such as spreading rumors and leaving out of the group. Damage to victim's property. Bullying can also occur through technology, called electronic bullying or cyberbullying. 1 A young person can be a perpetrator, a victim, or both (also known as a ""bully/victim""). Quick facts and stats Bullying is an adverse childhood experience that is widespread in the United States. Bullying harms all youth involved including those who are bullied, those who bully others, and bystanders who witness it. Bullying is common. About one in five high school students reported being bullied on school property in the past year. More than one in six high school students reported being bullied electronically in the past year including through texting and social media. 2 Some youth experience bullying more than others. Female students were more likely than male students to experience bullying, both on school property and electronically.",condition
cdc_0134_2,Bullying,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/youth-violence/about/about-bullying.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Additionally, Asian students and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander students were less likely than Hispanic, White, and Multiracial students to be bullied at school. Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander students were less likely than students from most other racial and ethnic groups to be electronically bullied. 2 Bullying is a frequent discipline problem. A national survey found that 28% of middle schools, 15% of high schools, and 10% of elementary schools reported the occurrence of bullying at school at least once a week. About 37% of middle schools reported the occurrence of cyberbullying at least once a week, followed by 25% of high schools and 6% of elementary schools. 3 Warning signs Not all children who are bullied show warning signs, but StopBullying.gov suggests being aware of these common signs: Unexplained injuries. Lost or destroyed clothing, books, electronics, or jewelry. Frequent headaches or stomachaches, feeling sick, or faking illness. Difficulty sleeping or frequent nightmares. Declining grades, loss of interest in schoolwork, or not wanting to go to school. Outcomes Bullying can result in physical injury, social and emotional distress, self-harm, and even death. It also increases the risk for depression, anxiety, sleep difficulties, lower academic achievement, and dropping out of school. Youth who bully others are at increased risk for substance misuse, academic problems, and experiencing violence later in adolescence and adulthood. 4 Youth who bully others and are bullied themselves suffer the most serious consequences and are at greater risk for mental health and behavioral problems. Prevention We all have a role to play in preventing bullying. Youth and adults play important roles in preventing violence and creating safe communities where young people can thrive. A bystander (someone who witnesses bullying, either in person or online) can make a positive impact by becoming an upstander.",condition

CASPER is quick, relatively inexpensive, flexible, and uses a simple reporting format. It uses a valid sampling methodology to collect information at the household level. About CASPER is a type of rapid needs assessment (RNA) that provides household-level information to public health leaders and emergency managers. CASPER can provide accurate and timely data for decision makers through precise analysis and interpretation. CASPER is a cross-sectional epidemiologic design; it is not surveillance. Information from CASPERs can help public health and emergency managers: Initiate public health action Identify information gaps Facilitate disaster planning, response, and recovery activities Allocate resources Collect and assess new or changing needs in the community Interactive Map of CASPERs See the interactive map for examples of how CASPER has been used throughout the United States since 2001. The CASPER methodology is an adaptation of epidemiologic techniques used by scientists in the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) who estimate vaccine coverage in Africa. CASPER's cluster sampling design involves two stages. The first stage includes 30 clusters selected probability proportional to size. The second stage includes seven households interviewed within each cluster. This design provides estimates for the population. There may be situations in which this design is not feasible or ideal. Modifications are acceptable. For additional information, read the CASPER Overview fact sheet . There are many opportunities for CASPERs to influence public health. A CASPER can be used in both a disaster and non-disaster setting.",condition
cdc_0135_2,CASPER,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/casper/php/overview/index.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"For example, CASPER methodology has been used to do the following: Analyze public health perceptions Estimate needs of a community Assist in planning for emergency response Benefits of CASPER Information is key for decision-making. Information sent to the right people, at the right place, at the right time, is optimal for any successful response. CASPER addresses this by providing valid information rapidly about the general and health needs of a community to decision-makers. CASPER is generalizable (providing population estimates), timely, relatively low cost, reported in a simple format, and flexible. CASPER was originally designed to provide information during a disaster response. It can also be used when population-representative data are needed during other disaster phases (preparedness, recovery, mitigation). Additionally, it can be used in situations unrelated to a disaster. For example, public health departments have used CASPER to: Identify household-level information about community health status Learn more about emerging infectious diseases, such as Zika virus and H1N1 Assess community awareness/opinions/concerns on subjects such as the following: Climate change Opioid use Healthy homes Radiation emergency preparedness Goals The primary goals of the CASPER are to rapidly obtain information about the needs of an affected community and to assess changes in needs during the response or recovery period. CASPER also produces household-based population estimates of needs for decision makers. Examples of CASPER objectives include the following: Determine the critical health needs Assess the impact of a disaster on the community Characterize the population residing in the area including any ongoing health effects Evaluate the effectiveness of recovery efforts using a follow-up CASPER CASPER is not intended to deliver food, medicine, medical services or other resources to the affected area or to provide direct services to residents such as cleanup or home repair.",condition

CDC’s National Center for Environmental Health developed the CASPER Toolkit to outline and standardize the assessment methodology. CDC coined the term CASPER to distinguish it from other rapid needs assessments. The CASPER toolkit provides guidelines to assist personnel from any federal, state, tribal, local, or territorial (STLT) public health department or other emergency response agencies in conducting CASPER. The toolkit is focused on United States disaster response. However, it may also be adapted for use in a non-disaster or international setting. The toolkit provides a standardized, step-by-step guide for conducting a CASPER, including: Preparing a checklist Questionnaire development Sample selection Training Data collection Analysis Report writing Templates and examples Public health personnel, emergency management officials, academics, or others who wish to assess household-level public health needs will find the toolkit useful for rapid data collection for actionable decision-making during disaster or non-emergency situations.",condition

Remember, a CASPER will be descriptive of the entire sampling frame (geographic area from which your sample is drawn). It will not provide detailed information on subpopulations or specific groups. For example, if you want to determine the needs or status of pregnant women or persons experiencing homelessness, you should not conduct a CASPER. CASPER phases There are four phases in a CASPER: prepare for the CASPER; conduct the CASPER in the field; analyze the data; and write the report. Phase 1: Prepare for CASPER Checklist to prepare for CASPER. As you prepare to conduct a CASPER, there are many planning questions that should be addressed. Work with leadership, key partners, and CASPER subject matter experts (SMEs) within your state or CDC to help plan and prepare. Keep in mind that preparing for a CASPER can take several hours (e.g., during a response) or, if time allows, several months (e.g., in a non-disaster setting). Keep Reading: Prepare for CASPER Phase 2: Conduct the CASPER in the field Group of volunteers CASPER is conducted through face-to-face interviews in the field. There are several advantages to conducting face-to-face interviews. These include a high response rate and the ability to distribute health information or other materials to the community. Face-to-face interviews have the additional benefit of directly connecting the community to local staff, increasing the visibility of and trust in the health department.",condition

Healthcare providers should check for signs and symptoms of TBI if an older adult has: Fallen or has a fall-related injury, such as a hip fracture. Been in a car crash. This is especially important among older adults who are taking blood thinners, 11 such as: Anticoagulants like warfarin (Coumadin), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and apixaban (Eliquis). Antiplatelet medications like clopidogrel (Plavix), ticagrelor (Brilinta), and acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin). These medicines may increase the risk for bleeding in the brain following a TBI. 11 Bleeding in the brain after a TBI may put a person at risk for more severe injury or death. Potential effects of TBIs A TBI may lead to short- or long-term health problems Depending on the severity of the injury, those who get a TBI may face health problems that last a few days or the rest of their lives. For example, a person with a mild TBI or concussion may experience short-term symptoms and feel better within a couple of weeks or months. And a person with a moderate or severe TBI may have long-term or life-long effects from the injury. A person with a possible TBI should be seen by a healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider may have treatment to help speed your recovery. Most people with a mild TBI or concussion can recover safely at home following a medical check-up.

Not all unusual patterns of cancer are cancer clusters. Contact your state, tribal, local, or territorial health department or cancer registry if you think your community is experiencing more cancer than usual. Overview Cancer is a group of diseases in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. As a group, cancers are very common. Given the frequency with which cancers are diagnosed, sometimes situations arise where an unusual number of cancers are diagnosed among people in a particular location. These unusual numbers may be from chance, or they may result from the following: Different cancer screening practices Different access to health care, which may reflect other social and economic factors Genetic susceptibility to a particular cancer Behavioral risks and social determinants of health Occupational exposures Environmental exposures Many causes of cancer are unknown. However, some environmental exposures have been shown to be related to the development of cancer in specific organs. For example, if you are exposed to asbestos , you could develop mesothelioma . Definitions Some unusual patterns of cancer are considered a cancer cluster . A cancer cluster is defined as a greater than expected number of the same or etiologically related cancer cases that occurs within a group of people in a geographic area over a defined period of time. Etiology refers to causes and risk factors associated with the development of disease. For example, exposure to the sun can cause skin cancer. The definition of a cancer cluster can be further explained as follows: A greater than expected number When the number of observed cases is greater than typically observed in a similar setting.",condition
cdc_0153_2,Cancer Clusters,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/cancer-environment/about/,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Of the same or e tiologically related cancer cases Cases are of the same type, are within a family of tumors (for example Ewing's family of tumors ) or have a known or suggested link to the same specific environmental or chemical exposures. It is possible to consider multiple cancer types when such a known exposure (for example, radiation or a specific chemical) is linked to more than one cancer type or when more than one contaminant or exposure type has been identified. Within a group of people The population in which the cancer cases are occurring is defined by its demographic factors (for example, race/ethnicity, age, and sex). In a geographic area The geographic area may be based upon pre-existing geopolitical boundaries (for example, census tract, county, or ZIP code/ZIP code tabulation area). It may be defined according to the nature and extent of potential exposures that may cross multiple or partial boundaries. For example, air pollution from a hazardous waste incinerator which may cross multiple counties or census tracts. These geographic boundaries are used to determine the number of cancer cases as they relate to the total population in this predefined area. It is possible to create or obscure a cluster inadvertently by modifying the area of interest. Over a defined period of time The time frame used to establish the beginning and end dates for analysis. The time period chosen for analysis will affect both the total cases observed and the calculation of the expected incidence of cancer in the population.

For information about cancer in the workplace, please see the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health website. Examining unusual patterns of cancer State, tribal, local, and territorial health departments, along with cancer registries, respond to questions about unusual patterns of cancer. Usually, health departments start by gathering information about the unusual pattern of cancer, including the expected cancer rate, types of cancer, number of cases, and the age, sex, race, address, occupation, and age at diagnosis of the people with cancer. CDC/ATSDR has created a decision-making tool that can be used by health departments for determining the need to further assess an unusual pattern of cancer. The tool contains a set of criteria that can be used to assess the cancer(s) of concern and/or related environmental risk factors. These criteria promote further assessment of unusual patterns of cancer. Reducing your risk of developing cancer In general, cancers have a variety of risk factors related to behavioral, lifestyle, occupational, and environmental risks. For many cancers, you can reduce your risk of developing cancer by adopting a healthy lifestyle that includes avoiding tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, and sun exposure; increasing physical activity; maintaining a recommended body weight; and eating a healthy and nutritious diet.

It is caused by specific type A influenza viruses known to infect, cause illness, and spread in dogs. In general, canine influenza viruses are thought to pose a low threat to people. Signs and symptoms Canine influenza, also known as dog flu, is currently caused by an influenza A(H3N2) virus that spreads in dogs. Dog flu likely poses a low threat to people. Canine influenza A(H3N2) viruses are different from seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses that commonly spread among people. To date, there is no evidence of spread of canine influenza viruses from dogs to people. There has not been a single reported case of human infection with a canine influenza virus anywhere in the world. In 2016, CDC used the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool to evaluate the potential risk of canine influenza A(H3N2) viruses causing a pandemic and found it to be low. Evolving viruses Influenza viruses are constantly changing. It is possible that a canine influenza A virus could change to gain the ability to infect and spread easily between people. Humans have little immunity against new, non-human (novel) influenza A viruses. Infections in people with novel influenza A viruses are concerning when they occur. If these viruses acquire the ability to spread easily among people, it could result in a pandemic. For this reason, the World Health Organization conducts global flu surveillance, which has led to detection of novel influenza A virus infections in humans. Surveillance focuses on novel influenza A viruses of animal origin (such as avian or swine influenza A viruses). Signs of Illness in Dogs The signs of this illness in dogs include: cough, runny nose, fever, lethary, eye discharge, and reduced appetite. However, not all dogs will show signs of illness.",condition
cdc_0157_2,Canine Flu,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/flu-in-animals/about/canine-flu.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"The severity of illness associated with canine flu in dogs can range from no signs to severe illness resulting in pneumonia and sometimes death. Most dogs recover from dog flu within 2 to 3 weeks. However, some dogs may develop secondary bacterial infections, which can lead to more severe illness and pneumonia. Anyone who has concerns about their pet's health, or whose pet is showing signs of dog flu, should contact their veterinarian. Testing is available to confirm canine influenza A(H3N2) virus infection in dogs. Your veterinarian can tell you if testing is appropriate. Understanding risk H3N2 canine influenza viruses are not endemic in dogs in the United States but multiple, localized outbreaks with regional die-outs continue to occur, seeded by repeated re-introductions from Asia. H3N8 canine influenza viruses have not been reported since 2016 and do not appear to be actively circulating anymore. If evidence emerges that canine influenza viruses can infect people with the potential for sustained human-to-human spread, CDC has a plan in place. CDC will execute its existing authorities to limit the introduction and/or spread of that pandemic virus into or within the United States. CDC regulations require that dogs be healthy to enter the United States. Dogs may be denied entry or further evaluated if they look like they could be sick with a communicable disease. For dogs that appear sick or are dead upon arrival in the United States, CDC can require a veterinary examination or a necropsy (animal autopsy) at the owner's expense. Multiple agencies may have regulatory authority over pets such as dogs and cats when entering the United States. The United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Veterinary Services has animal health requirements related to bringing a pet dog to the United States from a foreign country.

Dog flu is thought to spread mainly through respiratory droplets produced when infected dogs cough or sneeze. It can also spread through contact with contaminated surfaces. What CDC is doing about dog flu‎ Current CDC influenza virus regulations apply only to viruses with pandemic potential in people. However, CDC is doing a number of things to be prepared in the unlikely event that dog flu becomes a threat to humans or to animals other than dogs. CDC continues to conduct year-round surveillance for seasonal and novel influenza A viruses. All human infections with novel influenza A viruses are fully investigated. Human infections with a novel influenza A virus of animal origin are reportable to CDC. CDC has existing collaborative protocols with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services to work together in the event of outbreaks of novel influenza A viruses. These same protocols would be followed in the event of an outbreak of dog flu among people. Third, CDC conducted a risk assessment on the pandemic potential of H3N2 canine influenza viruses using the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool. The assessment found the pandemic risk posed by canine influenza viruses to be low. Prevention Vaccines to protect dogs against H3N2 dog flu are available in the United States. Your veterinarian can provide additional information about these vaccines and whether you should consider vaccinating your dog. Dog owners whose dogs are coughing or showing other signs of respiratory disease should not expose their dog to other dogs or to cats. After exposure to dogs showing signs of respiratory disease, people should clean and disinfect clothing, equipment, surfaces, and hands.

In 2004, cases of an unknown respiratory illness in dogs were reported in the United States. An investigation showed that this respiratory illness was caused by equine influenza viruses. Scientists believe that after jumping from horses to dogs, the virus adapted to cause illness in dogs and spread among them. It spreads especially quickly among dogs housed in kennels and shelters. This is now considered a dog-specific (canine) H3N8 virus. In September 2005, this virus was identified by experts as a ""newly emerging pathogen in the dog population"" in the United States. H3N8 canine influenza viruses have not been reported since 2016 and do not appear to be actively circulating anymore. Origins of H3N2 Canine Influenza Canine influenza H3N2 viruses originated in birds and spread to dogs . The first H3N2 canine influenza viruses were reported in 2004. There has also been reported spread of H3N2 canine influenza viruses from dogs to cats. H3N2 canine influenza viruses were first detected in dogs in South Korea in 2007. These viruses have also been reported in dogs in China, Thailand, and Canada. H3N2 canine influenza viruses were first detected in the United States in April 2015 . They have now been found in multiple U.S. states and regions. To date, the H3N2 canine viruses reported in the United States have been almost identical genetically to those previously reported in Asia. Treatment Treatment for dog flu largely consists of supportive care. In milder cases, supportive care may include medication to make your dog more comfortable and fluids to ensure that your dog remains well hydrated. This helps to keep the dog comfortable and hydrated while its body mounts an immune response.

Cannabis can be used in a number of ways. How cannabis affects a person depends on several factors. What we know about cannabis Cannabis, which can also be called marijuana, weed, pot, or bud, refers to the dried flowers, leaves, stems, and seeds of the cannabis plant. The cannabis plant contains more than 100 compounds (or cannabinoids). These compounds include tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is impairing or mind-altering, as well as other active compounds, such as cannabidiol (CBD). CBD – by itself - is not impairing, meaning it does not cause a ""high"". 1 Types Cannabis can be used in a number of ways. The most common ways include: 2 3 Smoked in joints (like a cigarette), in blunts (cigars or cigar wrappers that have been partly or completely refilled with cannabis) or in bongs (pipes or water pipes) Vaped using electronic vaporizing devices (like vape pens) or other vaporizers Mixed or infused into foods or drinks (called edibles) like cookies, cakes, or brownies, or tea, cola, or alcohol Additionally, some people inhale the oil concentrates and other extracts from the cannabis plant—this is known as dabbing.

Find quick facts about CO poisoning and what can be done to prevent it. What it is Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless gas that kills without warning. It claims the lives of hundreds of people every year and makes thousands more ill. Many household items including gas- and oil-burning furnaces, portable generators, and charcoal grills produce this poison gas. Symptoms The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness, upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. CO symptoms are often described as “flu-like.” If you breathe in a lot of CO, it can make you pass out or kill you. People who are sleeping, drunk, or under the influence of other substances can die from CO poisoning before they have symptoms. Risk factors Everyone is at risk for CO poisoning. Infants, the elderly, and people with chronic heart disease, anemia, or breathing problems are more likely to get sick from CO. Each year, more than 400 Americans die from unintentional CO poisoning not linked to fires, more than 100,000 visit an emergency department, and more than 14,000 are hospitalized. Reducing risk CO is found in fumes produced any time you burn fuel in cars or trucks, small engines, stoves, lanterns, grills, fireplaces, gas ranges, or furnaces. CO can build up indoors and poison people and animals who breathe it. However, you can reduce your risk of CO poisoning with a few small steps. CO detectors Replace your CO detector following manufacturer instructions Install battery-operated or battery back-up CO detectors near every sleeping area in your home. Check CO detector batteries when you change the time on your clocks each spring and fall to be sure they are functioning properly. Consider buying a detector with a digital readout.",condition

Replace your CO detector following the manufacturer's instructions or every 5 years. Set a reminder on your smartphone or other device calendar when you purchase and install the detector. Oil and gas furnaces and other household appliances Have your heating system serviced annually Have your heating system, water heater, and any other gas, oil, or coal burning appliances serviced by a qualified technician every year. Make sure your gas appliances are vented properly. Horizontal vent pipes for appliances, such as a water heater, should go up slightly as they go toward outdoors, as shown below. This prevents CO from leaking if the joints or pipes aren't fitted tightly. When you buy gas equipment, buy only equipment carrying the seal of a national testing agency, such as Underwriters' Laboratories. If you smell an odor from your gas refrigerator, have an expert service it. An odor from your gas refrigerator can mean it could be leaking CO. Never heat your house with a gas oven. Don't cook or burn anything on a stove or fireplace that isn't vented. Horizontal vent pipes for appliances, such as a water heater, should go up slightly as they go toward outdoors Chimneys, charcoal, and portable appliances Have your chimney checked or cleaned every year. Chimneys can be blocked by debris, which can cause CO to build up inside your home or cabin. Never burn charcoal indoors. Burning charcoal - red, gray, black, or white - gives off CO. Never use a portable gas camp stove indoors. Do not use portable flameless chemical heaters indoors. Portable generators Download Operate your generator outdoors more than 20 feet from windows, doors, and vents to avoid CO poisoning Never use a generator inside your home or garage, even if doors and windows are open.

Cardiomyopathy can be acquired—developed because of another disease, condition, or factor—or inherited. What it is Cardiomyopathy represents a collection of diverse conditions of the heart muscle. These diseases have many causes, symptoms, and treatments and can affect people of all ages and races. When cardiomyopathy occurs, the normal muscle in the heart can thicken, stiffen, thin out, or fill with substances the body produces that do not belong in the heart muscle. As a result, the heart muscle's ability to pump blood is reduced. This, in turn, can lead to irregular heartbeats, the backup of blood into the lungs or rest of the body, and heart failure. Cardiomyopathy can be acquired—developed because of another disease, condition, or factor—or inherited. The cause isn't always known. The main types of cardiomyopathy include the following: 1 2 3 4 Dilated: meaning that one of the pumping chambers (ventricles) of the heart is enlarged. This is more common in males and is the most common form of cardiomyopathy in children. It can occur at any age and may or may not be inherited. Hypertrophic: where the heart muscle is thickened. This often presents in childhood or early adulthood and can cause sudden death in adolescents and young adult athletes. 1 It is often an inherited condition, and a person may not have any symptoms. If there is a family history of this, other family members can be tested and adjust their activities to reduce the risk of sudden death.

A genetic counselor or healthcare provider can help determine which family members should be tested first. Overview Many people do not know they have a genetic condition until symptoms of that condition begin to affect their lives. By then, treatments might be less likely to work. Cascade testing offers one way of finding people with genetic conditions before they show symptoms, allowing them to take steps to prevent disease or treat it early. How it works If you have been diagnosed with a genetic condition, your family members are more likely to have it, too. Sharing your diagnosis with your family members allows them to learn more and be checked for the condition. Finding and treating a genetic condition early can lead to better health. Family members who are most likely to have the same genetic change, or mutation, are tested first. From there, genetic testing ""cascades"" through the family depending on who has the genetic change and who does not. For example, if genetic testing shows that your mother has the same genetic change that you have, family members on your mother's side would be tested. Your father's side would not need to be tested. How to share your diagnosis with your family members The first step in cascade testing is to let your family members know about your diagnosis and genetic test results. Here are some tips to get started: Gather information to share with your family members. This may include the following: Your diagnosis Your genetic test report(s): Providing a copy of your genetic test report for your family members to take to a genetic counselor may help your family members receive testing quicker.",condition

Determine which family members should be tested first. A genetic counselor or medical provider can help you with this. Your children, sisters, brothers, and parents are most likely to have the same genetic condition. Testing should start with them, with the limitation that genetic testing for adult-onset conditions is not generally done in children. If a family member is not available for testing (for example, the family member does not want to be tested or has died), then moving to more distant family members is appropriate. Decide how you would like to share the information with your family members. Below are some options: Talk to your family members directly. Your genetic counselor can help you plan how to tell your family members, including what information is most important. Write a letter explaining your diagnosis, including any related genetic testing and lab results.

Why it matters CAUTIs are one of the most common HAIs. About 75% of UTIs developed in hospitals are associated with a urinary catheter. 15-25% of hospitalized patients receive urinary catheters during their hospital stay. CAUTIs are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, healthcare costs and length of stay. They are preventable. Background A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection that involves any of the organs or structures of the urinary tract, (e.g., kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra). A CAUTI occurs when germs (usually bacteria) enter the urinary tract through the urinary catheter and cause infection. Recommendations All healthcare facilities Only use urinary catheters when needed. Place catheters using proper germ-free techniques with sterile equipment. Maintain the catheter's closed sterile drainage system. Remove catheters as soon as patients no longer need them. Prolonged use is the most important risk factor for CAUTIs. Healthcare facilities should follow the 2009 CDC Guideline for Prevention of Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infections . The guideline emphasizes the proper use, insertion, and maintenance of urinary catheters in different healthcare settings. It also presents effective quality improvement programs that healthcare facilities can use to prevent CAUTIs.

CLABSIs are preventable. Overview Importance Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) result in thousands of deaths each year and billions of dollars in added costs to the U.S. healthcare system – but they are preventable. Central lines A central line (also known as a central venous catheter) is a catheter (tube) that healthcare providers often place in a large vein in the neck, chest or groin. Central lines are different from peripheral IVs (shorter IVs placed in the hand, arm or foot for vein access); central lines access a major vein close to the heart, can remain in place for weeks or months, and are much more likely to be a source of serious infection. Central lines are commonly used in intensive care units. Purpose of central lines Give medicines for treatment of pain, infection or other medical issues (e.g., cancer or heart problems). Provide fluids or nutrition. Help conduct certain medical tests. Types Types of central lines Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) . Placed into a vein in the arm. Tunneled catheter. Passed under the skin and placed into a vein in the chest or neck. Providers can insert medicine right into the catheter. Implanted port. Surgically placed under the skin. Providers insert medicines using a needle placed through the skin into the catheter. An implanted port is not as visible as a tunneled catheter, does not require as much daily care, and does not get in the way of a patient's regular activities as much as a PICC line or a tunneled catheter might.

Chapare is deadly; about 60% of people with the disease die. There is no specific treatment for Chapare. A limited number of Chapare outbreaks have been reported, all in Bolivia. What it is Chapare hemorrhagic fever (Chapare) is an illness caused by infection with the Chapare virus. This virus can spread to people through contact with the saliva, urine, and droppings of infected rodents. Chapare virus has caused a small number of documented outbreaks, all in Bolivia. All outbreaks have been limited in scale, with no evidence of sustained community transmission. The first outbreak consisted of one fatal case reported in 2003 in Chapare Province. In 2019, the virus reemerged in Caranavi, where nine cases were reported with four deaths. Health authorities confirmed some of these cases were from person-to-person transmission among healthcare workers. In 2025, two separate cases were detected in La Paz Department. Because Chapare can cause severe disease and because it can potentially spread in healthcare facilities, Chapare remains a public health concern. Healthcare providers: Review guidance on emergency services, screening, testing, infection control and PPE for viral hemorrhagic fevers like Chapare. Signs and symptoms Chapare symptoms are like those of other South American hemorrhagic fevers, such as Argentine hemorrhagic fever or Bolivian hemorrhagic fever. Due to the low number of reported Chapare cases, there is limited information about the disease. Documented signs and symptoms of Chapare include: Fever Headache Joint and muscle pain Pain behind the eyes Stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea Bleeding gums Rash Irritability Evidence suggests that pregnant women who are infected with Chapare virus may have complications, including miscarriage or death of the mother or newborn.",condition

However, other similar viruses are known to infect the fetus when it is in the uterus. Prevention Chapare virus has not been detected outside of Bolivia. If you are in an area of Bolivia where the virus has been detected: Avoid areas that are infested with rodents and other small mammals. Avoid areas where you see signs of rodent infestation like droppings. Avoid contact with the body fluids of people who are sick with Chapare. Healthcare providers should use standard contact and droplet precautions with eye protection while managing suspected or confirmed Chapare cases. They should use airborne precautions when performing procedures that could cause the virus to spray into the air. Keep Reading Prevent rodent infestations Testing and Diagnosis Healthcare providers can diagnose Chapare with blood tests that detect the virus, like polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There are currently no antibody tests that can tell if someone had the virus in the past. Clinicians should notify their state or local health department if a patient has recently been in an area with Chapare virus and has compatible symptoms. Treatment and recovery There is currently no specific treatment for Chapare. Supportive therapy can help people recover from and survive. This includes: Providing fluids and electrolytes (body salts) Using medication to support blood pressure, reduce vomiting and diarrhea, and manage fever and pain Treating other infections, if they occur Even months after symptoms stop, people who recover from Chapare may continue to shed the virus in their blood, saliva, urine, or semen.",condition

Overview Roughly every 8 minutes, call data from poison centers across the country are uploaded to a national reporting database and electronic surveillance system called the National Poison Data System (NPDS). CDC and America's Poison Centers use the database to improve surveillance of chemical exposures and public health hazards. How it works Scientists from CDC and America's Poison Centers monitor NPDS every day. They watch for any data anomalies that may represent incidents of public health significance such as outbreaks of illness. Anomalies can include an increase in the number of calls or an increase in reports of specific signs and symptoms.

After a disaster, there may be power outages. This can result in people using alternative sources of fuel or electricity for heating, cooling, or cooking. These sources can lead to elevated CO levels in enclosed spaces, poisoning people and animals inside. CDC uses NPDS for surveillance during disaster response and recovery efforts to track reported exposures to CO. Using these data can help inform public health messaging to prevent further injury and death. Identifying an increase in exposures to cleaners and disinfectants (2020) In April 2020, CDC published a report that described an increase in calls to poison centers about exposures to cleaners and disinfectants. Using data from NPDS, CDC and America's Poison Centers found that poison centers nationwide received 45,550 calls regarding exposures to cleaners and disinfectants during the first three months of 2020-an increase of about 20% from the same timeframe in 2019. The timing of these reported exposures corresponded to increased media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic, reports of consumer shortages of cleaning and disinfection products, and the beginning of some local and state stay-at-home orders. The results of this study highlighted the importance of safe and appropriate use of cleaners and disinfectants to prevent potential poisonings and injuries. Identifying sources of harmful algal and cyanobacterial bloom exposures (2019) Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are the rapid growth of algae or cyanobacteria that can cause harm to people, animals, and the environment. In 2019, CDC and America’s Poison Centers worked with five poison centers to conduct follow-up surveys with people who had called regarding a HAB exposure. Fifty-five people were interviewed.",condition

The most frequently reported source of exposure was bathing or swimming in contaminated water. Few callers had heard or read warnings about the dangers of HABs before or during their exposure. This study highlights the importance of characterizing exposures to HABs to tailor public health messaging. Increasing awareness of synthetic cannabinoids (2015) CDC launched an investigation in April 2015 after being alerted to an increase in poison center calls related to synthetic cannabinoids, also known as synthetic marijuana. The results, published in MMWR , led to a surge in media coverage on this issue that created a broader awareness of issues and dangers of using synthetic cannabinoids. Reporting poisoning from electronic cigarettes (2014) Electronic cigarettes, or e-cigarettes, are devices that heat a liquid mixture to allow users to inhale an aerosol that typically contains nicotine, flavorings, and other additives. While long-term impacts of these products on public health are unknown, one area of concern is the potential for poisonings. A CDC study found that 2,405 e-cigarette exposures were reported to poison centers from September 2010 to February 2014. This work informed public health actions including the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act of 2015, enacted in January 2016. This law requires any container of liquid nicotine that is sold, manufactured, distributed, or imported into the United States use packaging that is difficult for children under 5 years of age to open. Improving consumer safety for laundry pods (2012) From May 17–June 17, 2012, poison centers across the country reported 485 cases of children being exposed to detergent-filled laundry pods.

Tracking concerns during Japan radiological event (2011) CDC tracked all calls to poison centers related to the 2011 Japan nuclear event. Between March 11 and April 18, NPDS tracked 340 information requests and 64 calls regarding potential radiation, potassium iodide and iodide product exposures. Call details were analyzed daily for situational awareness and to inform public health response efforts. Staff from CDC and America’s Poison Centers performed detailed follow up and data review to confirm exposure status. Surveillance for calls related to potassium iodide (a medication used to prevent the uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid) exposures documented adverse outcomes in persons taking this product in response to a perceived risk from this event.

People who have never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine should get 2 doses. Most people who get the vaccine will be protected for life and not get chickenpox. Introduction The best way to protect against chickenpox is to get the chickenpox vaccine. The chickenpox vaccine prevents almost all cases of severe illness. Instead of MMRV, some children might receive separate vaccines for MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) and varicella (chickenpox). If a vaccinated person does get chickenpox, called breakthrough chickenpox, the symptoms are usually mild. Vaccinated people often experience fewer to no blisters and low or no fever, but red spots may occur.

Child abuse and neglect can have long-term impacts on health, opportunity, and well-being. What are child abuse and neglect? Child abuse and neglect includes all types of abuse and neglect of a child under the age of 18 by a parent, caregiver, or another person in a custodial role (e.g., a religious leader, a coach, or a teacher) that results in harm, the potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child. There are four common types of abuse and neglect: Physical abuse is the intentional use of physical force that can result in physical injury. Examples include hitting, kicking, shaking, or other shows of force against a child. Sexual abuse refers to any completed or attempted sexual acts or sexual contact with a child by a caregiver. Examples include fondling, penetration, and exposing a child to other sexual activities. Read more information about child sexual abuse . Emotional abuse refers to behaviors that harm a child's self-worth or emotional well-being. Examples include name-calling, shaming, rejecting, and withholding love. Neglect is the failure to meet a child's basic physical and emotional needs. These needs include housing, food, clothing, education, access to medical care, and having feelings validated and appropriately responded to. 1 For more information about child abuse and neglect definitions please see Child Maltreatment Surveillance: Uniform Definitions for Public Health and Recommended Data Elements [4.12 MB, 148 Pages, 508] . Quick facts and stats Child abuse and neglect are common. At least one in seven children experienced child abuse or neglect in the past year in the United States. 2 This is likely an underestimate because many cases are unreported.

Rates of child abuse and neglect are five times higher for children in families with low socioeconomic status compared to families with a higher socioeconomic status. Child maltreatment is costly. In the United States, the total lifetime economic burden associated with child abuse and neglect was about $592 billion in 2018. 4 This economic burden rivals the cost of other high-profile public health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes. 5 Outcomes Children who are abused or neglected may suffer immediate physical injuries such as cuts, bruises, or broken bones. They may also have emotional and psychological problems, such as anxiety or posttraumatic stress. Over the long term, children who are abused or neglected are also at increased risk for experiencing future violence victimization and perpetration, substance abuse, sexually transmitted infections, delayed brain development, lower educational attainment, and limited employment opportunities. Abuse and neglect may result in toxic stress, which can change brain development and increase the risk for problems like posttraumatic stress disorder and learning, attention, and memory difficulties. 6 Prevention Child abuse and neglect can be prevented. Certain factors may increase or decrease the risk of perpetrating or experiencing child abuse and neglect. Preventing child abuse and neglect requires understanding and addressing the factors that put people at risk for or protect them from violence. 7 Everyone benefits when children have safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments.

Overview Arthritis that develops in children is called childhood arthritis (or juvenile arthritis). A 1 Childhood arthritis begins when the immune system becomes overactive, leading to joint and body swelling. Childhood arthritis can cause pain, loss of motion, and permanent damage in the joints. This can make it hard for a child to walk, play, or dress themselves. It can also result in disability. Living with childhood arthritis About 220,000 U.S. children under 18 have arthritis. 1 Childhood arthritis is more common among certain groups in the United States, including children who are Black or African American and whose parents have lower levels of education.

Compared to children with healthy weight, children with obesity are at a higher risk for asthma, sleep apnea, bone and joint problems, type 2 diabetes, and other health issues. While there is no one solution, there are many ways parents and caregivers can help children have a healthy weight and set up lifelong healthy habits. Why it matters About 1 in 5 American children have obesity. Compared to children with healthy weight, children with obesity are at a higher risk for asthma, sleep apnea, bone and joint problems, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and mental health concerns like depression and anxiety. Children with obesity are more likely to have obesity as adults. Adults with obesity have higher risks for stroke, many types of cancer , heart disease, type 2 diabetes, premature death and mental health issues. Factors that influence obesity include genes, eating patterns, physical activity levels, access to health care, and sleep routines. Also, conditions where we live, learn, work, and play affect access to healthy food and safe places to be physically active. Though there is no one solution to addressing obesity, there are many ways parents and caregivers can help children have a healthy weight and set up lifelong healthy habits at home. Here are a few ways families can help prevent or address obesity. 1. Model a healthy eating pattern Offer a variety of fruits and vegetables throughout the day. Frozen and canned fruits and vegetables are often less expensive than fresh and are still good for you. Look for low sodium or no salt added vegetables and fruits packed in water or 100% fruit juice. Adopting healthy eating patterns as a family can help children grow healthfully and maintain a healthy weight as they age.",prevention

Choose healthy drinks Help kids rethink their drink by replacing sugary drinks, such as soda, fruit drinks, and flavored milk, with water, 100% juice, or plain milk. Sugary drinks are the leading sources of added sugars in the American diet. Having too many sugary drinks can lead to weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and dental problems like cavities. The next time you go grocery shopping, read the nutrition labels on the items in your cart to see which ones have added sugars. You may be surprised to see the amount of added sugars in some drinks. Nutrition guidelines recommend that children younger than 2 years have zero foods or drinks with added sugars. From age 2 into adulthood, less than 10 percent of calories per day should come from added sugars. Keep Reading: Nutrition Facts Label and Your Health 2. Move more as a family Physically active youth have stronger muscles and bones, better cardiovascular fitness, and lower body fat than those who are inactive. Regular physical activity can also help improve attention and memory and reduce the risk of depression. Children aged 3–5 years should be physically active throughout the day. Guidelines recommend that children aged 6–17 years get at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day.

People who are sexually active can get chlamydia. This fact sheet answers basic questions about chlamydia. Overview What is chlamydia? Chlamydia is a common STI that can cause infection among men and women. It can cause permanent damage to a woman's reproductive system. This can make it difficult or impossible to get pregnant later. Chlamydia can also cause a potentially fatal ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy that occurs outside the womb). Signs and symptoms How do I know if I have chlamydia? Chlamydia often has no symptoms, but it can cause serious health problems, even without symptoms. Chlamydia often has no symptoms, but it can cause serious health problems, even without symptoms. If symptoms occur, they may not appear until several weeks after having sex with a partner who has chlamydia. Symptoms in women Even when chlamydia has no symptoms, it can damage a woman's reproductive system. Women with symptoms may notice: An abnormal vaginal discharge A burning sensation when peeing Symptoms in men Men with symptoms may notice: Penis discharge A burning sensation when peeing Pain and swelling in one or both testicles (although this is less common) Symptoms from rectal infections Men and women can also get chlamydia in their rectum. This happens either by having receptive anal sex, or by spread from another infected site (such as the vagina). While these infections often cause no symptoms, they can cause: Rectal pain Discharge Bleeding See your healthcare provider if you notice any of these symptoms. You should also see a provider if your partner has an STI or symptoms of one. Symptoms can include an unusual sore, a smelly discharge, burning when peeing, and bleeding between periods.

If you are sexually active, have an honest and open talk with your healthcare provider. Ask them if you should get tested for chlamydia or other STIs. How it spreads How is chlamydia spread? You can get chlamydia by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex without a condom with someone who has the infection. A pregnant woman with chlamydia can give the infection to her baby during childbirth. Prevention How can I reduce my risk of getting chlamydia? The only way to completely avoid STIs is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex. If you are sexually active, the following things can lower your chances of getting chlamydia: Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with a partner who has been tested and does not have chlamydia Using condoms the right way every time you have sex I'm pregnant. If I have chlamydia, how can I protect my baby from getting it? If you are pregnant and have chlamydia, you can give the infection to your baby during delivery. This can cause serious health problems for your baby. If you are pregnant, talk to your healthcare provider about getting the correct examination, testing, and treatment . Treating chlamydia as soon as possible will make health problems for your baby less likely. Testing and diagnosis Should I be tested for chlamydia? If you are sexually active, have an honest and open talk with your healthcare provider. Ask them if you should get tested for chlamydia or other STIs. If you are a sexually active gay or bisexual man, you should get tested for chlamydia every year. If you are a sexually active woman, you should get tested for chlamydia every year if you are: Younger than 25 years 25 years and older with risk factors, such as new or multiple sex partners, or a sex partner who has a sexually transmitted infection Testing is also recommended during pregnancy in some cases .",condition

Your healthcare provider may ask you to provide a urine sample for testing, or they might use (or ask you to use) a cotton swab to get a vaginal sample. Treatment and recovery Is there a cure for chlamydia? Yes, the right treatment can cure chlamydia . It is important that you take all of the medicine your healthcare provider gives you to cure your infection. Do not share medicine for chlamydia with anyone. When taken properly it will stop the infection and could decrease your chances of having problems later. Although medicine will stop the infection, it will not undo any permanent damage caused by the disease. Repeat infection with chlamydia is common. You should receive testing again about three months after your treatment, even if your sex partner(s) receives treatment. When can I have sex again after my chlamydia treatment? You should not have sex again until you and your sex partner(s) complete treatment. If given a single dose of medicine, you should wait seven days after taking the medicine before having sex. If given medicine to take for seven days, wait until you finish all the doses before having sex. If you've had chlamydia and took medicine in the past, you can still get it again. This can happen if you have sex without a condom with a person who has chlamydia. What happens if I don't get treated? The initial damage that chlamydia causes often goes unnoticed. However, chlamydia can lead to serious health problems. In women, untreated chlamydia can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Some of the complications of PID are: Formation of scar tissue that blocks fallopian tubes Ectopic pregnancy ( pregnancy outside the womb ) Infertility (not being able to get pregnant) Long-term pelvic/abdominal pain Men rarely have health problems from chlamydia.

Signs and symptoms of chlorine exposure depend on how you were exposed. Get away from the area, get clean, and get help if exposed. Chlorine can explode with many common substances. Overview Chlorine is a chemical element commonly used in some jobs and is found in some household products, like bleach. Chlorine has the following traits: Yellow-green gas under normal conditions Smells like bleach Dissolvable in water Liquid when pressurized and kept cool Chlorine is turned into a liquid for storage and transport. When liquid chlorine is released, it quickly turns into a gas that stays close to the ground and spreads quickly. Warning! Chlorine can explode or create explosive products with many common substances. They include: acetylene, ether, turpentine, ammonia, fuel gas, hydrogen, and finely divided metals. Signs and symptoms Most people will smell the chemical or feel irritation that tells you that you are exposed to chlorine. Exposure for a long time may affect people's ability to sense the chemical. Some people with asthma or other lung diseases may be more sensitive to breathing chlorine than others. Effects depend on how the person was exposed, how much they were exposed to, and how long they were exposed for. When chlorine gas touches moist tissues (like the eyes, throat, and lungs) it creates an acid that can hurt these tissues. If high amounts are breathed in, breathing problems may show up right away.",condition

Exposure Warning! Household chlorine bleach can release chlorine gas if it is mixed with certain other cleaning products. Do not mix household cleaners! If chlorine is in the air, people can be exposed through skin or eye contact, or breathing in the chlorine gas. If chlorine is in water, people can be exposed by touching or drinking water that contains chlorine. Because chlorine gas is heavier than air, it will sink to lower areas and increase the risk of exposure there. Chlorine in food Chlorine is unlikely to be eaten or drunk, because it has a very bad smell and taste. Do not use or eat food that smells, tastes, or looks unusual. Do not eat food that may have touched liquid chlorine if the food is not in a glass or metal container. If the food is in an unbroken sealed glass or metal container, it should not be affected by chlorine. Wash the outside of the container before using. Follow any directions by local authorities. What to do if you are exposed Get away Get away from the area where the chlorine was released and breathe fresh air. Outdoors If the chlorine release was outdoors, go indoors and shelter in place . Make sure windows are closed and ventilation systems are turned off to make sure the chlorine does not come inside. If you cannot go indoors, leave the area where the chlorine was released.

Leave the area until the gas has gone away. If you cannot get away, go to the highest ground possible because chlorine is heavier than air and will sink. Get clean Get clean by taking off all clothes, jewelry, and accessories and showering as soon as you can. Showering is the best method for removing chlorine from your body. If you cannot take off all layers, take off as many clothes as you can. Take your clothes off If clothes are frozen to your body, do not try to remove until no longer frozen. Instead, begin washing with a lot of lukewarm water. Then remove your clothes. Do not pull clothing over your head. If you must pull clothing over your head, close your eyes and mouth, and hold your breath. This will stop the chlorine from getting in your eyes, nose, or mouth. Put clothes in a plastic bag. Drop clothes to the floor. If you wear contact lenses, take them out and place them with your clothing. Do not put contact lenses back in. Wash your body Wash your hair, face, and hands, and then wash the rest of your body. Wash from your head to your feet, including armpits and groin, with lots of lukewarm water and mild soap for several minutes. Finish with a plain water rinse. Try not to let the water run into your eyes, nose, or mouth. Do not scrub! If your eyes are burning or you can't see normally, wash your eyes for 10–15 minutes with lukewarm water. Do not use eye drops. Dry your face, then tilt your head back and dry your hair, and then dry down your body. Use anything that will soak up water. Drop used things to the floor. Dress in any available clean clothes to prevent hypothermia (low body temperature). This is especially important if temperatures are cool. Clear the dirty items If emergency response services are available, leave used items on the floor and report where they are to emergency teams.

Place the bags in an area where other people are unlikely to disturb them and touch chlorine. Inform local authorities of the location of the bags for pick up. Get help Get help right away by calling 911, going to the hospital if local officials say it is safe to leave your home, or calling the Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222. Treatment If someone has swallowed chlorine, do not force vomiting. No known cure exists for chlorine exposure. Treatment involves removing chlorine from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care. Symptoms can be treated in a hospital setting or by trained emergency personnel. Long-term health effects Short exposure Lung health usually returns to normal within 7 to 14 days. Although most people recover completely, symptoms and lung issues may continue for those more seriously exposed. Exposure to chlorine can lead to reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS), asthma caused by chemicals. Long term exposure This often occurs in the workplace. Teeth may be weakened.

The disease hasn't been shown to infect people. However, it might be a risk to people if they have contact with or eat meat from animals infected with CWD. Overview Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease that affects deer, elk, moose and similar animals. It has been reported in the United States, Canada, Norway, Finland, Sweden and South Korea. No CWD infections in people have ever been reported. And it's not known if people can even get infected with CWD. However, CWD is related to another prion disease in animals that does infect people. So, it is considered a theoretical risk to people. Some studies in monkeys suggest they can get CWD by eating meat or brain tissues of infected deer or elk. These studies raise concerns CWD may also pose a risk to people. Exposure risks In the United States, CWD was first identified in the 1960s in captive deer. In 1981, the first wild deer with CWD was reported. Since then, the disease has been reported in wild deer in more than half of U.S. states. It's possible that CWD is also in other states but hasn't been reported yet. Once the disease is established in an area, the CWD prions can stay in the environment (soil) for years. If CWD could spread to people, it would most likely be by eating meat from an infected animal. A CDC survey of U.S. residents showed nearly 1 in 5 said they had hunted deer or elk. More than 6 in 10 said they had eaten venison or elk meat. These groups would likely be most at risk if CWD spreads to people. Causes Chronic wasting disease is a type of prion disease. Prions are proteins that are normally found in the body. In rare cases, the proteins misfold, causing serious symptoms in the animal or person affected. Once a person or animal gets sick, the disease moves to the brain and spine and eventually leads to death.",condition
cdc_0196_2,Chronic Wasting Disease,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-wasting/about/index.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Scientists believe CWD proteins (prions) spread between animals through body fluids like feces, saliva, blood, or urine. This can occur either through direct contact or indirectly through contamination of soil, food or water. Reducing risk When hunting in areas with CWD activity, follow these steps to reduce your risk of contact with the disease: Do not shoot, handle or eat animals that look sick or act strangely. Do not touch or eat meat from animals found dead (roadkill) When field-dressing a deer or handling meat: Wear latex or rubber gloves Avoid handling its internal organs, especially the brain or spine. Do not use knives or other tools you use in your kitchen. Check state wildlife and health department recommendations before you hunt. See if they recommend or require testing animals for CWD in the hunting area. Recommendations vary by state. Strongly consider having the deer or elk tested for CWD before you eat the meat. If your deer is processed commercially, consider asking to have your animal be processed individually. This ensures you are only getting meat from your animal. If your animal tests positive for CWD, do not eat meat from that animal. What CDC is doing CDC has been working with health officials in states where CWD has been reported for decades. We are collaborating to watch for potential CWD cases in people. By surveying hunters' health in states with long CWD histories, we hope to have early warnings if it spreads to people.

cdc_0197_1,Classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/creutzfeldt-jakob/about/index.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"May 13, 2024 Classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease What to know Classic CJD is a quick-moving, always fatal disease that occurs worldwide. It affects the brain and causes dementia and other problems. CJD mostly occurs in older adults. There is no treatment or cure. It usually leads to death within a year from when symptoms begin. Overview CJD is caused by a prion, a type of infectious protein. Prions trigger normal proteins in the body to misfold, leading to CJD. CJD causes dementia and other neurologic problems. Once symptoms begin, it can lead to death in months to a year. Classic CJD occurs worldwide in older adults, with the average age in the late 60s. Very few cases occur in people who are younger than 30 years old. CJD occurs worldwide with an estimated rate of about one to two illness per one million population members per year. In recent years in the United States, about 500-600 cases have been reported per year. Types There are three main types of CJD infection: Sporadic The vast majority of all CJD cases reported (about 85 percent) are called sporadic. These types of cases occur when prion proteins already in the body misfold for some unknown reason. The result is disease that breaks down the brain's functions. Some cases are fatal within a few months of the first symptoms, and most are fatal within a year. Familial About 5-15 percent of CJD cases occur because the person has inherited a mutation in the prion protein gene. A person with CJD with a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) who also has the disease would have familial CJD. Iatrogenic Iatrogenic cases are caused by contact with prions in a healthcare setting or due to biological products. There have been six known CJD cases caused by surgical or medical equipment contaminated with prions is used on another patient. People who received prion-contaminated human growth hormone prior to 1978 may also develop iatrogenic CJD. Even 50 years later, cases are still being identified.",condition
cdc_0197_2,Classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease,CDC,https://www.cdc.gov/creutzfeldt-jakob/about/index.html,Public Domain,2026-01-10,"Finally, cases can occur in people who receive a transplant of specific materials. These include corneal (eye) grafts or dura mater (a membrane in the brain and spinal cord) grafts. If the donor had CJD that was not discovered before the donation, recipients can contract CJD. How it affects your body People with CJD suffer from dementia. Other symptoms may include trouble walking, sudden jerky movements, and visual disturbances. CJD patients usually die within one year following the onset of symptoms. Testing and diagnosis Healthcare providers can diagnose an illness as a suspect case based on: Symptoms and course of illness Tests of a person's spinal fluid Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), a brain scan EEG, a test of electrical activity in the brain. The only way to confirm CJD is through testing brain tissue from a biopsy or an autopsy. Treatment and Prognosis Classic CJD is always fatal, usually within a few months. There is unfortunately no therapy that will slow or stop the progression of disease. So, treatment involves supportive care to make the patient more comfortable. Similar diseases Though they have very similar names, CJD and variant CJD (vCJD) are not the same disease. Both are prion diseases. However, variant CJD is tied to eating meat from cows infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (sometimes called Mad Cow Disease). CJD, sometimes called ""classic CJD"" to avoid confusion, mostly occurs sporadically. Unlike variant CJD, classic CJD is not caused by any other prion disease. In general, classic CJD affects people older than 55 while vCJD cases were younger, with an average age of 28. Classic CJD progresses much more quickly, causing death in an average of 4-5 months, while vCJD averages more than a year.

Complementary Versus Alternative According to a 2012 national survey, many Americans—more than 30 percent of adults and about 12 percent of children—use health care approaches that are not typically part of conventional medical care or that may have origins outside of usual Western practice. When describing these approaches, people often use “alternative” and “complementary” interchangeably, but the two terms refer to different concepts: If a non-mainstream approach is used together with conventional medicine, it’s considered “complementary.” If a non-mainstream approach is used in place of conventional medicine, it’s considered “alternative.” Most people who use non-mainstream approaches also use conventional health care. In addition to the terms complementary and alternative, you may also hear the term “functional medicine.” This term sometimes refers to a concept similar to integrative health (described below), but it may also refer to an approach that more closely resembles naturopathy (a medical system that has evolved from a combination of traditional practices and health care approaches popular in Europe during the 19th century).

It is grown in subtropical regions around the world, including the southern border areas of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. Aloe was used in ancient Greece, Rome, Babylonia, and China. Historically, it was used for skin conditions and was thought to prevent premature graying of hair and promote wound healing. Aloe is used topically (applied to the skin) and orally. Topical use of aloe is promoted for acne, psoriasis, lichen planus (a very itchy rash on the skin or in the mouth), oral submucous fibrosis (a disease that causes scars and tissue fibrosis and can involve a burning sensation in the mouth), burns, and skin damage from radiation therapy. Oral use of aloe is promoted for weight loss, diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease (a group of conditions caused by gut inflammation that includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis). Aloe products can be made from various parts of the aloe leaf, including the gel (from the inner leaf), latex (from the leaf’s outer layer), and whole crushed leaf (containing the gel and latex). In 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a ruling that required manufacturers to remove aloe latex from over-the-counter laxative products because of a lack of safety data. The International Agency for Re on Cancer has classified whole leaf extract of aloe vera as a possible carcinogen in humans. (This form, called non-decolorized, has not undergone activated carbon treatment to remove toxic anthraquinone components.) How Much Do We Know?

A small amount of re suggests that aloe taken orally may reduce blood sugar and HbA1c in people with diabetes. A small study showed that a specific aloe gel product taken orally for 8 weeks modestly reduced weight and fat mass in adults with obesity or overweight who had diabetes or prediabetes. There is interest in using aloe for many other conditions, but there isn’t enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful for those conditions, which include eczema, diabetic foot ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, and ulcerative colitis. What Do We Know About Safety? Topical use of aloe gel is generally well tolerated; however, there have been occasional reports of burning, itching, rash, and eczema. Re studies suggest that short-term use of oral aloe gel up to 42 days is safe. Oral use of aloe latex can cause abdominal pain, cramps, and diarrhea. Oral consumption of aloe leaf extracts (for as little as 3 weeks and as long as 5 years) has been related to cases of acute hepatitis. Some animal studies have noted an association between a non-decolorized extract of aloe vera leaf taken orally and gastrointestinal cancer in rats and mice; most toxicity and safety studies in animals have tested non-decolorized whole leaf extract of aloe vera, which is not commonly used by consumers.

It contains several bioactive compounds, including a group of substances known as withanolides. Withanolides have been associated with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Ashwagandha has been in use as a medicinal plant for thousands of years, especially in traditional Ayurvedic medicine. Currently, ashwagandha supplements are often promoted for stress and anxiety, sleep, male infertility, and athletic performance. These supplements typically contain ashwagandha root, leaf, or root/leaf extracts. Ashwagandha has also been promoted for COVID-19, but there is not sufficient high-quality evidence to support its use. How Much Do We Know? Many clinical trials (studies in people) have looked at the use of ashwagandha for a variety of health conditions. However, many of the studies have had small sample sizes and have used a variety of ashwagandha preparations. What Have We Learned? Re shows that some ashwagandha preparations may be effective for insomnia and stress. However, evidence is unclear about its effects on anxiety. There is some limited evidence that suggests that taking ashwagandha for 2 to 4 months may increase testosterone levels and sperm quality. There isn’t enough evidence to determine if ashwagandha is helpful for any other health conditions, such as asthma, athletic performance, cognitive function, diabetes, menopause, and female infertility. There is not enough high-quality evidence suggesting that ashwagandha is helpful in treating COVID-19. What Do We Know About Safety?

Although it is rare, there have been a number of cases that link liver injury to ashwagandha supplements. Ashwagandha should be avoided during pregnancy and should not be used while breastfeeding. Ashwagandha is not recommended for people who are about to have surgery, or for those who have autoimmune or thyroid disorders. There is evidence that ashwagandha might interact with some medications, including those for diabetes and high blood pressure, medicines that decrease the immune system response (immunosuppressants), sedatives, anti-seizure medications (anticonvulsants), and thyroid hormone medications.

It has been used as a calming agent in traditional Chinese medicine and as an adaptogen. (Adaptogenic herbs are thought to help the body resist physiological and psychological stress.) Asian ginseng is one of several types of ginseng. The terms “red ginseng” and “white ginseng” refer to Asian ginseng that is prepared in two different ways. The part of the plant most frequently used for health purposes is the root. Asian ginseng has been promoted for stress, cognitive function, flu, fatigue, athletic performance, diabetes, aging, asthma, anxiety, and other conditions. Asian ginseng contains many substances; those thought to be most important are called ginsenosides (or panaxosides). How Much Do We Know? The amount of re on Asian ginseng for various conditions has gradually increased over recent years. Most of the clinical trials have been small, with fewer than 200 participants, and shorter than 3 months. Larger multicenter studies that last longer than 3 months are needed to improve the clinical evidence of Asian ginseng for different conditions. What Have We Learned? A small amount of re has suggested that Asian ginseng may improve cognitive function, including abstract thinking, attention, arithmetic skills, and reaction time, in middle-aged adults but not in young adults. Any benefit from Asian ginseng on memory has appeared to depend on the addition of ginkgo.

However, not all re agrees on Asian ginseng’s possible benefits for fatigue. A 2022 review of 20 studies (1,295 participants) found that Asian ginseng improved many cardiometabolic factors in people with prediabetes and diabetes, including fasting blood glucose levels, total cholesterol, and certain inflammatory markers. But re on the use of Asian ginseng for improving blood sugar control in people with diabetes is overall inconclusive and conflicting. Some re shows that taking oral Asian ginseng seems to improve sexual function in people with erectile dysfunction (ED). Asian ginseng has also been studied in adults with symptoms of ED associated with an enlarged prostate, and one small study suggested it may improve some aspects of sexual function. The majority of re shows that Asian ginseng does not improve athletic performance. There is interest in using Asian ginseng for many other conditions, including aging, asthma, and anxiety, but there isn’t enough reliable information to say whether it might be helpful for these conditions. What Do We Know About Safety? Short-term oral use (by mouth, up to 6 months) of Asian ginseng in recommended amounts appears to be safe for most people. However, questions have been raised about its long-term safety, and some experts recommend against its use for infants, children, and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

Its root has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine, often in combination with other herbs. Astragalus is considered an adaptogen, which is a natural substance theorized to stimulate the body’s resistance to physical, environmental, and emotional stress. Sometimes combined with other herbs, astragalus has been promoted as a dietary supplement for many conditions, including upper respiratory infections, allergic rhinitis (hay fever), asthma, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes. It’s also promoted to improve the response of the immune system. Topical use (application to the skin) of astragalus is promoted for wound healing. How Much Do We Know?

Recent scientific reviews have evaluated the re on astragalus for various conditions. A 2024 review of 20 studies (involving 953 adults with type 2 diabetes) found that taking astragalus in addition to the medicine metformin reduced fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin A1C more than metformin alone.

Its dark berries resemble blueberries. The berries and leaves of the bilberry plant have been used as medicine. Extracts from bilberry fruits and leaves have traditionally been used for conditions related to vision, elevated blood sugar levels, and several cardiovascular disorders. It has been reported that during World War II, British pilots ate bilberry jam, thinking it would improve their night vision. Although this may have been superstition or a deliberate hoax to help conceal improvements in radar, it prompted re on bilberry and night vision. Today, bilberry is promoted as a dietary supplement for eye conditions, circulatory problems, and other conditions. How Much Do We Know? Some re has been done in people on the effect of bilberry on various conditions, but many of the studies did not use rigorous methods and did not include enough study participants to allow definite conclusions to be reached.

Its fruit is too sour to eat raw, but the fruit, peel, and essential oils are used in cooking, as flavorings in beer and spirits, and to add aromas to perfumes. Bitter orange is currently promoted as a dietary supplement for weight loss, sports performance, and other uses. Bitter orange oil is used topically and in aromatherapy. The fruit of bitter orange contains p -synephrine and other naturally occurring chemicals. p -Synephrine is structurally similar to ephedrine, the main component in the herb ephedra, but p -synephrine has different pharmacologic properties (how it acts in the body). In 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the use of ephedrine alkaloids (compounds found in Ephedra sinica and some other plants) in dietary supplements because of safety concerns. Prior to the ban, ephedra was an ingredient in some dietary supplements promoted for weight loss, increased energy, and enhanced athletic performance. Bitter orange products became more popular after ephedra was taken off the market and have been promoted as ephedra alternatives. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has placed “synephrine (bitter orange)” on its current list of banned drugs, listing it as a stimulant. How Much Do We Know? Studies have been done on the effects of bitter orange on weight loss or athletic performance in people, but most of them were small, some were not scientifically rigorous, and many evaluated the effects of products that contain a combination of ingredients, making it difficult to distinguish the effects of bitter orange from those of the other components.

Several small studies have evaluated the effects of bitter orange, with or without caffeine, on athletic performance. The results were inconsistent, but most of the studies did not show a beneficial effect. It is unclear whether applying bitter orange oil to the skin is helpful for fungal infections of the skin (ringworm, athlete’s foot, or jock itch). The one study that tested bitter orange oil for these infections did not compare it to other treatments or a placebo, so the study’s results are difficult to interpret. Bitter orange oil has been used in aromatherapy for various conditions including anxiety and insomnia, but it is unclear whether this is beneficial. What Do We Know About Safety? Bitter orange is likely safe when used orally in amounts commonly found in foods. Bitter orange oil is generally well tolerated when used topically or in aromatherapy. Serious concerns have been raised about possible risks of dietary supplements containing bitter orange. Cases of serious medical events, including abnormal heart rhythms, heart attacks, and strokes, have been reported in people who had taken bitter orange products, but most of the products contained multiple ingredients rather than bitter orange alone. Therefore, it is unclear whether bitter orange (or its component p -synephrine) played a role in causing the events. Evidence regarding the effects of bitter orange on the cardiovascular system is inconclusive. Some studies indicate that bitter orange raises blood pressure and heart rate, but others do not.

Bromelain is promoted as a dietary supplement for a variety of purposes including postoperative pain after wisdom tooth extraction, sinusitis, osteoarthritis, and exercise-induced muscle soreness. Bromelain is used topically (applied to the skin) as a prescription drug in the treatment of serious burns. How Much Do We Know? A small number of studies have been done on the use of bromelain taken orally (by mouth) for reducing symptoms of sinusitis and reducing pain and swelling after wisdom tooth extraction. For other conditions, either very little re has been done or studies have only evaluated products that contain a mixture of bromelain and other ingredients, and therefore the effects of bromelain alone are unclear. In 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a drug product containing bromelain for topical use for debridement (removal of dead tissue or contaminants) of severe burns in adults. The product is also approved for this purpose in the European Union. What Have We Learned? There is not enough high-quality re to say whether oral bromelain should be recommended for sinusitis. Some studies suggest that oral bromelain might be helpful for reducing some symptoms associated with wisdom tooth surgery. Debridement with topical bromelain has been successfully administered by health professionals as an alternative to surgical debridement. What Do We Know About Safety? When taken orally, bromelain seems to be well tolerated. The most commonly reported side effects have been stomach upset and diarrhea.",natural_remedy

The name, butterbur, is attributed to the traditional use of its large leaves to wrap butter in warm weather. The names for this plant in some other languages translate as “rain hat” or “hat plant,” reflecting another use of the large leaves. Butterbur has been used for health purposes for many centuries. In the Middle Ages, the odor and smoke from burning butterbur roots were thought to fight plague. Today, butterbur is promoted as a dietary supplement for migraine, allergic rhinitis (hay fever), and other conditions. How Much Do We Know? There have been several studies of butterbur for migraines and allergic rhinitis (hay fever) in people, so we have some knowledge of its effects on these two conditions. What Have We Learned? A butterbur root extract may reduce the frequency of migraines in adults and children when taken orally. In 2012, the American Academy of Neurology recommended butterbur for preventing migraines. However, the Academy stopped recommending it in 2015 because of serious concerns about its safety. Studies of a butterbur leaf extract suggest that it may be helpful for symptoms of allergic rhinitis when taken orally. Little re has been done on butterbur for conditions other than migraine and allergic rhinitis, and no conclusions can be reached about its effects for other conditions. What Do We Know About Safety?

The two most common species are U. tomentosa and U. guianensis. Most commercial preparations of cat’s claw in the United States contain U. tomentosa . Indigenous people of the Amazon rainforest have used cat’s claw for centuries to ward off disease. Today, cat’s claw is promoted for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, viral infections, and other conditions. How Much Do We Know?

Today, chamomile is promoted for the common cold, indigestion, anxiety, insomnia, excessive crying in infants (colic), respiratory disorders such as cough and bronchitis, and many other conditions. It is also used topically for some skin conditions and as a mouthwash. How Much Do We Know? Studies of the effectiveness of chamomile for a variety of specific conditions have not produced sufficient reliable evidence to rate clinical usefulness. Also, some studies look at products made of chamomile plus other herbs, so it is difficult to know chamomile’s exact role from those studies. What Have We Learned? Some preliminary studies suggest that a chamomile dietary supplement might be helpful for generalized anxiety disorder and associated depression. Some re has found that products containing certain combinations of herbs that include chamomile may be of benefit for diarrhea in children and for infants with colic. But chamomile alone has not been shown to be helpful for these conditions. Small studies suggest that mouthwashes containing chamomile might prevent or treat swelling or irritation in the mouth resulting from radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or stem cell transplantation. There’s very little information on chamomile’s effect on insomnia. A 2019 review of chamomile use found one study on insomnia, which found no benefit from its use for this sleep disorder.

Cranberry has a history of traditional use in dyes, food, and medicine among Native Americans and later European settlers. Cranberry fruits and leaves were thought to have therapeutic effects on disorders of the bladder, stomach, blood, and liver, and on various conditions like wounds, diabetes, and scurvy. Today, cranberry is commonly promoted for urinary tract infections (UTIs) and recurrent UTIs. Cranberry products are promoted for these common infections in part because of a growing interest in nonantibiotic prevention strategies, given concerns about antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

However, ginkgo has not been shown to be effective for any of the conditions for which it has been studied. What Have We Learned? There’s no conclusive evidence that ginkgo is helpful for any health condition. Ginkgo has not been shown to be beneficial for preventing or slowing the progression of dementia. In three large studies in older adults with normal cognitive function or mild cognitive impairment, supplementation with ginkgo extract did not reduce the risk of dementia.

The first reported cases involved medicinal or dietary supplement products that had been extracted with alcohol or acetone, but other cases have involved kava beverages prepared with water. It has been suggested that the use of undesirable varieties (cultivars) of kava plants or inappropriate parts of the plant may be responsible for liver toxicity; other possibilities include the consumption of kava together with alcohol and the adulteration or contamination of kava products.",natural_remedy

Kava can cause digestive upset, headache, dizziness, and other side effects. Long-term use of high doses of kava may cause kava dermopathy, a condition that involves dry, scaly, flaky skin with reddened eyes and temporary yellow discoloration of the skin, hair, and nails. Kava should not be used together with other substances that have sedative effects, such as benzodiazepines or alcohol. If you take any type of medicine, talk with your health care provider before using kava or other herbal products; some herbs and medicines interact in harmful ways.

The name lavender comes from the Latin verb “lavare,” meaning “to wash.” Lavender’s popular scent has commonly been used as an ingredient in bath products, perfumes, and aromatherapy. Lavender is promoted as an oral (by mouth) dietary supplement for calming anxiety, stress, and other conditions. It is also promoted for aromatherapy and topical use (application to the skin). How Much Do We Know? Studies have been done on the use of lavender products for a variety of conditions, but more high-quality re is needed to reach reliable conclusions about its effectiveness. What Have We Learned? Studies have suggested that a lavender oil product, taken orally, might be beneficial for anxiety, including anxiety with co-occurring symptoms of depression. However, the re has several limitations, such as the small sample sizes of the studies, a lack of independent funding and testing, and a lack of participant diversity. Initial reports of small sample size have indicated that oral lavender capsules or lavender tea might reduce symptoms of depression in some people, but because the re is preliminary, it should be interpreted with caution. Topical (on the skin) lavender does not seem to have an effect on symptoms of depression. One preliminary study with seventy-two postmenopausal women aged 50-65 years suggested that a lavender oil product, taken orally, might offer some relief for menopause-related sexual dysfunction, but more reliable evidence is needed to confirm effects.

One preliminary study suggested that lavender syrup might reduce cough severity in people with COVID-19; however, more reliable evidence is needed to confirm any effects. What Do We Know About Safety? It is likely safe to consume lavender in the amounts typically used in foods. Oral lavender products might be safe in the short-term and in the amounts tested in studies of anxiety or other conditions. However, some people may experience adverse effects such as diarrhea, headache, nausea, or burping. Aromatherapy with lavender oil is considered possibly safe, but it may cause headache or coughing. Topical products containing lavender may cause allergic skin reactions in some people. A few cases of swelling of breast tissue have been reported in children who used topical products containing lavender. However, it’s unclear whether the lavender was responsible for the breast swelling, a condition that can have many causes.

It is used as a flavoring in candy, other foods, and tobacco products. Many “licorice” products sold in the United States do not contain actual licorice. Anise oil, which smells and tastes like licorice, is often used instead. Licorice root has a long history of use, going back to ancient Assyrian, Egyptian, Greek, Arab, Chinese, Tibetan, and Indian cultures. It was used in traditional medicine practices for coughing, asthma, and wound healing, as well as for diseases of the lungs, liver, and arteries. Today, licorice root is promoted as a dietary supplement for digestive, respiratory, and energy support. Topical (applied to the skin) licorice has been promoted for certain skin conditions. How Much Do We Know? Some studies of licorice in people have been completed, but there isn’t enough high-quality evidence to clearly support its use for any health condition. What Have We Learned? Licorice mouth rinse or gargle might reduce ulcer size and pain in people with recurrent canker sores, while topical licorice might reduce ulcer size only.

There’s no good evidence to support the use of licorice for COVID-19. What Do We Know About Safety? Licorice root is generally considered safe as a food ingredient. Licorice contains a component called glycyrrhizin, or glycyrrhizic acid, that can cause serious adverse effects, such as irregular heartbeat and cardiac arrest, especially when consumed in large amounts or in the long term. Even small amounts of glycyrrhizin from licorice root products have been linked to severe adverse effects in people who consume a lot of salt, in people with hypertension, and in people with heart or kidney conditions. Oral licorice products that do not contain glycyrrhizin (deglycyrrhizinated licorice) might be safe for up to 4 months. Topical licorice root may be safe to use in the short term, but it may cause skin irritation in some people. Interactions between licorice and corticosteroids have been reported. Consuming oral licorice extract in large amounts (about 250 grams of licorice per week) during pregnancy is unsafe and can increase the risk of delivery before gestational age of 38 weeks.

It is native to the West Indies and the southeast coast of North America. Its berries have been used for health purposes. Saw palmetto is promoted as a dietary supplement for urinary symptoms associated with an enlarged prostate gland (also called benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH), as well as for male pattern baldness, chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (a frequently painful condition involving inflammation of the prostate), and other conditions. How Much Do We Know? Many studies have been conducted on the usefulness of saw palmetto for urinary tract symptoms associated with prostate enlargement in men. We know enough to conclude that saw palmetto is probably not helpful for this purpose. There is not enough evidence to determine whether saw palmetto is useful for other health purposes. More studies are needed before definitive conclusions can be made. What Have We Learned? A 2023 review of 27 studies on saw palmetto in men with BPH found that this herb, when administered alone, provides little or no benefit for BPH symptoms. Definite conclusions could not be reached about the effects of combinations of herbs that include saw palmetto. Two clinical trials funded by the National Institutes of Health, both of which evaluated saw palmetto alone, were included in this review. One tested a standard dose of saw palmetto; the other tested increasing doses of saw palmetto, up to three times the usual dose. In both studies, saw palmetto did not improve BPH symptoms. Because it had been suggested that saw palmetto products prepared using hexane extraction might be more effective than those prepared in other ways, the reviewers analyzed studies of these products and studies of other products separately.",natural_remedy

What Do We Know About Safety? Saw palmetto is well tolerated. It has been used safely in re studies for up to 3 years. Adverse effects are mild and infrequent; they may include digestive symptoms, dizziness, and headache. Saw palmetto does not appear to affect readings of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, even when taken in higher-than-usual amounts. PSA is a protein produced by the prostate gland.

Soybeans have long been cultivated in Asia. Currently, they are also produced in other parts of the world, including the United States. Common soy foods include tofu, miso, tempeh, edamame, and soy milk. In addition to its food uses, soy is available in dietary supplements. Soy supplements may contain soy protein, isoflavones (compounds similar in structure to the hormone estrogen), or other components. Soy products are promoted for high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, symptoms of menopause, and many other health conditions. How Much Do We Know? Many studies have been conducted on the safety and usefulness of soy products. We know enough to conclude that there are potential beneficial effects on blood cholesterol levels, menopausal hot flashes, breast cancer risk, bone density, and blood pressure. However, effects may vary for different types of soy products and in different populations. What Have We Learned? Consuming soy protein in place of other proteins may lower cholesterol levels to a small extent. Soy isoflavones may not have the same effect. Soy isoflavone supplements or soy protein may help to reduce the frequency and severity of menopausal hot flashes, but the effect may be small, and re results have not been completely consistent. Observational studies indicate that among Asian and Asian-American women, higher dietary intakes of soy are associated with a lower risk of breast cancer. The amounts of soy in Western diets, even among the highest consumers of soy, may be too low for this association to be observed.

Topical (applied to the skin) turmeric is promoted for osteoarthritis. How Much Do We Know? Many studies have been conducted on the safety and usefulness of turmeric or curcumin for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), osteoarthritis, and high cholesterol or other lipid disorders. We don’t know enough to definitively conclude if turmeric or curcumin is beneficial for any health purposes. Highly bioavailable formulations of curcumin, which enhance the body’s ability to absorb the curcumin, may harm your liver. What Have We Learned? It’s challenging to compare the available evidence on turmeric. Oral curcumin products vary in how much curcumin they actually contain, and they often contain substances from other plants, such as piperine from black pepper. Combining curcumin with piperine is one way to improve the bioavailability of curcumin.",natural_remedy

The initial evidence is positive; higher-quality evidence is needed to reach definitive conclusions, and more re is needed to understand the impact of bioavailability on curcumin’s effects. It’s unclear whether topical curcumin ointment has an effect on pain related to knee osteoarthritis. Initial re suggests that oral turmeric or curcumin might improve some NAFLD measures, but it’s unclear which specific measures are consistently improved. Initial re suggests that turmeric or curcumin in an oral or mouthwash formulation might improve symptoms of oral mucositis (tissue swelling and irritation in the mouth) related to cancer treatment. There isn’t enough evidence to definitively conclude whether oral turmeric or curcumin has beneficial effects on other health conditions. What Do We Know About Safety? Conventionally formulated oral turmeric or curcumin (not modified to enhance bioavailability) is likely safe in the recommended amounts for up to 2 or 3 months. Oral turmeric can cause adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting, acid reflux, stomach upset, diarrhea, or constipation. Topical curcumin can cause hives or itching. Many curcumin products with increased bioavailability are on the market, and liver damage has been reported in some people who have consumed these bioavailable formulations. If you notice any liver damage symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, poor appetite, dark urine, or jaundice, stop consuming turmeric or curcumin products immediately and talk with your health care provider.

Valerian has been used medicinally since the times of early Greece and Rome. Historically, valerian was used to treat insomnia, migraine, fatigue, and stomach cramps. Today, valerian is promoted for insomnia, anxiety, stress, and depression. The roots and rhizomes (underground stems) of valerian are used for medicinal purposes. How Much Do We Know? Knowledge about valerian is limited because a relatively small amount of re has looked at valerian’s effects on various conditions. There is not enough evidence to determine whether valerian is useful for any health conditions. What Have We Learned? The evidence on whether valerian is helpful for sleep problems is inconsistent. In its 2017 clinical practice guidelines, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommended against using valerian for chronic insomnia in adults. Three small studies suggest that valerian might be helpful for menopause symptoms, but there is not enough evidence to know for certain. There’s not enough evidence to allow any conclusions about whether valerian is helpful for anxiety, depression, premenstrual syndrome, dysmenorrhea (menstrual cramps), stress, or other conditions.

In parts of Asia, mulberry leaves have been used for tea, wine, bean curd, and noodles. In traditional Chinese medicine, mulberry leaves are used to treat diabetes (“Xiao-ke”) as well as cough, sore throats, fever, and bronchitis. Preparations from white mulberry leaves are sold as dietary supplements for controlling weight and blood glucose. While beyond the scope of this fact sheet, preliminary re suggests that morusin, a compound in the bark of white mulberry, may have antioxidant, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, and neuroprotective activity. However, further study is needed to determine its efficacy. How Much Do We Know? There have been several studies on the potential health benefits and safety of using white mulberry leaf, but most of the studies have been preliminary, and clinical studies (re in people) are limited. What Have We Learned? Several studies suggest that white mulberry may reduce elevated blood glucose levels, but some of these studies have been preliminary or were not conducted in humans. Other trials have found no effect on blood glucose levels. Some studies have shown that white mulberry leaves contain numerous chemical compounds that act as antioxidants and may provide therapeutic benefits. What Do We Know About Safety?

Melatonin is a hormone that your brain produces in response to darkness. It helps with the timing of your circadian rhythms (24-hour internal clock) and with sleep. Being exposed to light at night can block melatonin production. Re suggests that melatonin plays other important roles in the body beyond sleep. However, these effects are not fully understood. Melatonin dietary supplements can be made from animals or microorganisms, but most often they’re made synthetically. The information below is about melatonin dietary supplements. What are the health benefits of taking melatonin? Melatonin supplements may help with certain conditions, such as jet lag, delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, some sleep disorders in children, and anxiety before and after surgery. Jet lag Jet lag affects people when they travel by air across multiple time zones. With jet lag, you may not feel well overall and you may have disturbed sleep, daytime tiredness, impaired functioning, and digestive problems. Re suggests that melatonin supplements may help with jet lag. This is based on medium-sized reviews from 2010 and 2014. Four studies that included a total of 142 travelers showed that melatonin may be better than a placebo (an inactive substance) in reducing overall symptoms of jet lag after eastward flights. Another study of 234 travelers on eastward flights looked at only sleep quality and found low-quality evidence that melatonin may be better than placebo for improving sleep quality. Two studies that included a total of 90 travelers showed that melatonin may be better than a placebo in reducing symptoms of jet lag after westward flights. Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD) People with DSWPD have trouble falling asleep at the usual times and waking up in the morning. They typically have difficulty getting to sleep before 2 to 6 a.m. and would prefer to wake up between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.",natural_remedy
nccih_0061_2,Melatonin,NCCIH (NIH),https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/melatonin,Public Domain,2026-01-11,"Melatonin supplements appear to help with sleep in people with DSWPD, but it’s uncertain whether the benefits outweigh the possible harms. This is based on a clinical practice guideline, a small review, and a more recent study. In 2015, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommended melatonin supplements given at specific times for DSWPD. The recommendation was a weak one, and it came with uncertainty about whether the benefits of melatonin outweigh its potential harms. A 2016 review that looked at a small number of people (52) from two studies showed that melatonin supplements reduced the time it took for people with DSWPD to fall asleep when compared to placebo. On average, it took about 22 minutes less for them to fall asleep. A 2018 randomized controlled trial that lasted 4 weeks and included 307 people with DSWPD found that taking melatonin 1 hour before the desired bedtime combined with going to bed at a set time led to several improvements. Those improvements included falling asleep an average of 34 minutes earlier, better sleep during the first third of the night, and better daytime functioning. Some sleep disorders in children Sleep problems in children can have undesirable effects on their behavior, daytime functioning, and quality of life. Children with certain conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are more prone to sleep problems than other children. There are no overall guidelines on the best approach to improving sleep in children. However, guidelines for specific conditions recommend behavioral treatments, such as good bedtime habits and parent education, as an initial treatment that may be supplemented with medicines. A 2019 review looked at 18 studies of melatonin supplements that included a total of 1,021 children. Most of the studies were small, and all were relatively brief (1 to 13 weeks).",natural_remedy

The effects of melatonin on behavior and daytime functioning, however, weren’t clear because the studies used different ways to measure these outcomes. The list below shows the review’s results on melatonin’s short-term effects for children with specific conditions. Children with ASD fell asleep 37 minutes earlier and slept 48 minutes longer. Children with ADHD fell asleep 20 minutes earlier and slept 33 minutes longer. Children with atopic dermatitis fell asleep 6.8 minutes earlier and slept 35 minutes longer. Children with chronic sleep-onset insomnia fell asleep 24 minutes earlier and slept 25 minutes longer. Because there aren’t many studies on children and melatonin supplements, there is a lot we don’t know about the use of melatonin in children. For example, there are uncertainties about what dose to use and when to give it, the effects of melatonin use over long periods of time, and whether melatonin’s benefits outweigh its possible risks. Because melatonin is a hormone, it’s possible that melatonin supplements could affect hormonal development, including puberty, menstrual cycles, and overproduction of the hormone prolactin, but we don’t know for sure. Because of these uncertainties, it’s best to work with a health care provider if you’re considering giving a child melatonin for sleep problems. Anxiety before and after surgery Anxiety before and after surgery happens in up to 80 percent of patients. Melatonin supplements appear to be helpful in reducing anxiety before surgery, but it’s unclear if it helps to lower anxiety after surgery. This is a based on a 2015 review.

Melatonin supplements may be as effective as standard treatment (the antianxiety medicine midazolam). However, the results on melatonin’s benefits for reducing anxiety after surgery were mixed. Is melatonin helpful for preventing or treating COVID-19? Current re looking at the effects of melatonin on COVID-19 is only in the early stages. There are a few randomized controlled trials (studies evaluating melatonin in people) in progress. At this point, it is too soon to reach conclusions on whether melatonin is helpful for COVID-19. Does melatonin help with cancer symptoms? Studies of the effect of melatonin supplements on cancer symptoms or treatment-related side effects have been small and have had mixed results. Keep in mind that unproven products should not be used to replace or delay conventional medical treatment for cancer. Also, some products can interfere with standard cancer treatments or have special risks for people who’ve been diagnosed with cancer. Before using any complementary health approach, including melatonin, people who’ve been diagnosed with cancer should talk with their health care providers to make sure that all aspects of their care work together. Can melatonin help with insomnia? People with insomnia have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or both. When symptoms last a month or longer, it’s called chronic insomnia. According to practice guidelines from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (2017) and the American College of Physicians (2016), there’s not enough strong evidence on the effectiveness or safety of melatonin supplementation for chronic insomnia to recommend its use. The American College of Physicians guidelines strongly recommend the use of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as an initial treatment for insomnia.

The first review looked at 7 studies that included a total of 263 participants. The results suggested that (1) people taking melatonin may sleep about 24 minutes longer during the daytime, but (2) other aspects of sleep, such as time needed to fall asleep, may not change. The evidence, however, was considered to be of low quality. The other review looked at 8 studies (5 of which were also in the first review), with a total of 300 participants, to see whether melatonin helped promote sleep in shift workers. Six of the studies were high quality, and they had inconclusive results. The review did not make any recommendations for melatonin use in shift workers. Is it safe to take melatonin? For melatonin supplements, particularly at doses higher than what the body normally produces, there’s not enough information yet about possible side effects to have a clear picture of overall safety. Short-term use of melatonin supplements appears to be safe for most people, but information on the long-term safety of supplementing with melatonin is lacking. Also keep in mind: Interactions with medicines As with all dietary supplements, people who are taking medicine should consult their health care providers before using melatonin. In particular, people with epilepsy and those taking blood thinner medications need to be under medical supervision when taking melatonin supplements.

Melatonin may stay active in older people longer than in younger people and cause daytime drowsiness. Melatonin is regulated as a dietary supplement In the United States, melatonin is considered a dietary supplement. This means that it’s regulated less strictly by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) than a prescription or over-the-counter drug would be. In several other countries, melatonin is available only with a prescription and is considered a drug. Products may not contain what’s listed on the label Some melatonin supplements may not contain what’s listed on the product label.

For most of the supplements, the amount of melatonin in the product didn’t match what was listed on the product label. Also, 26 percent of the supplements contained serotonin, a hormone that can have harmful effects even at relatively low levels. Is melatonin safe for children? In addition to issues mentioned above, there are some things to consider regarding melatonin’s safety in children. Parents considering giving their children melatonin should first speak with a health care provider about melatonin use in children. A 2023 study found that 22 out of 25 over-the-counter melatonin gummy products were inaccurately labeled. One product did not contain detectable levels of melatonin. In the remaining products, the melatonin levels ranged from 74 to 347 percent of the labeled quantity (i.e., up to almost 3.5 times more melatonin than reported on the label). Most had more than the label said, with the majority containing between 1.2 to 1.7 times more melatonin than the amount listed.
