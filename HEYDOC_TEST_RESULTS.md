## Test #1 - MILD

**Patient Input:**
> I have a runny nose and sneezing for 2 days. No fever. I'm 28, male, no allergies.

**Expected Urgency:** MILD
**Actual Urgency:** NOT_FOUND ❌

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's take a closer look at what could be going on.

**What this could be (for you):**
- Common cold — This fits the pattern of nasal congestion, runny nose, and sneezing without fever. Colds are very common and often resolve on their own within 7-10 days.
- Mild seasonal allergies — If you don't have diagnosed allergies, these symptoms could still be related to pollen or other environmental triggers. Allergy symptoms tend to involve more itchy, watery eyes along with the nasal congestion.

**What this is less likely to be — and why:**
- Sinus infection — Sinus infections usually involve thick, colored mucus, facial pain/pressure, and at least mild fever. Your symptoms are more consistent with an upper respiratory viral infection.

**Urgency:** MILD
These symptoms, while inconvenient, are not an emergency and can be safely managed at home.

**What you can do now (safe steps):**
1. Use saline nasal spray or rinse to help thin mucus and relieve congestion. Use as directed on the package.
2. Take over-the-counter antihistamine medication like cetirizine (Zyrtec) or loratadine (Claritin) to help reduce nasal symptoms. Follow the dosage instructions on the label.
3. Stay hydrated and get extra rest. These can help your body fight the viral infection.

**Watch-outs — get help right away if:**
- Symptoms worsen or don't start to improve within 7-10 days
- You develop a fever, severe facial pain, or colored nasal discharge
- You have difficulty breathing or swallowing

**Sources:**
- Mayo Clinic - Common Cold Symptoms and Causes
- MedlinePlus - Common Cold

**Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):**
1. Are you experiencing any fever, facial pain/pressure, or colored nasal discharge?
2. Have you noticed if certain activities or environments seem to trigger or worsen the sneezing and runny nose?

## Test #2 - MILD

**Patient Input:**
> I've had a mild headache for a few hours, probably tension. I've been staring at screens all day. 32F, no medications.

**Expected Urgency:** MILD
**Actual Urgency:** MILD ✅

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's take a closer look at this headache.

What this could be (for you):
- Tension headache — Staring at screens for long periods can strain the muscles in the neck and shoulders, leading to a mild, dull headache. This is common with increased screen time.
- Eye strain headache — Prolonged use of digital devices without breaks can cause eye fatigue, leading to a headache, especially in the forehead or temples.

What this is less likely to be — and why:
- Migraine — Migraines typically cause moderate to severe throbbing pain, often one-sided, along with sensitivity to light/sound. Your description of a mild, non-pulsing headache makes migraine less likely.

Urgency: MILD
This headache pattern is common with too much screen time and does not appear to have any concerning red flags.

What you can do now (safe steps):
1. Take a 5-10 minute break from screens. Look away from your devices and focus on something in the distance to give your eyes a rest.
2. Apply a cool compress or ice pack to your forehead or the back of your neck for 10-15 minutes to help relax the muscles.
3. Stay hydrated and try to reduce any other sources of stress or tension.

Watch-outs — get help right away if:
- The headache becomes significantly worse or you develop new symptoms like vision changes, weakness, or confusion.

Sources:
- Mayo Clinic — Tension headache

Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):
1. Have you noticed any neck or shoulder tension along with the headache?
2. Does the pain feel like it's coming from your eyes or forehead specifically?
3. Have you had any recent head injuries or illnesses that could be contributing?

## Test #3 - MILD

**Patient Input:**
> My throat feels a bit scratchy since this morning. No fever, can still swallow fine. 25M.

**Expected Urgency:** MILD
**Actual Urgency:** MILD ✅

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's go through this step-by-step:

What this could be (for you):
- Mild upper respiratory infection - The scratchy throat without fever or swallowing difficulty can fit the early stages of a common cold or viral sore throat. These often start with just minor throat irritation.
- Mild laryngitis - The scratchy feeling could also be early laryngitis, which is inflammation of the vocal cords often caused by viral infections or excessive voice use.

What this is less likely to be - and why:
- Strep throat - While a sore throat can be a symptom of strep, the lack of fever and white patches on the throat makes strep less likely in this case.

Urgency: MILD
The lack of fever, swallowing difficulty, or other concerning symptoms suggests this is likely a mild, self-limiting viral upper respiratory issue that can be managed at home.

What you can do now (safe steps):
1. Sip warm fluids like tea or broth to soothe your throat.
2. Use over-the-counter lozenges or sprays as needed for throat discomfort, but don't exceed dosage on the label.
3. Rest your voice as much as possible.
4. Monitor for any worsening symptoms like fever, difficulty swallowing, or colored mucus - if those develop, it would warrant seeing a doctor.

Watch-outs - get help right away if:
- You develop fever, difficulty swallowing, or noticeable white patches on your throat, as those could indicate a more serious infection.

Sources:
- MedlinePlus - Sore Throat

Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):
1. Have you had any other symptoms besides the scratchy throat, like runny nose or cough?
2. When did you first notice the scratchy throat, and has it been getting worse, staying the same, or improving?
3. Have you been using your voice a lot more than usual lately?

## Test #4 - MILD

**Patient Input:**
> I have some muscle soreness in my legs after running yesterday. First time running in months. 30F.

**Expected Urgency:** MILD
**Actual Urgency:** MILD ✅

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's take a closer look at this:

What this could be (for you):
- Muscle soreness/stiffness from exercise you're not used to - When you do any physical activity you haven't done in a while, like running after a break, it's common to have muscle aches and pains afterwards as your body adapts. The cold temperature may also contribute to some stiffness.

What this is less likely to be - and why:
- Severe or worsening muscle injury - Your description of general soreness without severe localized pain, swelling, or inability to move the muscle group suggests this is more of a normal exercise-related response rather than a serious injury.

Urgency: MILD
The muscle soreness you're experiencing is expected and not an emergency. It should improve with some self-care.

What you can do now (safe steps):
1. Apply gentle heat or ice packs to the sore areas for 15-20 minutes a few times per day to help reduce inflammation and discomfort.
2. Gently stretch and do some light movement to keep the muscles from getting too stiff.
3. Consider taking an over-the-counter pain medication like acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed for the soreness, but follow the label directions.

Watch-outs - get help right away if:
- The soreness or pain becomes severe, limits your ability to move, or is accompanied by swelling.
- You experience sudden, severe pain or an inability to put weight on the leg.

Sources:
- Mayo Clinic - Muscle soreness after exercise

Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):
1. Is the soreness only in your legs or are other muscle groups sore as well?
2. On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate the severity of the soreness?
3. Have you noticed any swelling, bruising, or inability to move the muscles?

## Test #5 - MILD

**Patient Input:**
> Feeling a bit bloated after eating. Had a big meal an hour ago. No pain, just uncomfortable. 35M.

**Expected Urgency:** MILD
**Actual Urgency:** MILD ✅

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's take a closer look at this.

What this could be (for you):
- Mild digestive upset - After a large meal, it's common to feel a bit bloated or uncomfortable as your body works to digest the food. This is especially true if the meal was richer or heavier than usual.

What this is less likely to be - and why:
- Food poisoning - While bloating can be a symptom of food poisoning, the lack of pain, fever, or other gastrointestinal symptoms makes that less likely in your case.

Urgency: MILD
The bloating and discomfort you're experiencing are common after a big meal and don't require urgent medical care. This can usually be managed at home with some simple self-care.

What you can do now (safe steps):
1. Avoid lying down - Staying upright can help gas and bloating pass more easily.
2. Sip water or herbal tea - Hydration can aid digestion. Peppermint or ginger tea may also help relieve bloating.
3. Go for a light walk - Gentle movement can encourage intestinal gas to pass.

Watch-outs - get help right away if:
- The bloating/discomfort becomes severe or you develop sharp/worsening pain, vomiting, fever, or other concerning symptoms.

Sources:
- Mayo Clinic - Bloating after eating

Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):
1. Have you had any changes to your regular diet or eating habits lately?
2. Do you have any other medical conditions that could be contributing to the bloating?
3. Have you noticed any pattern to when you tend to feel bloated after meals?

## Test #6 - MILD

**Patient Input:**
> Small paper cut on my finger, still bleeding a tiny bit. 22F, healthy.

**Expected Urgency:** MILD
**Actual Urgency:** MILD ✅

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's take a look at this paper cut:

What this could be (for you):
- Minor skin laceration - Paper cuts are very shallow and usually bleed just a small amount before clotting on their own.

What this is less likely to be - and why:
- Anything more serious - The symptom of a small, superficial paper cut on a healthy 22-year-old woman does not suggest any concerning condition.

Urgency: MILD
This is a very minor injury that can be safely managed at home.

What you can do now (safe steps):
1. Rinse the area with clean water to remove any dirt or debris.
2. Apply a small amount of antibiotic ointment and cover with a bandage.
3. Keep the area clean and change the bandage daily until healed.

Watch-outs - get help right away if:
- The bleeding does not stop within 10-15 minutes
- The area becomes increasingly red, swollen, or painful
- You develop signs of infection like pus, fever, or red streaks

Sources:
- Mayo Clinic - First Aid for Cuts and Scrapes

Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):
1. Does the bleeding continue for more than 15 minutes despite pressure?
2. Is there any redness, swelling, or increasing pain in the area?
3. Do you have any other symptoms like fever or feeling unwell?

---

## Test #7 - MILD

**Patient Input:**
> I have dry, itchy skin on my hands. Winter weather. No rash. 40M.

**Expected Urgency:** MILD
**Actual Urgency:** MODERATE ❌

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's take a closer look at your dry, itchy skin on your hands.

What this could be (for you):
- Dry skin/winter itch - The cold, dry winter weather can cause the skin on your hands to become very dry, cracked, and itchy. This is a common issue, especially for men.
- Eczema - Eczema is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that can cause dry, itchy patches. It's often triggered by environmental factors like cold, dry weather.

What this is less likely to be - and why:
- Allergic reaction - There's no mention of a rash or other signs of an allergic response, which is usually more sudden in onset.

Urgency: MODERATE
While very uncomfortable, the dry, itchy skin on your hands does not require urgent medical care at this time.

What you can do now (safe steps):
1. Apply a fragrance-free, thick hand cream or ointment (like petroleum jelly or Aquaphor) liberally after washing hands and before bedtime. This will help seal in moisture.
2. Use lukewarm rather than hot water when washing hands, and limit handwashing. Pat dry instead of rubbing.
3. Consider using a humidifier at home to add moisture to the air.

Watch-outs - get help right away if:
- The dryness and itching becomes severe and unmanageable with home care
- You develop any signs of infection like increased redness, swelling, warmth, or pus

Sources:
- Mayo Clinic - Dry skin
- NHS - Eczema

Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):
1. Does the itchiness come and go or is it constant?
2. Have you noticed any cracking or bleeding of the skin?
3. Have you tried any over-the-counter creams or ointments so far, and if so, did they provide any relief?

## Test #8 - MILD

**Patient Input:**
> Mild heartburn after eating spicy food. Goes away when I sit up. 45F, occasional issue.

**Expected Urgency:** MILD
**Actual Urgency:** MILD ✅

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's take a look at this step-by-step:

What this could be (for you):
- Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) - The spicy food likely triggered your reflux, causing the heartburn. The relief when sitting up suggests the heartburn is related to stomach contents backing up into the esophagus.
- Indigestion - The spicy meal could have caused temporary stomach upset and bloating, leading to the discomfort. This is common after eating rich or acidic foods.

What this is less likely to be - and why:
- Severe peptic ulcer - While ulcers can cause heartburn, the quick resolution with positioning and the lack of persistent pain makes a serious ulcer less likely in this case.

Urgency: MILD
This pattern of temporary, meal-related heartburn that improves with upright positioning is common and not an emergency.

What you can do now (safe steps):
1. Avoid large or spicy meals, especially close to bedtime, to reduce reflux risk.
2. Try an over-the-counter antacid medication like Tums or Rolaids as needed to provide quick relief.
3. Drink water and herbal tea to help dilute stomach acid.

Watch-outs - get help right away if:
- The heartburn becomes more frequent, severe, or persistent despite self-care.
- You develop new symptoms like difficulty swallowing, chest pain, or unexplained weight loss.

Sources:
- MedlinePlus - Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)
- Mayo Clinic - Indigestion

Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):
1. Have you had any trouble swallowing or a feeling of food getting stuck?
2. Is this the first time you've experienced this, or is it a recurring issue?
3. Do you have any other medical conditions we should know about?

## Test #9 - MODERATE

**Patient Input:**
> I've had diarrhea 4 times today. No blood, no fever. Ate out yesterday. 30M.

**Expected Urgency:** MODERATE
**Actual Urgency:** MODERATE ✅

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's gather a bit more information to understand what could be going on.

What this could be (for you):
- Food poisoning - Eating out recently and having acute diarrhea without fever or blood can fit a mild case of food-borne illness. This often causes GI upset and diarrhea within 1-2 days of eating contaminated food.
- Viral gastroenteritis - You may have picked up a stomach bug that is causing the diarrhea. Viral GI illnesses commonly present with diarrhea, sometimes without fever.

What this is less likely to be - and why:
- Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) - The sudden onset after a meal makes a chronic condition like IBS less likely in this case.

Urgency: MODERATE
While diarrhea can be uncomfortable, the lack of red flags like fever, blood, or severe dehydration indicates this can likely be managed at home for now.

What you can do now (safe steps):
1. Stay hydrated - Drink small, frequent sips of water, broth, or an oral rehydration solution like Gatorade to replace fluids and electrolytes.
2. Eat bland, easy-to-digest foods like bananas, rice, applesauce, toast. Avoid dairy, high-fat, and high-fiber foods until the diarrhea improves.
3. Consider taking an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication like Imodium, but check the label for dosage and any interactions with your other medications.

Watch-outs - get help right away if:
- The diarrhea becomes severe, with dehydration, fever, blood, or extreme abdominal pain.
- You are unable to keep any fluids down for more than 24 hours.

Sources:
- Mayo Clinic - Gastroenteritis: Overview

Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):
1. Have you noticed any changes in the appearance or color of the diarrhea?
2. Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting along with the diarrhea?
3. Are you taking any medications regularly that could be contributing?

## Test #10 - MODERATE

**Patient Input:**
> My lower back has been hurting for 3 days. Aches constantly, worse when sitting. No leg numbness. 50M, desk job.

**Expected Urgency:** MODERATE
**Actual Urgency:** MODERATE ✅

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's take a closer look at what could be going on with your lower back pain.

What this could be (for you):
- Muscle strain or spasm - With the constant ache and worsening with sitting, this pattern can fit a lower back muscle strain or spasm. Desk jobs and prolonged sitting can put strain on the lower back muscles.
- Facet joint irritation - The joints between your vertebrae (facet joints) can become irritated from poor posture or overuse, leading to persistent lower back pain that worsens with movement and sitting.

What this is less likely to be - and why:
- Disc herniation - While possible, the lack of radiating leg symptoms makes a disc issue less likely in this case. Disc herniations often cause shooting pains down the leg.

Urgency: MODERATE
The pain is persistent but not worsening rapidly, and there are no red flags present. This can likely be safely managed at home with some self-care measures.

What you can do now (safe steps):
1. Apply heat to the lower back for 15-20 minutes 2-3 times per day to help relax the muscles.
2. Take over-the-counter pain medication like acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed, following label instructions.
3. Try gentle stretches and exercises to maintain mobility, avoiding anything that causes sharp pain.

Watch-outs - get help right away if:
- The pain becomes severe, radiates down the leg, or is accompanied by numbness/weakness.
- You develop fever, chills, or the pain becomes difficult to control.

Sources:
- Mayo Clinic - Lower Back Pain Causes and Risk Factors

Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):
1. Have you experienced any sudden or severe worsening of the pain?
2. Have you noticed any tingling, numbness or weakness in your legs or feet?
3. Have you tried any self-care measures so far, and if so, have they provided any relief?

## Test #11 - MODERATE

**Patient Input:**
> Twisted my ankle yesterday. Swollen and hurts to walk on it, but I can put some weight on it. 25M.

**Expected Urgency:** MODERATE
**Actual Urgency:** MODERATE ✅

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's take a closer look at this ankle injury:

What this could be (for you):
- Ankle sprain - The swelling, pain with walking, and ability to bear some weight are consistent with a typical ankle sprain. This often happens when the ankle twists and overstretches or tears the ligaments.
- Ankle strain - Instead of ligament damage, this could be more of a muscle/tendon strain around the ankle joint from the twisting motion.

What this is less likely to be - and why:
- Fracture - While possible, the ability to bear weight and lack of severe, unrelenting pain makes a fracture less likely in this case.

Urgency: MODERATE
The symptoms indicate a moderate ankle injury that does not require immediate emergency care, but will likely need evaluation and treatment.

What you can do now (safe steps):
1. Rest the ankle as much as possible and avoid putting weight on it.
2. Apply ice packs to the area for 15-20 minutes several times per day to reduce swelling and pain.
3. Gently wrap the ankle with a compression bandage to provide support.
4. Keep the ankle elevated above heart level when possible.

Watch-outs - get help right away if:
- The pain becomes severe and you cannot bear any weight on the ankle
- The swelling does not start to improve within 1-2 days
- You experience numbness, tingling, or significant discoloration of the foot

Sources:
- CDC - Ankle Sprains and Strains: https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/excercise-injury/ankle-sprains.html

Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):
1. On a scale of 0-10, how would you rate the pain in your ankle?
2. Can you describe the swelling - is it bruised, just puffy, or very pronounced?
3. Have you tried putting any weight on the ankle or walking on it at all?

## Test #12 - MODERATE

**Patient Input:**
> Having trouble sleeping for the past 2 weeks. Mind racing, can't fall asleep until 3am. Stressed at work. 35F.

**Expected Urgency:** MODERATE
**Actual Urgency:** MODERATE ✅

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's take a closer look at what could be going on with your sleep troubles.

What this could be (for you):
- Stress/anxiety-induced insomnia — The mind racing and inability to fall asleep until very late at night can fit a pattern of insomnia triggered by high stress levels, which is common in 35-year-old women.
- Disrupted sleep-wake cycle — The delayed sleep onset until 3am suggests your body's natural sleep/wake rhythms may be out of sync, which can happen with significant stress and lifestyle disruptions.

What this is less likely to be — and why:
While some medical conditions like thyroid problems or chronic pain can also cause insomnia, those typically involve additional symptoms like fatigue, weight changes, or daytime pain that aren't mentioned here. This pattern points more to a stress-related sleep disturbance.

Urgency: MODERATE
The insomnia itself, while distressing, is not an emergency. However, prolonged poor sleep can negatively impact health over time, so it's important to address it.

What you can do now (safe steps):
1. Practice good sleep hygiene - Maintain a regular sleep-wake schedule, limit screen time 1-2 hours before bed, keep the bedroom dark and cool.
2. Try relaxation techniques - Deep breathing, meditation, or gentle yoga can help calm the mind before bed.
3. Limit caffeine, alcohol, and daytime napping, which can disrupt your natural sleep cycle.

Watch-outs — get help right away if:
- Your insomnia becomes severe, with no sleep at all for multiple nights
- You develop new symptoms like severe fatigue, weight changes, or unintentional daytime napping

Sources:
- NHS - "How to get to sleep" 
- Mayo Clinic - "Insomnia Causes"

Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):
1. Have you noticed any changes in your energy, appetite, or mood along with the insomnia?
2. Does the insomnia impact your ability to function during the day?
3. Have you tried any sleep aids, either over-the-counter or prescription?

## Test #13 - MODERATE

**Patient Input:**
> Red, itchy rash on my forearms for 3 days. Started after gardening. Spreading slowly. 42F.

**Expected Urgency:** MODERATE
**Actual Urgency:** MODERATE ✅

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's go through this step-by-step:

What this could be (for you):
- Contact dermatitis - The rash started after gardening, which could have exposed your skin to an irritant like plant oils or chemicals that caused an allergic skin reaction. The slow spreading and itchiness are consistent with this.
- Poison ivy/oak - Since you were gardening, you may have come into contact with poison ivy or oak plants, which can cause a characteristic red, itchy rash that spreads over time.

What this is less likely to be - and why:
- Eczema - While eczema can cause red, itchy rashes, the sudden onset after gardening makes this less likely the primary cause.

Urgency: MODERATE
The rash is not an immediate emergency, but the spreading and persistence suggest you may benefit from a doctor's evaluation, especially if it continues to worsen.

What you can do now (safe steps):
1. Avoid further contact with potential irritants by wearing long sleeves and gloves when gardening.
2. Apply an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream 1-2 times per day to help relieve itching and inflammation.
3. Take an oral antihistamine like Zyrtec or Claritin to help with itching.

Watch-outs - get help right away if:
- The rash spreads rapidly or covers a large area of your body.
- You develop fever, severe pain, blistering, or difficulty breathing.

Sources:
- Mayo Clinic — Rashes After Gardening

Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):
1. Has the rash started to spread to any other areas of your body?
2. Have you noticed any pus, crusting, or blisters forming on the rash?
3. Have you had any other symptoms like fever, chills, or general body aches?

## Test #14 - NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H

**Patient Input:**
> I've had a cough for 5 days now. Producing yellow mucus. Low grade fever 99.5F. 38F.

**Expected Urgency:** NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H
**Actual Urgency:** MODERATE ❌

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's take a look at this step-by-step:

What this could be (for you):
- Viral upper respiratory infection (common cold) - The timeline of 5 days, low-grade fever, and yellow mucus production can fit with a viral respiratory illness like a common cold. Colds often cause a cough with thicker mucus as the body tries to clear the infection.
- Early bacterial bronchitis - The prolonged cough (beyond 5-7 days) and low-grade fever could also fit an early bacterial bronchitis, where the airways become inflamed and produce more mucus.

What this is less likely to be - and why:
- Pneumonia - While the cough and fever are present, the lack of severe symptoms like high fever, difficulty breathing, or chest pain makes pneumonia less likely in this case.

Urgency: MODERATE
The symptoms you described, while persistent, do not have any severe red flags that require urgent medical care at this time. However, the cough has lasted longer than typical for a common cold, so medical evaluation may be beneficial if it does not start to improve soon.

What you can do now (safe steps):
1. Continue resting and staying hydrated. Drink plenty of fluids like water, warm teas, or broths.
2. Use over-the-counter cough suppressants or expectorants as directed on the label to help manage the cough and mucus.
3. Consider taking acetaminophen (Tylenol) to help with the low-grade fever and overall body aches.

Watch-outs - get help right away if:
- Your fever spikes above 101°F
- You develop significant chest pain or difficulty breathing
- The cough becomes uncontrolled or you start coughing up blood

Sources:
- Mayo Clinic - Viral Upper Respiratory Infection
- MedlinePlus - Bronchitis

Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):
1. Have you had any recent exposure to someone with a respiratory illness?
2. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions like asthma or COPD?
3. Have you noticed any change in your breathing or ability to catch your breath?

## Test #15 - NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H

**Patient Input:**
> Burning when I urinate since yesterday. Urinating more frequently. 28F, sexually active.

**Expected Urgency:** NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H
**Actual Urgency:** NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H ✅

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's go through this step-by-step:

What this could be (for you):
- Urinary tract infection (UTI) - The symptoms of burning urination and increased frequency are very common signs of a UTI. UTIs are more common in women, especially those who are sexually active.
- Vaginal irritation - Irritation or infection of the vagina or vulva can sometimes cause similar symptoms to a UTI, like burning with urination.

What this is less likely to be - and why:
- Sexually transmitted infection (STI) - While sexually active, the sudden onset and specific urinary symptoms point more to a UTI rather than an STI, which would likely cause other genital symptoms as well.

Urgency: NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H
The burning and increased urination are concerning for a possible UTI that requires antibiotic treatment. While not an emergency, it's important to see a doctor soon to get evaluated and treated properly.

What you can do now (safe steps):
1. Drink extra water to try to flush out the urinary tract.
2. Avoid irritating soaps or products in the genital area.
3. Take an over-the-counter pain medication like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to help with discomfort.

Watch-outs - get help right away if:
- Symptoms get worse or don't start improving within a few days
- You develop a fever, severe pain, or blood in your urine

Sources:
- MedlinePlus - Urinary Tract Infections

Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):
1. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
2. Do you have any lower abdominal or back pain?
3. Have you had a recent sexual partner or new sexual activity?

## Test #16 - NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H

**Patient Input:**
> Ear pain for 2 days, feels blocked. Some fluid draining. 8 year old child.

**Expected Urgency:** NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H
**Actual Urgency:** NOT_FOUND ❌

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's gather some more details about your child's ear pain and symptoms.

**What this could be (for your 8-year-old):**
- Ear infection (otitis media) — The blocked feeling, fluid drainage, and pain for 2 days can fit the pattern of a middle ear infection, which is common in children.

**What this is less likely to be — and why:**
- Swimmer's ear (outer ear infection) - The fluid drainage and blocked sensation point more to a middle ear issue rather than just the outer ear.

**Urgency:** NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H
Ear infections in children often require antibiotic treatment, so it's best to have your child evaluated by a doctor within the next 1-3 days.

**What you can do now (safe steps):**
1. Keep the ear dry - Avoid getting water in the ear until seen by a doctor.
2. Give age-appropriate over-the-counter pain medication like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to help with discomfort.
3. Use a warm compress on the affected ear for 10-15 minutes a few times per day.

**Watch-outs — get help right away if:**
- The pain becomes severe or your child develops a high fever.
- The fluid drainage increases or becomes thick and pus-like.

**Sources:**
- MedlinePlus - Ear Infection in Children

**Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):**
1. Is there any redness, swelling, or tenderness around the outside of your child's ear?
2. Has your child had any recent cold, flu, or sinus symptoms?
3. Does the pain seem to be getting better, worse, or staying the same over the past 2 days?

## Test #17 - NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H

**Patient Input:**
> Persistent sore throat for 5 days. White patches on tonsils. Fever 101F. Hurts to swallow. 22M.

**Expected Urgency:** NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H
**Actual Urgency:** NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H ✅

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's go through this step-by-step:

What this could be (for you):
- Streptococcal (strep) throat — The combination of a persistent sore throat, white patches on the tonsils, and fever fits the typical pattern of strep throat. Strep is a common bacterial throat infection that often causes these symptoms.
- Viral pharyngitis — A viral infection of the throat can also cause a sore throat, fever, and white patches, though the symptoms tend to be a bit milder than strep.

What this is less likely to be — and why:
- Mononucleosis ("mono") — While mono can cause a sore throat, the fever is usually higher (102-104°F) and other symptoms like extreme fatigue are often present.

Urgency: NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H
The persistent fever and difficulty swallowing indicate this may require antibiotic treatment, so you should see a doctor in the next 1-3 days.

What you can do now (safe steps):
1. Take over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to help with the throat pain and fever.
2. Drink plenty of fluids and eat soft, easy-to-swallow foods to stay hydrated.
3. Use lozenges or gargle with warm salt water to soothe your throat.

Watch-outs — get help right away if:
- Your fever spikes higher than 101°F
- You have trouble keeping fluids down
- Your throat pain becomes severe or you have trouble breathing

Sources:
- MedlinePlus — Sore Throat
- CDC — Streptococcal Pharyngitis (Strep Throat)

Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):
1. Have you had any other symptoms like headache, body aches, or swollen lymph nodes?
2. How severe is the throat pain on a scale of 1-10?
3. Have you taken any medications already for the symptoms?

## Test #18 - NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H

**Patient Input:**
> Eye is red and has yellow discharge for 2 days. Crusty in the morning. 30F.

**Expected Urgency:** NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H
**Actual Urgency:** NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H ✅

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's take a closer look at this.

What this could be (for you):
- Bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye) — The redness, yellow discharge, and morning crusting are common signs of a bacterial eye infection. This is especially likely given the 2-day timeline.
- Viral conjunctivitis — While less likely, the red eye and discharge could also fit a viral conjunctivitis. Viral pink eye often starts with a watery discharge before becoming thicker.

What this is less likely to be — and why:
- Allergic conjunctivitis — While your eye is red, the yellow, crusty discharge is more characteristic of an infection rather than an allergic reaction.

Urgency: NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H
Eye infections like this usually require antibiotic eye drops, so it's best to see a doctor soon, within 24-72 hours, to get properly evaluated and treated.

What you can do now (safe steps):
1. Avoid touching or rubbing the infected eye to prevent spreading it.
2. Wash your hands frequently, especially before and after touching the eye.
3. Use a clean, warm washcloth to gently remove any crusting around the eye in the morning.
4. Avoid wearing contact lenses until the infection has cleared.

Watch-outs — get help right away if:
- The redness, discharge, or discomfort gets significantly worse.
- You develop vision changes, severe pain, or sensitivity to light.

Sources:
- CDC - Conjunctivitis (Pink Eye)
- NHS - Conjunctivitis

Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):
1. Have you had any recent eye injuries or surgeries?
2. Are you experiencing any other symptoms like fever, chills, or swollen lymph nodes?
3. Have you been around anyone else with eye infections recently?

## Test #19 - NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H

**Patient Input:**
> Abdominal pain lower left side for 2 days. Crampy, 5/10 pain. Constipated. Hurts more when I move. 55M.

**Expected Urgency:** NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H
**Actual Urgency:** NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H ✅

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's take a closer look at this.

What this could be (for you):
- Diverticulitis - The lower left abdominal pain, cramping, constipation, and worsening with movement can fit a diverticular flare-up. Diverticula are small pouches that can form in the colon and become inflamed, causing this type of pain pattern.
- Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) - The cramping, constipation, and worsening with movement are consistent with an IBS flare-up, especially since you're a 55-year-old male which is a common age range for IBS.

What this is less likely to be - and why:
- Food poisoning or gastroenteritis - While these can cause abdominal pain, the lack of diarrhea and the worsening with movement makes these less likely as the primary cause.

Urgency: NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H
The persistent, worsening abdominal pain with constipation suggests the need for medical evaluation, as this could be a sign of an underlying intestinal issue that may require treatment. It's best to get this checked out within the next 24-72 hours.

What you can do now (safe steps):
1. Take an over-the-counter pain medication like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to help relieve the discomfort, following the dosage instructions on the label.
2. Try a mild laxative or stool softener to help with the constipation, again following label instructions. Avoid strong laxatives.
3. Apply a warm compress or heating pad to the area to see if that provides any relief.
4. Stick to a bland, low-fiber diet until the symptoms improve.

Watch-outs - get help right away if:
- The pain becomes more severe or localized
- You develop a fever, nausea/vomiting, or inability to pass stool/gas

Sources:
- Mayo Clinic - Diverticulitis
- NHS - Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)

Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):
1. Have you noticed any blood in your stool or vomit?
2. Do you have a history of digestive conditions like diverticulosis or IBS?
3. Have you tried any home remedies so far, like laxatives or pain relievers?

## Test #20 - NEEDS_DOCTOR_NOW

**Patient Input:**
> Sharp abdominal pain right lower side for 6 hours. Getting worse. 7/10 pain. Slight fever. Hurts when I walk. 25M.

**Expected Urgency:** NEEDS_DOCTOR_NOW
**Actual Urgency:** NEEDS_DOCTOR_NOW ✅

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's look at this step-by-step:

What this could be (for you):
- Appendicitis — The sharp, worsening right lower abdominal pain that hurts with movement is a classic sign of appendicitis. The slight fever also fits.
- Diverticulitis — Localized lower left or right lower quadrant pain that worsens with movement can also fit diverticular irritation or early diverticulitis.

What this is less likely to be — and why:
- Food poisoning is less likely, as the pain is localized rather than diffuse GI upset.

Urgency: NEEDS_DOCTOR_NOW
The worsening, severe, localized pain with fever requires urgent medical evaluation, as it could indicate appendicitis or another serious abdominal issue.

What you can do now (safe steps):
1. Do not try to tough this out at home. Seek medical care right away, either through your regular doctor or the nearest urgent care clinic.
2. Avoid taking any pain medications, as those could mask important symptoms.
3. Sip small amounts of clear fluids if you can tolerate them, but do not force yourself to eat.

Watch-outs — get help right away if:
- The pain becomes severe and uncontrolled
- You develop persistent vomiting
- You notice blood in your stool

Sources:
- Mayo Clinic — Appendicitis
- NHS — Diverticulitis

Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):
1. Have you had any recent changes in your bowel movements or urination?
2. Do you have any other medical conditions or take any medications regularly?
3. Have you had anything like this happen before?

## Test #21 - NEEDS_DOCTOR_NOW

**Patient Input:**
> Vomiting for 8 hours straight. Can't keep water down. Dizzy when I stand. 35F.

**Expected Urgency:** NEEDS_DOCTOR_NOW
**Actual Urgency:** NEEDS_DOCTOR_NOW ✅

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's take a closer look at what could be going on.

What this could be (for you):
- Severe gastroenteritis or stomach flu - The prolonged vomiting, inability to keep fluids down, and dizziness when standing are classic signs of significant dehydration from a stomach bug. This pattern of symptoms is common with viral gastroenteritis.
- Food poisoning - The rapid onset of severe vomiting can also fit a case of food poisoning, especially if it started shortly after eating. However, the prolonged duration beyond 12-24 hours is less typical of simple food poisoning.

What this is less likely to be - and why:
- Appendicitis - While appendicitis can cause severe abdominal pain and vomiting, the lack of focal right lower quadrant pain or rebound tenderness makes appendicitis less likely in this case.

Urgency: NEEDS_DOCTOR_NOW
The combination of severe dehydration symptoms, inability to keep fluids down, and fever requires prompt medical evaluation and treatment. Waiting longer risks complications like electrolyte imbalances, organ damage, or shock.

What you can do now (safe steps):
1. Keep trying small, frequent sips of water or an oral rehydration solution (like Pedialyte) if you can tolerate it. Avoid caffeinated or alcoholic drinks.
2. If you are still unable to keep any fluids down after 1-2 hours, contact your doctor or go to urgent care right away. Severe dehydration requires IV fluids.
3. Take your temperature and monitor for signs of worsening dehydration like extreme dizziness, confusion, or minimal urination.

Watch-outs - get help right away if:
- Your symptoms significantly worsen or you develop severe abdominal pain, bloody vomit, or fever over 101°F.
- You are unable to keep any fluids down for more than 4-6 hours.

Sources: 
- General clinical guidance (no specific citations available)

Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):
1. Have you had any other symptoms like diarrhea, abdominal pain, or bloody stool?
2. Do you have any chronic medical conditions like diabetes or kidney disease?
3. Have you traveled recently or eaten anything new/risky before this started?

## Test #22 - NEEDS_DOCTOR_NOW

**Patient Input:**
> High fever 103F for 2 days. Chills, body aches, extreme fatigue. Coughing up green phlegm. 60M with diabetes.

**Expected Urgency:** NEEDS_DOCTOR_NOW
**Actual Urgency:** NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H ❌

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's carefully assess this step-by-step:

What this could be (for you):
- Pneumonia or bronchitis - The high fever, chills, cough with colored mucus, and extreme fatigue can fit a lower respiratory infection like pneumonia or bronchitis. These are more common in someone with diabetes.
- Severe influenza (flu) - The abrupt onset of high fever, body aches, and respiratory symptoms can also match the flu, especially with a history of diabetes.

What this is less likely to be - and why:
- Severe COVID-19 - While the respiratory symptoms and fever are concerning, the rapid onset and colored phlegm make COVID-19 less likely as the primary cause. COVID tends to have a slower, drier cough.

Urgency: NEEDS_DOCTOR_24_72H
The high fever and respiratory symptoms in someone with diabetes are concerning and require prompt medical evaluation, likely within 1-3 days.

What you can do now (safe steps):
1. Take acetaminophen (Tylenol) as needed to help reduce fever and body aches, but do not exceed daily limits.
2. Stay well hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids.
3. Get plenty of rest.

Watch-outs - get help right away if:
- Fever spikes higher or lasts more than 3-5 days without improving
- Breathing becomes more difficult or you have trouble catching your breath
- You develop chest pain, confusion, or dizziness

Sources:
- Mayo Clinic - Pneumonia Symptoms
- CDC - Flu Symptoms & Complications

Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):
1. Have you had any change in your breathing or difficulty catching your breath?
2. Have you had any chest pain, dizziness, or confusion?
3. How much are you able to eat and drink right now?

## Test #23 - EMERGENCY

**Patient Input:**
> Severe headache came on suddenly 2 hours ago. Worst headache of my life. Neck feels stiff. 40M.

**Expected Urgency:** EMERGENCY
**Actual Urgency:** EMERGENCY ✅

**HeyDoc Response:**

Okay, let's go through this carefully.

What this could be (for you):
- Thunderclap headache - This type of sudden, severe headache can sometimes be a sign of a serious condition like a ruptured brain aneurysm or stroke. The sudden onset and severe intensity fits this pattern.
- Meningitis - The sudden headache with stiff neck can sometimes indicate an infection like meningitis, which requires urgent medical attention.

What this is less likely to be - and why:
- Tension or migraine headache - While these can be severe, the sudden onset and stiff neck are not typical features.

Urgency: EMERGENCY
Sudden, severe "worst headache" with stiff neck is a medical emergency that requires immediate evaluation.

What you can do now (safe steps):
There are no safe steps to take at home. This requires emergency medical attention right away.

Watch-outs - get help right away if:
- You have any changes in vision, coordination, speech, or consciousness.

Sources:
- Mayo Clinic - Thunderclap headache
- NHS - Meningitis symptoms

Follow-ups (answer these so I can be more accurate):
1. Are you having any trouble speaking, seeing, or moving normally?
2. Do you have a fever or feel generally ill?
3. Is there any known cause for your headache, like a recent head injury?

This is an emergency situation. Please call 911 (or your local emergency number) immediately. Do not wait, as this type of sudden, severe headache with neck stiffness requires urgent medical care. Your safety is the priority here.

## Test #24 - EMERGENCY

**Patient Input:**
> Crushing chest pain for 20 minutes. Radiating to my left arm. Sweating. Short of breath. 55M.

**Expected Urgency:** EMERGENCY
**Actual Urgency:** NOT_FOUND ❌

**HeyDoc Response:**

EMERGENCY
Some of what you described can be a life-threatening medical emergency. Please call 911 (or your local emergency number) now. Severe chest pain with radiating arm pain, shortness of breath, and sweating are concerning signs that require urgent medical evaluation. If you're unsure, it's safest to be seen immediately.

**Patient Input:**
> My face is drooping on one side. Can't lift my right arm. Speech is slurred. Started 30 minutes ago. 65F.

**Expected Urgency:** EMERGENCY
**Actual Urgency:** NOT_FOUND ❌

**HeyDoc Response:**

EMERGENCY
Sudden onset of facial drooping, arm weakness, and slurred speech can indicate a stroke. This requires immediate emergency medical attention.

Please call 911 (or your local emergency number) now. Do not wait - getting rapid treatment for a suspected stroke is critical to minimize potential brain damage. I recommend you call for emergency help immediately.
